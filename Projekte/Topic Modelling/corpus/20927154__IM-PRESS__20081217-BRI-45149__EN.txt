Launch of the Czech Presidency's programme by Czech PM Mirek Topolánek
Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek will launch the Czech Republic's six-month Presidency of the European Union on Wednesday at 9am in a debate with MEPs and Commission President José Manuel Barroso . (The Czech Republic took over from France on 1 January 2009 and Sweden takes over the presidency in the second half of 2009).
MEPs to debate the situation in Gaza
At the opening of the plenary session on Monday, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will make a statement on Gaza and Parliament will debate the situation in Gaza and Israel on Wednesday afternoon. The President of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council and Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic, Karel Schwarzenberg , is heading the EU delegation bound for the Middle East. One of the main objectives of this mission is to find a way to help the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in the current distressing humanitarian situation. The European Commission has announced the release of €3 million towards humanitarian aid.
European gas supplies disrupted after Russia Ukraine dispute
Parliament will debate supply of gas from Russia following statements from Council and Commission. Several European countries say their supplies of Russian gas have been cut sharply amid an energy price dispute between Moscow and Ukraine. Turkey said all its gas supplies via Ukraine had been cut. Romania reported a 75% reduction. Bulgaria, Greece and Macedonia are also seeing shortfalls.
Pesticides legislation: the final lap
Pesticides have a three-stage life-cycle: the placing on the market of new pesticide products; the day-to-day use of pesticides; and the end-of-life or "waste" stage. The legislation submitted to Parliament for approval next week, in two reports, deals only with the first two stages, as waste is covered by other EU laws. MEPs will vote on the two reports endorsing the final shape of the legislation as agreed in negotiations with the Council in December. The legislation will increase the number of pesticide products available in Member States while in due course banning the use of certain dangerous chemicals in these products. Measures to ensure the safer use of pesticides in daily life will also be introduced.
Parliament marks 10th Anniversary of the Euro
Parliament is marking the 10th anniversary of the Euro with a special debate in the plenary session, followed by a seminar with political leaders and leading economic journalists. The euro was created in 1999 when 11 countries irrevocably locked the bilateral exchange rates of their currencies and equipped themselves with a single monetary and exchange rate policy managed by the European Central Bank created six months earlier. Greece joined them in 2001 and in 2002 euro banknotes and coins were introduced. There are now 16 Member States which have adopted the euro as their national currency. At 10am on Tuesday 13 January, Parliament’s President, Hans-Gert Pöttering , will open a formal sitting, including speeches by European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet , Eurogroup Chair Jean-Claude Juncker and Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission Joaquín Almunia .
Security features and biometrics in passports
Children under twelve should no longer have their fingerprints included on passports issued in the European Union, the EP Civil Liberties Committee says in a co-decision report. But they should have their own passports, so as to combat trafficking in children, say MEPs. Biometric passports will be introduced in the whole EU (+ Iceland, Norway and Switzerland) on the 29th June.
Transparency: EU institutions to set an example
A report by the EP Civil Liberties Committee urges the EU institutions to do more to open up their registers and documents to the public. In the light of a recent judgment by the Court of Justice, MEPs in the committee call on the Council to hold all its debates in public and on Parliament to publish more information on its Members' activities.
Vote on report on situation of fundamental rights in the European Union
Following the debate of 17 December 2008, (see link below), MEPs will vote on a report by Giusto CATANIA (GUE/NGL, IT) on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union. MEPs in the committee address fundamental rights in its various aspects, voicing recommendations on a broad range of issues like discrimination, immigration, social rights or gender equality.
President of Latvia Valdis Zatlers to address the House
The President of Latvia Valdis Zatlers will address MEPs in a formal sitting at midday on Tuesday 13 January in Strasbourg. Valdis Zatlers (born March 22, 1955) is the 7th and current president of Latvia. He won the Latvian presidential election of 31 May 2007. He became President of Latvia on 8 July 2007.
Commemorating 11 July as a day of remembrance for the victims of Srebrenica
On 11 July 1995, the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica, which was proclaimed a safe area by the UN Security Council resolution of 16 April 1993, fell to the Bosnian Serb forces led by General Ratko Mladic and under the direction of the then president of the Republika Srpska, Radovan Karadzic. The House will debate the question of commemorating 11 July as a day of remembrance for the victims of Srebrenica after hearing statements from the Council and Commission.
Deal to improve coordination on public contracts in the field of defence and security
Parliament and Council have reached an agreement on the report on public contracts in the fields of defence and security. MEPs say Member States must ensure that there is no discrimination between undertakings claiming harm in the context of a procedure for the award of a contract as a result of the distinction made by this Directive between national rules implementing Community law and other national rules.
Situation in the Horn of Africa
MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on the situation in the Horn of Africa after statements from the Council and Commission. The political situation in Somalia, the consequences of the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops and the ongoing humanitarian crisis will be discussed. The increasing acts of piracy in the Gulf of Aden and along the Somali coasts will also be raised. The EU has set up its first naval operation ("Atalanta"), to protect commercial vessels passing through the Gulf of Aden.
EU approach to Belarus
Belarus has the opportunity to be an active partner of the EU in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), provided that the country embarks on fundamental democratic and economic reforms to bring the country closer to European common values. MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on the situation in Belarus after statements from the Council and Commission.
UCITS: MEPs set to back management company passport scheme
Parliament is to debate and vote on legislation reforming the UCITS directives, aimed at making the investment fund market in the EU less fragmented and at improving efficiency. The committee inserted provisions for a "management company passport". Negotiations to reach a compromise with the Council at first-reading have been taking place. UCITS (undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities) are investment funds sold across the EU and elsewhere under a common set of EU rules for investor protection, cost transparency and meeting basic requirements on organisation, management and oversight of funds.
Public intervention reassumes "pivotal role" in rescuing banks and transport industry
Expressing concern at the unprecedented level of instability in the European and world markets, the report drafted by Donata GOTTARDI (PES, IT) points out that the crisis in strategic sectors, and especially in the fields of finance and transport, is spurring public investment in takeovers, without care being taken to limit those rescue operations to what is strictly necessary for sustaining and developing the European economy or to ensure they do not respond to national interests only.
UN Human Rights Council: "some good work but could do better", say MEPs
The draft report on the "development of the UN Human Rights Council, including the role of the EU", drafted by Laima Andrikienė (EPP-ED, LT) on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee, sees strengths and weaknesses in the UNHRC, which superseded the UN Commission on Human Rights in 2006.
Call for more economic cooperation between the EU and Western Balkans
The political integration of the Western Balkans into the EU can only take place if there is "better, more intensive regional and international economic co-operation", says the Committee on International Trade. In a report drafted by Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL), the Committee states that the EU "must show genuine commitment to the Western Balkans" if its pledge to enable these countries to accede to the EU on schedule is to be fulfilled.
Global food security: more European initiatives needed
The EP Agriculture Committee is calling for “immediate and continuous action” to ensure global food security. It believes the aid of EUR 1 billion that the EU has decided to give to developing countries should be accompanied by fresh investment in agriculture and it calls for mechanisms to be set up to ensure that sufficient global food stocks are available. In the space of two years world food prices have increased by over 80% on average while cereal stocks have fallen in 2008 to a worrying historic low of 40 days’ supply, points out a report drafted by Mairead McGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE), which was adopted unopposed with a few amendments by the Agriculture Committee.
Animal transport - MEPs to quiz Commission
Article 27 of Animal Transport Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 requires the competent authority in the Member States to ensure compliance with the legislation and to carry out non-discriminatory inspections of animals, means of transport and accompanying documents. The inspections must be performed on an adequate proportion of the animals transported each year within each Member State. Neil PARISH (EPP-ED, UK), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development ,will be asking the Commission questions on animal Transport Regulation (EC) No 1/2005: Annual reports by the Member States on enforcement.
Mediterranean diet to be part of UNESCO?
On the occasion of the Council of Ministers meeting held in Brussels on 16 July 2007, the Commission reiterated its full support for the nomination of the Mediterranean Diet as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. This nomination will be examined in 2009 by the responsible UNESCO Committee. Neil PARISH (EPP-ED, UK), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, will be asking the Commission if they are planning to set up a specific and coordinated strategy to support this nomination.
Poor implementation of directive on equal treatment for men and women in the labour market
The Committee's own-initiative report drafted by Teresa RIERA MADURELL (PES, ES) highlights problems with the implementation of Directive 2002/73/EC in Member States - a directive which was adopted to provide the EU Member States with an effective tool to enhance national legislation on equal treatment between women and men on the labour market.
Revision of the Broadcasting communication - State aid for public broadcasting
Given that public service broadcasting plays a crucial role with regard to cultural and linguistic diversity, facilitates media pluralism, provides the public with high quality programming and in general answers cultural, social and democratic needs of society, we stress that the European Parliament must be involved in the current process of revising the Broadcasting Communication. Cornelis VISSER (EPP-ED, NL), Ivo BELET (EPP-ED, BE) and Ruth HIERONYMI (EPP-ED, DE), on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, will be asking the Commission various questions on the revision of the Broadcasting Communication - State aid for public broadcasting.
Ecosystem approach to fisheries management
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report on the Commission communication "The role of the Common Fisheries Policy in implementing an ecosystem approach to marine management". According to MEPs, this initiative is a "contribution" for guaranteeing exploitation of fisheries resources in a way that will create sustainable conditions from the social, environmental and economic points of views, urging however the Commission to reconsider the present system of TACs and quotas.
Aid to Afghanistan needs to be better coordinated, says Budgetary Control Committee
In Afghanistan 90% of public money comes from international aid, illustrating the high levels of both need and aid dependency in the country. The EU is one of Afghanistan's main donors of development aid and humanitarian assistance. Between 2002 and 2007, direct Community aid accounted for 70 % (€970 m) of the total, the remaining 30% being covered by indirect aid managed by international organisations (€422 m). In spite of the "important progress" made in the allocation of aid to Afghanistan by donor countries, the cost effectiveness ratio is "well below what it should be," says the Committee on Budgetary Control. "There is a sense that the people of Afghanistan could be directly benefiting much more from the international and Community funds received."
Human rights in the world As usual the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights issues in the world, on this occasion the topics are: Iran, the case of Shirin Ebadi, Guinea and freedom of the press in Kenya.

Launch of the Czech Presidency's programme by Czech PM Mirek Topolánek
2009-01-08 - 10:59
Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek will launch the Czech Republic's six-month Presidency of the European Union on Wednesday at 9am in a debate with MEPs and Commission President José Manuel Barroso. (The Czech Republic took over from France on 1 January 2009 and Sweden takes over the presidency in the second half of 2009)
The Czech Presidency's website explains the priorities of the presidency: "The motto ‘Europe without Barriers’ has a political and historical meaning. The year 2009 will be a year of significant anniversaries – above all, the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain, and the fifth anniversary of the most extensive enlargement of the European Union – that will commemorate the successful project of the reunification of Europe.
Only an economically strong and cohesive EU without internal barriers, building on its values and roots, will be able to address complex global issues and establish its position in today’s world. Hence, the Czech Presidency’s main priority areas will be " Economy, Energy and the European Union in the World ." Presentation of the Czech Presidency's programme

MEPs to debate the situation in Gaza
2009-01-08 - 10:59
Opening the session on Monday, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will make a statement on Gaza and on Wednesday afternoon Parliament will debate the situation in Gaza and Israel. President Pöttering said "I deplore the escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip and I call on both sides to put an end to it. It was a big mistake that Hamas declared the end of the ceasefire. It strongly has to be criticised that Hamas began again the rocket attacks on Israel but the massive Israeli reaction, which killed more than 270 people and injured hundreds, is an escalation that is totally disproportionate.
A life of a Palestinian has the same value as the life of an Israeli. Such military actions do not lead to a lasting peace in the region. Killing and injuring civilians in such a dimension will only strengthen Hamas and will push the people of Gaza and the Palestinians even further towards extremism.
I call on all the parties to engage for an immediate ceasefire, to favour dialogue and to resume calm relations as brokered by Egypt. I believe that a long standing peace solution based on a two-state-solution can only be achieved through the active involvement of all parties. I strongly encourage Arab countries to make their contribution to the restoring of peace. I also exhort the future American administration and the European Union to jointly promote a comprehensive peace strategy for the Middle East, in which the European Union must play a very active role."
EU Presidency statement on the current situation in Gaza: "The Presidency of the EU is deeply concerned by the increasing number of civilian casualties and the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza. We are profoundly disturbed by the loss of civilian life at a school in Jabaliya that resulted from Israeli military action. We continue to call on both sides to immediately implement a comprehensive ceasefire to ease the suffering of civilians in both Israel and Gaza. We call on Israel to open a humanitarian corridor in Gaza and allow humanitarian organizations free access to the territory. There is a dire need in Gaza for basic supplies, including food, medicines, water and electricity. We recall the responsibility of those who, by indiscriminately firing rockets into Israel, including from the densely populated areas of Gaza, began this tragic conflict."
The Czech Presidency has been putting great emphasis on the need to solve the humanitarian situation of the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip from the very beginning – it has been in close contact with the European Commission, more specifically with the cabinet of Commissioner Louis Michel, from the first minutes of the New Year. Consequently, the Mr Schwarzenberg proposed that the European Commission should promptly mobilise €3 million, and has welcomed the announcement made by the Commission confirming the release of this sum.

European gas supplies disrupted after Russia Ukraine dispute
2009-01-08 - 10:59
On Wednesday afternoon, Parliament will debate supply of gas from Russia following statements from Council and Commission. Several European countries say their supplies of Russian gas have been cut sharply amid an energy price dispute between Moscow and Ukraine. Turkey said all its gas supplies via Ukraine had been cut. Romania reported a 75% reduction. Bulgaria, Greece and Macedonia are also seeing shortfalls. Joint statement by the Czech EU Presidency and the European Commission
Without prior warning and in clear contradiction with the reassurances given by the highest Russian and Ukrainian authorities to the European Union, gas supplies to some EU Member States have been substantially cut. This is completely unacceptable.
The Czech EU Presidency and the European Commission demand that gas supplies be immediately restored to the EU and that the two parties resume negotiations at once with a view to a definitive settlement of their bilateral commercial dispute.
The Czech Presidency and the Commission intend to continue dialogue with both parties so that they can reach an agreement immediately. Debate : 14.01.2009

Public health
Pesticides legislation: the final lap
2009-01-08 - 10:59
The EU's new legislation on pesticides could soon be in place. Next week in Strasbourg MEPs will vote on two reports endorsing the final shape of the legislation as agreed in negotiations with the Council in December. The legislation will increase the number of pesticide products available in Member States while in due course banning the use of certain dangerous chemicals in these products. Measures to ensure the safer use of pesticides in daily life will also be introduced. The two pieces of legislation have attracted much media attention, partly due to the differing standpoints of various actors (pesticide manufacturers, farmers, health professionals, environmentalists), partly due to misunderstandings over the likely impact of the legislation.
Life-cycle of pesticides
Pesticides have a three-stage life-cycle: the placing on the market of new pesticide products; the day-to-day use of pesticides; and the end-of-life or "waste" stage. The legislation submitted to Parliament for approval next week, in two reports, deals only with the first two stages, as waste is covered by other EU laws.
Speedier approval - but stricter standards - for new pesticides
The first report, on the placing of new plant protection products on the market, deals with a regulation revising an EU directive from 1991. Procedures for approving new pesticides will be overhauled with the aim of improving environmental and health protection, while boosting competition among manufacturers. The most dangerous pesticides will be phased out over a ten-year period, though some derogations will be allowed. Hiltrud Breyer (Greens/EFA, DE) is the MEP responsible for this report.
Substances approved at EU level, products at national level
Under the new regulation, a positive list of permitted active substances (the key ingredients of pesticides) will be drawn up at EU level, with the European Food Safety Authority playing a major role. New plant protection products (i.e. pesticides) will then be licensed at national level on the basis of this list.
A three-zone EU
In fact Member States will license pesticide products at national level or through mutual recognition. The EU will be divided into three zones (north, centre and south) with compulsory mutual recognition within each zone as the basic rule, the assumption being that agricultural, plant health and environmental conditions are comparable within each zone. This should smooth the path for manufacturers wishing to bring new products to market swiftly and increase the number of products available in Member States.
However, following pressure from MEPs, individual States will have complete flexibility to adopt additional conditions or restrictions on the use of new pesticides approved within their zone. They will even be able to refuse approval for pesticide products if they can adduce special environmental or agricultural circumstances.
The three zones are: North (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Sweden), Centre (Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Hungary, Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, United Kingdom) and South (Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Portugal).
Harmful substances banned
Most active substances will receive EU approval initially for 10 years, though low-risk substances would receive a 15 year approval (in both cases renewable for 15 years).
Certain highly toxic chemicals, namely those which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, will be banned unless exposure to them would in practice be negligible. The same applies to substances which are endocrine-disrupting, those which are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) and those which are very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB).
For developmental neurotoxic or immunotoxic substances, higher safety standards may be required. Substances likely to be harmful to honeybees will also be outlawed.
However, if a substance is needed to combat a serious danger to plant health, it may be approved for up to five years (with five-year renewals) even if it does not meet the above safety criteria relating to human health.
Moreover, products containing certain hazardous substances ("candidates for substitution") are to be replaced if safer alternatives are shown to exist. MEPs successfully demanded a shorter deadline for their replacement, of three years rather than five.
A gradual process
Contrary to certain fears, the new legislation will only gradually supersede existing EU law. Pesticides which can be placed on the market under current legislation will remain available until their existing authorisation expires. There will thus be no sudden or large-scale withdrawal of products from the market.
Any substances already approved under the 1991 directive will remain legal until their approval period (10 years) expires. For example, substances approved in 2006 can remain on the market until 2016. Only then must they undergo the new authorisation procedure and only at that point might they be banned. There should thus be ample time for farmers to adapt by using alternatives or non-chemical methods or for the pesticides industry to devise replacements.
How many substances will be banned?
To place matters in perspective, when the existing EU directive took effect in 1991, over 800 active substances were used in pesticides. As a result of that legislation, the number has already been whittled down by around 50% without causing major problems to users. The new regulation is expected to remove only a small number of further substances from use, namely the worst remaining ones. Estimates vary as to how many this will be, but rapporteur Hiltrud Breyer believes a study by the Swedish Chemicals Agency KEMI, which was used as a basis for the compromise with the Council, gives the most realistic estimate available, with a figure of 22 existing substances likely to be outlawed eventually.
No loophole for imports
Fears have also been voiced that food imported into the EU could evade the new rules. However, food imports are already checked by the EU for pesticide residue levels. It is not in the interest of importers to risk falling foul of such inspections.
Using pesticides in forests, farms and parks: everyday practice
The second phase in the life-cycle, the way in which pesticides are used in everyday life (e.g. in farming, forestry and parks), is not yet governed by EU law. To fill this gap, a directive on the sustainable use of pesticides has been put forward with the aim of reducing the impact of pesticides used and promoting non-chemical alternatives to pesticides. The EP report on this legislation has been drafted by Christa Klaß (EPP-ED, DE).
A key feature of the directive is Integrated Pest Management: the promotion of non-chemical pest control methods such as crop rotation, to be used wherever possible as alternatives to pesticides.
In addition, Member States must adopt National Action Plans for reducing "risks and impacts" of pesticide use on human health and the environment, including timetables and targets for use reduction. MEPs dropped their demand for a specific reduction target of 50% for chemical substances of particular concern, to help secure a deal with the Council.
Aerial crop spraying will in general be banned, albeit with exceptions subject to approval by the authorities. No spraying will be allowed in close proximity to residential areas.
Member States must take measures to protect the aquatic environment and drinking water supplies from the impact of pesticides. These will include "buffer zones" around bodies of water, "safeguard zones" for any surface and groundwater used for drinking water and protected areas along roads and railways.
Parliament and Council also agreed to minimise or prohibit pesticide use in specific areas used by the general public or by vulnerable groups, such as parks, public gardens, sports and recreation grounds, school grounds and playgrounds and in the close vicinity of healthcare facilities.
New rules are also introduced on the training of pesticide users and salespeople, on handling and storage, on information and awareness-raising and on the inspection of pesticides application equipment.
The directive must be implemented by the Member States by early 2011.
Next steps
The compromise legislative texts must still be approved by an absolute majority of MEPs - i.e. 393 votes in favour - at next week's plenary vote, as they are being adopted at second reading under the co-decision procedure. If approved by the EP, they must then be endorsed by the Council, a formality since they were agreed by the Council's negotiators.

Euro
Parliament marks 10th Anniversary of the Euro
2009-01-08 - 10:59
The euro was created in 1999 when 11 countries irrevocably locked the bilateral exchange rates of their currencies and equipped themselves with a single monetary and exchange rate policy managed by the European Central Bank created six months earlier. Greece joined them in 2001 and in 2002 euro banknotes and coins were introduced. There are now 16 Member States which have adopted the euro as their national currency. Slovenia was the first of the accession countries that joined the EU in 2004 to adopt the common currency (1 January 2007). Cyprus and Malta followed suit on 1 January 2008 and 1 January 2009 saw Slovakia become the 16th country to adopt the euro.
Parliament is marking this 10th anniversary with a special debate in the plenary session, followed by a seminar with political leaders and leading economic journalists.
Formal sitting in plenary
At 10am on Tuesday 13 January, Parliament’s President, Hans-Gert Pöttering, will open a formal sitting, including speeches by European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, Eurogroup Chair Jean-Claude Juncker and Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission Joaquín Almunia.
This will be followed by a debate, including interventions from the political groups, and the two co-rapporteurs on Parliament’s report on the first ten years of Economic and Monetary Union and future challenges – Pervenche Berès (PES, FR, Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee) and Werner Langen (EPP-ED, DE).
Colloquium on the role of the euro in managing the economic and financial crisis
At 11.30am in Room WIC 100, Parliament holds a special discussion chaired by Ms Berès, with guest speakers including Mr Almunia, former EP President José Maria Gil-Robles, Czech Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Alexandr Vondra (tbc) and a number of leading economic and financial journalists: Bernd Ziesemer of Handelsblatt , Jesus Martinez de Rioja Vasquez of Expansion , Isabelle Couet of Les Echos , Carlo Bastasin of Il Sole 24 Ore and John Thornhill of the Financial Times .

Security features and biometrics in passports
2009-01-08 - 10:59
Children under twelve should no longer have their fingerprints included on passports issued in the European Union, the EP Civil Liberties Committee says in a co-decision report. But they should have their own passports, so as to combat trafficking in children, say MEPs. Biometric passports will be introduced in the whole EU (+ Iceland, Norway and Switzerland) on the 29th June. The EP will vote on plans to amend a 2004 regulation laying down biometric features to be included in passports and other travel documents, including the holder's fingerprints. The Civil Liberties adopted unanimously the compromise reached by rapporteur Carlos COELHO (EPP, PT) with Council last year.
In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, the Commission was asked by Member States to take immediate action to improve document security. The EU decided, therefore, to integrate biometrics in European passports. These identifiers comprise a facial image and fingerprints, making it possible to combat fraud and falsification more effectively. The regulation, already adopted, which will come into force in June, establishes technical specifications such as :
• additional security features notably with a view to combating counterfeiting and falsification;
• the storage medium and its security;
• common quality requirements for the facial image and the fingerprints.
However, during pilot projects carried out in some Member States it was found that children's fingerprints are not of sufficient quality, especially those of the youngest children, which can change greatly as they grow older. In its draft text, the European Commission therefore suggested to introduce an exemption for children under twelve. A similar exemption was agreed for people deemed physically unable to give fingerprints.
The rapporteur and Council presidency agreed that fingerprints should not be taken from children under the age of 12. However, countries already taking fingerprints from children under that age, but not below 6, can continue to do so for four years .
In cases where it is impossible to take fingerprints, Member states may deliver a temporary passport having a validity of twelve months or less.
One person, one passport
To combat trafficking in children, the draft legislation also proposes introducing the principle "one person, one passport": until now a passport issued to a parent has often also covered the children by adding their names - but the microchip contains only the parent's biometric data. The Regulation does not provide a legal base for setting up or maintaining databases for storage of these data in Member States.
UK government position
The UK is excluded from participation in this Regulation as it is a development of the Schengen acquis in which the UK does not take part. However, the Government supports the inclusion of fingerprints in passports and travel documents as a means of providing better identification. The UK has stated its intention to keep in step with the Regulation to ensure that UK passports are not seen as 'second class' compared with those issued by other Member States.
Germany started collecting fingerprints in March 2007. The Netherlands are testing it since 2004. In France, it is available on request since April 2006.

Transparency: EU institutions to set an example
2009-01-08 - 10:59
A report by the EP Civil Liberties Committee urges the EU institutions to do more to open up their registers and documents to the public. In the light of a recent judgment by the Court of Justice, MEPs in the committee call on the Council to hold all its debates in public and on Parliament to publish more information on its Members' activities. The report by Marco CAPPATO (ALDE, IT) on public access to documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission was adopted unopposed in committee with one abstention.
MEPs believe that the EU and its Member States have moved towards recognising a genuine right of access to documents of the institutions and they point out that the rate of refusals to allow access is falling. However, shortcomings have emerged in the implementation of the regulation, owing to differing interpretations. They call on the institutions to take fresh measures to improve transparency, arguing that this is "a condition of their legality, their legitimacy and their accountability".
The committee stresses that the European institutions have a duty to ensure that their activities are publicised, a principle underscored by the European Court of Justice in a judgment delivered on 1 July 2008 on a case brought by former MEP Maurizio Turco. The Luxembourg-based judges took the view that opinions of the Council's legal service relating to any piece of legislation should be made public. They also set limits to the grounds for refusing access to a document.
According to MEPs in the committee, this "historic" ruling requires the Council to ensure that all its documents and information are in the public domain, including the identity of members of national delegations and working parties.
A single European information portal
In addition, the committee argued that Parliament must take the lead on transparency and should embark on a special action plan ahead of the 2009 elections, with more information on MEPs' activities, their attendance at parliamentary meetings - in absolute, relative and percentage terms - and on their allowances and expenses.
MEPs in the committee add that "accessing information relating to the EU institutions still remains an obstacle-strewn path for ordinary citizens". An inter-institutional search engine should be introduced, together with "a single EU register / portal" for information and documents. The institutions are urged to improve transparency of the procedures for comitology and for agreements thrashed out at first-reading of the co-decision procedure through "trialogues".
Transparency in MEPs own activities
The report says that Parliament should be at the forefront of publicity, transparency and openness in the EU, and that, before the 2009 Parliamentary elections, it should launch an extraordinary action plan, for instance within the framework of the e-Parliament initiative, to ensure that more and easily accessible information is made available on its website, on:
– MEPs' activities, participation in and attendance at Parliamentary work, in absolute, relative and percentage terms, available and accessible to citizens also through search criteria
– Parliament's activities in plenary, committee, delegations and internal bodies: the Legislative Observatory should be improved by including references and links to all relevant documents; committee and delegation work should be streamed on Parliament's website as plenary work is, and also recorded, and made available and accessible to citizens through search criteria; internal bodies (such as the Conference of Presidents, the Bureau, the Quaestors, the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform, etc) should promote and ensure the highest level of transparency of their work vis-a-vis other members and citizens by making all their documents available,
– MEPs' allowances and spending, in conformity with the position taken by the European Ombudsman in relation to the fact that access to information should apply also to such data, as well as all declarations of financial interests for all MEPs, and that such information should be available in all EU official languages.

Commemorating 11 July as a day of remembrance for the victims of Srebrenica
2009-01-08 - 10:59
On 11 July 1995, the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica, which was proclaimed a safe area by the UN Security Council resolution of 16 April 1993, fell to the Bosnian Serb forces led by General Ratko Mladic and under the direction of the then president of the Republika Srpska, Radovan Karadzic. The House will debate the question of commemorating 11 July as a day of remembrance for the victims of Srebrenica after hearing statements from the Council and Commission.
In 1995, Serbian forces, according to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), massacred around 8,000 Bosnian Muslims. Council and Commission statements

Fundamental rights
Vote on report on situation of fundamental rights in the European Union
2009-01-08 - 10:59
Following the debate of 17 December 2008, (see link below), MEPs will vote on a report by Giusto CATANIA (GUE/NGL, IT) on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union. MEPs in the committee address fundamental rights in its various aspects, voicing recommendations on a broad range of issues like discrimination, immigration, social rights or gender equality. Excesses in the fight against terrorism
MEPs in the committee point out that over these last few years, the fight against terrorism has often served to diminish the level of protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, notably the right to privacy, data protection and freedom from discrimination. They call on the EU and Member States to ensure full compliance with international standards in this matter.
CIA activities in Europe : Member States deaf to EPs recommendations
Concerning Parliament's report on CIA activities in the EU adopted in February 2007, MEPs in the committee stress that their recommendations have not been followed so far by Member States and EU institutions. However, they welcome the statement by US President-Elect Barack Obama on closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and bringing the inmates to trial and call on Member States to declare their readiness to jointly find solutions for remaining inmates.
Discrimination against Roma people: members oppose fingerprinting
MEPs point to the "segregation" faced by Roma people in Member States and the "widespread anti-Roma sentiments" leading to "frequent denial of their rights by public authorities and their political under-representation". Moreover, they suffer "discrimination by the police (...) inter alia by taking fingerprints or other forms of data collection", MEPs in the committee say. They call on the Member States to "take measures to put an end to the practice of unofficial marriage of minors, often at a very young age".
Same-sex couples: partnerships should be recognised
The committee calls on Member States to take legislative action to overcome discrimination experienced by same-sex couples by recognising such relationships. Member States with legislation on same-sex partnerships are invited to recognise provisions with similar effects adopted by others.
Immigration and integration: the need to avoid exclusion
"Rather than focusing all their efforts on preventing illegal immigration", which led to "deploying a growing range of frontier checks" MEPs in the committee say, EU Institutions and Member States should introduce "effective, long term and legal migration policies" and "more flexible and coordinated rules" for asylum seekers. The committee also condemns "the lack of effective integration policies", causing "the exclusion of hundreds of thousands of non-nationals", putting them "in a vulnerable position, opening the way to radicalisation, trafficking and other forms of exploitation".
Regional languages
The Civil Liberties Committee wants to promote regional or minority languages, as "the right to speak and to be educated in one's mother tongue is one of the most basic fundamental rights", MEPs say.

Deal to improve coordination on public contracts in the field of defence and security
2009-01-08 - 10:59
Parliament and Council have reached an agreement on the report on public contracts in the fields of defence and security. MEPs say Member States must ensure that there is no discrimination between undertakings claiming harm in the context of a procedure for the award of a contract as a result of the distinction made by this Directive between national rules implementing Community law and other national rules. The aim is to coordinate procedures for the award of certain public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts in the fields of defence and security. The report is drafted by Alexander Graf LAMBSDORFF (ALDE, DE).
Scope
For the purposes of the Directive, the term “military equipment” should cover products which, although initially designed for civilian use, were later adapted to military purposes to be used as arms, munitions or war material, the agreement says.
Not applicable to contracts outside the EU or intelligence related contracts
The directive shall not apply (inter-alia) to contracts governed by specific procedural rules pursuant to an international agreement or arrangement concluded (...) between one or more Member States and one or more third countries.
This Directive shall not apply to the following cases:
a) contracts for which the application of the rules of this Directive would oblige a Member State to supply information, the disclosure of which it considers contrary to the essential interests of its security; b) contracts for the purpose of intelligence activities.
Thresholds
This Directive applies to contracts which have a value excluding value-added tax (VAT) estimated to be no less than the following thresholds:
a) EUR 412,000 for supply and service contracts;
b) EUR 5 150 000 for works contracts.
Review procedure
Parliament introduces a new review procedure which sets out that Member States must take the measures necessary to ensure that decisions taken by the contracting authorities/entities may be reviewed effectively and, in particular, as rapidly as possible. Member States must ensure that there is no discrimination between undertakings claiming harm in the context of a procedure for the award of a contract as a result of the distinction made by this Directive between national rules implementing Community law and other national rules.
Entry into force
Member States shall adopt and publish, by [two years after the entry into force of the Directive] at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions. Rapporteur Alexander Graf LAMBSDORFF ALDE DE Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Situation in the Horn of Africa
2009-01-08 - 10:59
MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on the situation in the Horn of Africa after statements from the Council and Commission. The political situation in Somalia, the consequences of the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops and the ongoing humanitarian crisis will be discussed. The increasing acts of piracy in the Gulf of Aden and along the Somali coasts will also be raised. The EU has set up its first naval operation ("Atalanta"), to protect commercial vessels passing through the Gulf of Aden. Facts about Somalia
- Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central government since 1991.
- Ethiopia invaded Somalia in December 2006, following the set up of an Islamic regime by the Islamic Courts Union.
- More than 100 attacks by Somali pirates in the waterway were recorded in 2008.
Facts about Atalanta
The military operation, called EU NAVFOR Somalia (operation "Atalanta"), is conducted in support of UN Security Council Resolutions 1814 (2008), 1816 (2008), 1838 (2008), 1846 (2008) and 1851 (2008) in order to contribute to:
- the protection of vessels of the WFP (World Food Programme) delivering food aid to displaced persons in Somalia;
- the protection of vulnerable vessels cruising off the Somali coast, and the deterrence, prevention and repression of acts of piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast.
It is commanded by Rear Admiral Phillip Jones (UK). Commodore Antonios Papaioannou (GR) is the EU Force Commander.
Operation EU NAVFOR reached its Initial Operational Capability on 13 December 2008.
A Delegation of MEPs to the Horn of Africa
A Delegation of MEPs, members of the Development Committee, travelled to the Horn of Africa (Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Djibouti) from 25 October to 2 November 2008.
The delegation focused on food security following the global food crisis caused by soaring prices and peaceful solutions to border conflicts. Good governance in the region and human rights situation was also examined.
The delegation had an exchange of views about the "EU regional political partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa", an initiative on which the Development Committee adopted a report in April 2007.
MEPs also discussed the implementation of the Algiers peace agreement that ended the border war (1998 – 2000) between Eritrea and Ethiopia. The Security Council decided not to renew the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE)'s mandate beyond 31 July 2008.
MEPs met, among others parliamentarians, representatives of Governments, of international organisations and of civil society and non-governmental organisations.
The delegation was led by Alain Hutchinson (PES, BE) and composed of Filip Kacmarek (PPE-DE, PL) and Mikel Irujo Amezaga (Greens/EFA, ES). Debate : 14.01.2009 European Parliament resolution of 23 October 2008 on piracy at sea European Parliament resolution of 20 November 2008 on Somalia

EU approach to Belarus
2009-01-08 - 10:59
Belarus has the opportunity to be an active partner of the EU in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), provided that the country embarks on fundamental democratic and economic reforms to bring the country closer to European common values. MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on the situation in Belarus after statements from the Council and Commission.
The EU's offer to re-engage with Belarus was set out in the document What the EU could bring to Belarus, which the Commission released in November 2006 and which offers Belarus to enter a full partnership, as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, provided that Belarus takes convincing steps towards democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law. It contains concrete examples of how the people of Belarus could gain from a rapprochement between the EU and Belarus.
In October 2008, the European Parliament Conference of Presidents called on the authorities of Belarus to lift their entry ban on EU politicians. The leaders of the European Parliament's political groups demanded that Belarus reciprocate the Council's decision to lift travel restrictions imposed on certain leading Belarusian politicians for a trial period of six months.

UCITS: MEPs set to back management company passport scheme
2009-01-08 - 10:59
Parliament is to debate and vote on legislation reforming the UCITS directives, aimed at making the investment fund market in the EU less fragmented and at improving efficiency. The committee inserted provisions for a "management company passport". Negotiations to reach a compromise with the Council at first-reading have been taking place. UCITS (undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities) are investment funds sold across the EU and elsewhere under a common set of EU rules for investor protection, cost transparency and meeting basic requirements on organisation, management and oversight of funds.
The investment fund can invest in shares, bonds, other investment funds, bank accounts or index tracking funds, for instance. They enable individuals to invest in a diversified portfolio without having to manage all the details themselves or to have a large amount of money available to start with.
The EU framework for these investment funds, originally set up in 1985 and updated several times since then, was intended to allow a real single market in investment funds to develop – since UCITS funds all complied with the same rules, consumers could invest with confidence across EU borders.
A large market, but barriers to integration remain
The products have been a success: at the end of 2006 they accounted for over €6.4 trillion of assets in total which is equivalent to half of the Union's GDP and represents 11.5% of European household financial assets.
Too often, however, different national interpretations of the rules have impeded cross-border sales of UCITS products. The Commission is now proposing:
• to remove administrative barriers to cross-border distribution of UCITS funds;
• to create a framework for mergers between UCITS funds and allow the use of "master-feeder" structures;
• to replace the "Simplified Prospectus" with a short "Key Investor Information" document
• to improve cooperation mechanisms between national supervisors.
Management Company Passport now included
The basis of the last point is a "management company passport" allowing funds authorised in one Member State to be managed remotely by a management companies established in another Member State. Concerns were raised about risks in this approach to the "gold standard" of investor protection which the UCITS brand represents, and this widening of the passport approach was not included in the Commission's original proposal pending a further consultation by the Committee of European Securities Regulators, which has since been completed.
In adopting a report drawn up by Wolf KLINZ (ALDE, DE), MEPs in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee adopted a wide range of amendments to improve the rules, while welcoming the general approach. In particular, they adopted amendments to incorporate the new Management Company Passport system into the UCITS rules, having been satisfied that it was possible to open up the single market in investment products while at the same time maintaining the level of protection for retail investors.
Aiming for a first reading deal with Council
Since the committee vote in December, discussions have been underway with Council representatives with a view to reaching a first-reading compromise which would allow the proposal to become law shortly after the plenary vote at the January session.

Public intervention reassumes "pivotal role" in rescuing banks and transport industry
2009-01-08 - 10:59
In response to the difficult economic and financial situation currently affecting Europe and the world, public sector intervention is reassuming a "pivotal role, sometimes taking the form of outright nationalisation," says the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Expressing concern at the unprecedented level of instability in the European and world markets, the report drafted by Donata GOTTARDI (PES, IT) points out that the crisis in strategic sectors, and especially in the fields of finance and transport, is spurring public investment in takeovers, without care being taken to limit those rescue operations to what is strictly necessary for sustaining and developing the European economy or to ensure they do not respond to national interests only.
Appropriate supervision and sharing the tax burden
The report stresses that it is in the interests of the public, the taxpayer and public budgets to ensure that every intervention and use of public funds for rescuing financial organisations is accompanied by appropriate supervision, concrete improvements in the governance and business conduct of the enterprise or institution, precise limits on the amounts paid to executives and clear accountability vis‑à‑vis the public authorities.
The committee also believes that rescue packages from the wholesale public sector will have repercussions for public finances and personal incomes, making it necessary for the tax burden to be suitably and equitably spread among all taxpayers. This would entail, on the one hand, the imposition of an appropriate level of taxation on all financial players and on the other, provision for a gradual and sharp reduction in the tax burden on mid to low‑level salaries and pensions.
Bring wage increases in line with inflation
There needs to be a common approach on wage policies, which provides for wage increases in line with actual inflation and productivity, says the report, "since fiscal and wage policies are powerful and effective levers on demand and for economic stability and growth".

The report "on the development of the UN Human Rights Council, including the role of the EU", drafted by Laima Andrikienė (EPP-ED, LT) on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee, sees strengths and weaknesses in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) which superseded the UN Commission on Human Rights in 2006. In a draft report, MEPs welcome the work carried out by the UN Human Rights Council in its first two years of existence but regretted that it had not yet achieved more in improving the UN's human rights record. The EU should seek to play a more prominent role in promoting a clear vision, political agenda and long-term strategy for the UN body, say MEPs.
MEPs in the committee argue that "the UNHRC has the potential to develop into a valuable framework for the European Union's multilateral human rights efforts". However, various challenges are identified. The USA's absence from the UNHRC has left the EU with a greater burden of responsibility but the EU Member States are often outvoted by the African and Asian regional groups. A key concern is that "the principle of the universality of human rights is being increasingly undermined, as illustrated in particular by the attempts on the part of certain countries to introduce limits to well-recognised human rights, such as freedom of expression, or to interpret human rights against a cultural or traditional background".
MEPs condemn undermining of procedures to hide inconvenient truths
The report recognises the value the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, which in principle subjects all UN states to equal scrutiny of their human rights practices but it "denounces the use of political alliances to shield certain States from scrutiny".
Special Procedures are a more targeted instrument designed to look at individual country situations. The report stresses that "the credibility and effectiveness of the UNHRC in the protection of human rights rests on cooperation with Special Procedures and their full implementation" and "condemns the efforts made by several UNHRC Members to limit the independence and efficiency" of these procedures.
The report also highlights the importance of civil society organisations in the work of the UNHRC. It urges the EU Member States to facilitate their work and calls on donors to aid human rights organisations which cannot afford a base in Geneva. MEPs also voice strong backing for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and for its efforts "to strengthen its presence on the ground through the opening of regional offices".
EU must take a stronger lead
As to the EU's role in the UNHRC, the report points to successes, such as the EU's call for special sessions on Darfur and Myanmar but regrets "the rather defensive attitude adopted by the EU in the UNHRC, in particular its reluctance to put forward resolutions on country situations, as these usually meet with intense resistance from other countries".
The EU and its Member States are urged to make better use of their potential as the leader of a group of democratic countries with solid human rights records. The resolutions adopted on a moratorium on the death penalty and on the right to water are seen as examples of how such leadership can achieve results.
The report calls on the EU to further develop the practice put forward during the Slovenian presidency of "outreach" towards other UNHRC members and "burden-sharing" between EU Member States. It also welcomes the trend whereby EU Member States intervene in the debates in addition to the EU Presidency, thereby helping "to reinforce the EU’s message by putting across 'one message, but with many voices' ".
Speaking after the vote in committee, rapporteur Laima Andrikienė said "the EU has been a strong supporter and advocate of the establishment of the UNHRC, which is a testing ground of the EU's commitment to effective multilateralism." She highlighted the report's conclusion that "the EU must have a clear vision, political agenda and long-term strategy as regards the functioning of the UNHRC as well as the actions by EU Member States within the Council".

Budgetary control
Aid to Afghanistan needs to be better coordinated, says Budgetary Control Committee
2009-01-08 - 10:59
In spite of the "important progress" made in the allocation of aid to Afghanistan by donor countries, the cost effectiveness ratio is "well below what it should be," says the Committee on Budgetary Control. "There is a sense that the people of Afghanistan could be directly benefiting much more from the international and Community funds received." In Afghanistan 90 % of public money comes from international aid, illustrating the high levels of both need and aid dependency in the country. The EU is one of Afghanistan's main donors of development aid and humanitarian assistance. Between 2002 and 2007, direct Community aid accounted for 70 % (€970 m) of the total, the remaining 30% being covered by indirect aid managed by international organisations (€422 m).
Since the signing of the Pact for Afghanistan in early 2006, important progress has been made in the allocation of aid by donor countries, making it possible to reduce duplication of expenditure and cut corruption. Key advances made include those registered in health, education and infrastructure (especially roads).
Lack of coordination and fraud
In spite of these advances, MEPs highlight the "lack of coordination "between donor countries at international level. The Committee insists that the Commission "tackle the worrying coordination shortcomings regarding EU financial assistance to Afghanistan not only between Member States and it but also amongst Member States".
The committee report stresses the need for stronger monitoring of the implementation of EU development cooperation, and calls for the UN and other international organisations which manage EU funds to cooperate fully with the ECA and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), as well as with the UN Joint Inspection Unit.
Drawing attention to Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999, Parliament insists that all information on cases of fraud or severe irregularities having an impact on EU funds be forwarded as a matter of urgency to OLAF.
Publicising EU activities and other measures
MEPs regret the near-total absence of support from the Member States for its project identification efforts, and consider it essential to boost the visibility of the Union's actions both locally and in the eyes of the European public.
Looking to the future, Parliament believes that further efforts are required as regards international assistance in order to support implementation of the Afghan national development strategy and phase-in improved coordination and more efficient methods in the activation of the development priorities as defined by the Afghans themselves.
The committee report also encourages the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, to "intervene more forcefully in order to tackle the key problems affecting daily life, health, security and access to public services and basic education".

External/international trade
Call for more economic cooperation between the EU and Western Balkans
2009-01-08 - 10:59
The political integration of the Western Balkans into the EU can only take place if there is "better, more intensive regional and international economic co-operation", says the Committee on International Trade. In a report drafted by Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL), the Committee states that the EU "must show genuine commitment to the Western Balkans" if its pledge to enable these countries to accede to the EU on schedule is to be fulfilled. "A serious prospect of EU membership for the Western Balkan states can act as a catalyst to encourage their population and governments to move away from regressive nationalism, sectarian violence and towards a future of integration with the rest of Europe," the report says.
"The EU has set aside almost €8 billion in support of the 2007-2010 period, but without appropriate co-operation and without creating a sense that everyone is working together towards a common goal, the hoped-for results will not be achieved," it adds.
Call for deeper integration into world trade system
The International Trade Committee calls on the Commission and the Council to implement all appropriate measures encouraging deeper integration of the Western Balkans into the world trade and economic system, "in particular through WTO accession for countries in the region which are not yet members".
The committee report also recognises that the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) contributes significantly to the preparation of the Western Balkan countries’ accession to the European Union.
Commission and Member States to provide additional financial resources
In terms of funding, the report urges the Commission and the Member States to endow the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) with the additional financial resources needed to develop projects tailored to real needs and to provide effective and focused assistance at local and regional levels.
It also calls on the Council and the Commission to supply the states in the region with economic and administrative technical assistance by duly qualified persons, in cooperation with the international and regional organisations dealing with Western Balkan economic issues, in order to strengthen local public structures, establish a more efficient and diversified economic base and improve the penetration of local products into foreign markets, and into the European Union in particular.
Structural Funds and better financing for SME-related projects
The Commission and the Western Balkan countries should make sufficient financial resources available for infrastructure modernisation, says the report, and the Commission and the Member States should ensure that SMEs have access to EU Structural Funds and to provide better financing for SME-related projects.
It stresses, however, that further financial assistance to the Western Balkans (and notably to Kosovo) should be conditional on the establishment, with the support of international financial institutions, of a comprehensive and realistic long-term economic development plan and calls on the Commission to set up an institutional framework to enhance cooperation between the Community and the private sector in the countries of the Western Balkans which will ensure the appropriate use of Community funds.
Continuation of the Stabilisation and Association Process
The committee calls on the Commission to monitor developments and, if necessary, to adopt adequate measures in order to guarantee the smooth continuation of the Stabilisation and Association Process, which in its view "is an important factor for stability in the region and in the best interests of the EU itself".
In light of this, it urges Member States to conclude the ratification process for all the Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) as soon as possible. Rapporteur Bastiaan BELDER IND/DEM NL Procedure : own-initiative

Agriculture
Global food security: more European initiatives needed
2009-01-08 - 10:59
The EP Agriculture Committee is calling for “immediate and continuous action” to ensure global food security. It believes the aid of EUR 1 billion that the EU has decided to give to developing countries should be accompanied by fresh investment in agriculture and it calls for mechanisms to be set up to ensure that sufficient global food stocks are available. In the space of two years world food prices have increased by over 80% on average while cereal stocks have fallen in 2008 to a worrying historic low of 40 days’ supply, points out a report drafted by Mairead McGuinness (EPP-ED, IE), which was adopted unopposed with a few amendments by the Agriculture Committee. According to the World Bank, over 860 million people in the world are facing chronic famine and this figure could rise by 100 million as a result of the current crisis. Commodity prices have fallen back to near-2006 levels but the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) fear they may fluctuate more, and global food demand is expected to double by 2050.
Ensuring adequate global stocks
Among the many measures proposed in the report, the Agriculture Committee calls for the introduction of instruments to avert dramatic and damaging price fluctuations.
It argues that the EU should take the initiative by proposing a global food inventory regime, the creation of a worldwide stockholding obligation programme to ensure the availability of food and a better basic storage system for key production inputs (protein, fertilisers, seeds, pesticides) in developing countries, preferably based on private-sector players including farmers’ cooperatives.
MEPs in the committee also call for a global assessment of the impact of the increase in biofuel production on commodity prices. They stress the need for international and regional agreements to ensure that energy crops do not jeopardise food security and they urge a firm commitment from the EU to give priority to second-generation biofuels which do not compete with food production.
Redirecting EU development towards agriculture
The Agriculture Committee regrets the reduction in the amount of development aid being devoted to agriculture, which was 17% in 1980 and only 3% in 2006, and urges the Commission to direct EU financial aid – including the European Development Fund (EDF) - towards agricultural-led growth and to do all in its power to induce governments of beneficiary countries to stick to their promise to devote 10% of national budgets to this sector. They also want new micro-credit facilities to be set up for small farmers, stressing the role such farmers can play in increasing production and in local food security.
To complement the other development measures funded by the EU, the committee calls for a permanent food-security fund be created in support of the world's poorest people, under Heading 4 of the EU general budget.
CAP, climate change, financial crisis and European research
The committee believes the common agricultural policy (CAP) must remain the cornerstone of EU food security policy now and beyond 2013 and that it should be further adapted to go further than the measures contained in the Health Check. It also calls for EU agriculture spending to be kept at a stable and constant level to guarantee a fair income for farmers and for effective insurance policies to be made available to protect producers against massive price fluctuations.
MEPs in the committee urge the Commission to look at the impact of climate change mitigation initiatives in the agriculture sector and to provide resources for this sector so that such initiatives do not depress EU farm output.
They also call for a detailed assessment of the impact on food security of proposed EU legislation on plant protection products and an analysis of the effects of the global financial crisis on the agricultural sector.
Lastly, the committee calls for a programme of research and development on sustainable agriculture. Rapporteur Mairead MCGUINNESS EPP-ED IE A6-0505/2008 Common Agricultural Policy and Global Food Security Procedure : own-initiative

Animal transport - MEPs to quiz Commission
2009-01-08 - 10:59
Neil PARISH (EPP-ED, UK), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development ,will be asking the Commission questions on animal Transport Regulation (EC) No 1/2005: Annual reports by the Member States on enforcement. Article 27 of Animal Transport Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 requires the competent authority in the Member States to ensure compliance with the legislation and to carry out non-discriminatory inspections of animals, means of transport and accompanying documents. The inspections must be performed on an adequate proportion of the animals transported each year within each Member State.
Member States are also required to submit to the Commission by 30 June each year an annual report on the state of enforcement to be accompanied by an analysis of the major deficiencies detected and an action plan to address them.
The Animal Transport Regulation is in force since January 2007. The Commission should, therefore, have received the first annual reports from the Member States on the enforcement of the Regulation.
Can the Commission state which Member States have forwarded their report?
Has the Commission already carried out a preliminary analysis of the reports which would allow giving some statements on the shortcomings and difficulties but also on the major achievements in the enforcement of the legislation?
Will the Commission consequently prepare a report on the Regulation's enforcement process in the Member States? Such an analysis will be essential in the context of the planned revision of the Animal Transport Regulation.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Poor implementation of directive on equal treatment for men and women in the labour market
2009-01-08 - 10:59
Slow or low quality implementation of a European Parliament and Council directive on equal treatment for men and women in the workplace "risks endangering the Lisbon strategy and the possibility to develop the full potential of the EU social and economic capacity", says the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. The Committee's own-initiative report drafted by Teresa RIERA MADURELL (PES, ES) highlights problems with the implementation of Directive 2002/73/EC in Member States - a directive which was adopted to provide the EU Member States with an effective tool to enhance national legislation on equal treatment between women and men on the labour market.
A definition of "sexual harassment" was set out for the first time at EU level in Directive 2002/73/EC. The directive also defines direct and indirect discrimination, and discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy or maternity leave.
Problems with implementation
The report states that at the end of the deadline for transposition of the directive (5 October 2005), nine Member States had not notified measures to transpose the directive. Consequently the Commission launched infringement proceedings against all those Member States which resulted in two procedures on non-communication against Belgium and Luxemburg.
Parliament regrets that the Commission's report to the European Parliament and the Council, to be based on information communicated by the Member States by the end of 2005, is not yet available.
Loopholes - definitions, scope and equality bodies
The definitions of discrimination has "in one way or another been incorrectly transposed in 15 Member States" the report says. MEPs deplore the fact that legislation in several Member States does not include in a sufficiently clear and explicit manner definitions of direct and indirect discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment.
The scope of the directive has not been properly implemented in 18 Member States, the most common being the non-coverage of self-employed activities and affiliation and involvement in workers or employers associations.
Article 8a of the directive requires the designation of an equality body. The report finds that there are "important differences in how these equality bodies operate" in each Member State. "The degree of competences vested on the equality bodies varies greatly among Member States encompassing the mere extra-judicial assistance, the power of mediation, the right to investigate ex-officio and the power of intervening in judicial matters."

Revision of the Broadcasting communication - State aid for public broadcasting
2009-01-08 - 10:59
Given that public service broadcasting plays a crucial role with regard to cultural and linguistic diversity, facilitates media pluralism, provides the public with high quality programming and in general answers cultural, social and democratic needs of society, we stress that the European Parliament must be involved in the current process of revising the Broadcasting Communication. Cornelis VISSER (EPP-ED, NL), Ivo BELET (EPP-ED, BE) and Ruth HIERONYMI (EPP-ED, DE), on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, will be asking the Commission questions on the revision of the Broadcasting Communication - State aid for public broadcasting.
According to the Competition Commissioner, Mrs Neelie KROES , the 2001 Broadcasting Communication guarantees valuable guidance to media companies, public broadcasters and Member States. However, she considers that there may be ways it can be usefully improved in order to increase transparency and legal certainty.
In her speech to the Strasbourg broadcasting seminar (Strasbourg, 17 July 2008) Mrs Kroes defined the guidelines for the revision of the Broadcasting Communication:
– better assessment of market impact of State aid in the new media
– introducing more effective control mechanisms in the new media environment
– better definition for the public mission of broadcasters where they enter new media markets
1. How concretely will the Commission involve Parliament in the revision of the Broadcasting Communication?
2. Is the ex ante assessment requirement compatible with the Commission's competences under the EU Treaty and, in particular, the Amsterdam Protocol and Community law regarding services of general interest?
3. Does ex ante assessment place an unnecessary administrative and financial burden on Member States and public service broadcasters?
4. Is it in the public interest to take into account the existing market offers and interests of the commercial media while defining the scope of the remit and activities of public service broadcasters?
5. What are the next steps in the revision of the Broadcasting Communication? When can Parliament expect a first draft version of the Communication? Debate : 12.01.2009

Fisheries
Ecosystem approach to fisheries management
2009-01-08 - 10:59
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report on the Commission communication "The role of the Common Fisheries Policy in implementing an ecosystem approach to marine management". According to MEPs, this initiative is a "contribution" for guaranteeing exploitation of fisheries resources in a way that will create sustainable conditions from the social, environmental and economic points of views, urging however the Commission to reconsider the present system of TACs and quotas. The EP Fisheries Committee urges the Commission to reconsider the present system of total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas as the principal instrument for managing marine resources and its "usefulness" given the present fishing restrictions.
In a report drawn up by Pedro GUERREIRO (GUE/NGL, PT), MEPs recognise that the existing fisheries management instruments, based on TACs, have a direct impact on catches and an indirect impact on fishing effort, adding, however, that "management of fishing effort is needed". They urge the Commission to study the different instruments for managing marine resources, "ensuring that the existing instruments will not be changed until an alternative that ensures a more adequate exploitation of fisheries resources has come up".
The committee considers it "insufficient to measure fishing effort in a uniform way", without taking account of the diversity of fleets and gear. "Controlling fishing effort should take account of the various species, the various fishing gear and the assessed impact of catches on stocks of each species", states the report.
According to MEPs in the committee, one of the first tasks to be carried out in the area of fisheries management is to assess scientifically whether there are any over-large fleets and over-exploited resources, and which they are, so that suitable specific measures can be adopted.
Fisheries management measures - such as technical modifications to nets, the closure of certain areas and the reduction of fishing effort - should be "diversified, specific and adapted to each case".
Southern Hake and Norway Lobster off the Iberian Peninsula
The Fisheries Committee proposes that scientific studies be carried out capable of identifying the redistribution of marine species exploited by fisheries because of the impact of the recent change in the physical and chemical parameters of waters due to climatic change. According to MEPs, these studies should serve as a basis for reformulating a number of existing stock recovery plans, for example the recovery plan for Southern Hake and Norway Lobster off the Iberian Peninsula.
The committee also stresses the need to apply mechanisms to subsidise or compensate fishermen affected by the economic and social repercussions of multiannual recovery and management plans and measures to protect ecosystems.
12 miles: derogation should be "permanent"
The committee expresses its deep concern at the possibility of any change being made to the common fisheries policy (CFP) that promotes the concentration of fishing activity, in particular as regards the right of access to resources, and considers it vital to maintain the access derogation to the zone falling within territorial waters at least 12 miles, calling for this derogation to be "permanent in nature".
MEPs urge the Commission to study and propose more open control and supervision systems in respect of fisheries landings, illegal catches and the discarding at sea of by-catches. In order to maintain fish stocks worldwide, "upper limits must also be set on the number of days fishermen may remain at sea", they add.
The report urges greater decentralisation of the CFP, which will guarantee the involvement of fishermen, their representative organisations and fishing communities in the CFP and fisheries management.
