The EU has 77,000 km of coast
Tuesday saw three EU presidents launch the first European Maritime Day. The ceremony came after a wide-ranging debate in the House on European maritime policy. In the course of a varied day, MEPs also discussed employment, a long-running scam, combating discrimination, road transport and, in a debate held against the background of recent shocking events in Naples, the situation of Roma in Europe.
Combating discrimination
In the morning, the House discussed a report on the progress made in equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the EU. Rapporteur British Liberal Liz Lynne called for a comprehensive anti-discrimination directive to combat any discrimination on grounds of disability, age, religion or belief and sexual orientation. The report also demands effective sanctions and support for victims, in particular in seeking legal redress.
Not all members concurred with the comprehensive approach sought by Ms Lynne, but ultimately it was endorsed by the House as a whole. (See our interview with Ms Lynne and detailed report on the vote).
Guidelines for employment policies
MEPs also debated and adopted a report by Belgian Socialist Anne Van Lancker <Titre> on guidelines for the employment policies in the European Union. The rapporteur stressed the need for more security for workers, better jobs and equal opportunities.
Her report states that it is extremely important to fight against discrimination, to promote access to employment for women as well as integration of migrants and minorities.
Roma - a better deal
In an animated debate, added to the agenda on Monday, MEPs also discussed the situation of the Roma. Passions ran high as attention focused on Italy, following recent attacks on a Roma camp in the Naples area.
MEPs called on EU members to enforce respect for fundamental rights and to facilitate the inclusion of the Roma in society. Europe's Social Affairs Commissioner Vladimír Špidla said “it is the very meaning of European Union to overcome racist hatred, pogroms and destruction by fire". A Roma camp in Naples was attacked this week by locals incensed by the alleged attempt by a Roma girl to kidnap a baby.
European Maritime Day is launched
On the first European Maritime Day, the European Parliament adopted a report by German Socialist Willi Piecyk on an integrated maritime policy aimed at answering the new challenges of climate change, international piracy and better protection of workers.
European Maritme Day was officially launched by Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering , Council President Janez Janša and Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
Question on a pan-European listing “scam”
Internal Market Committee chair Arlene McCarthy asked the Council what it would do to prevent sharp practices by 'Directory companies', such as 'European City Guides', who extract money from small businesses across the continent for unsolicited directory listings.
Members across the House cited mailbags overflowing with letters from constituents on this subject and demanded action.
Transport
In a debate on three proposals aimed at modernising the rules on the road transport market, the question of whether to undo some former regulation was posed. Emblematic was the so called 12 day rule for international coach trips. This envisages the reintroduction of the rule for round trips by coach, whereby drivers are permitted to work for a period of 12 consecutive days, making feasible long international travel for tourists with lower incomes.
