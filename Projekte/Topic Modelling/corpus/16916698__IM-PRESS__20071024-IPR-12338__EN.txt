Business registers for statistical purposes

MEPs approved at second reading a proposal to update the regulation on statistics on the characteristics of businesses operating in the EU - their number, size, structure and so on. The only remaining point at issue with the Council has now been resolved, so the draft regulation should become law at this stage of the procedure.
The update was needed to take account of changes in the business world in the light of ongoing globalisation and the further development of the internal market. At the first reading stage in June 2006, Parliament adopted a number of amendments, mostly aimed at reducing the administrative burden on businesses from the collection of data for statistics. All of these were accepted by the Council, but the reform of provisions to do with the Commission’s implementing powers under EU legislation (so-called “comitology”) led to a disagreement about the breadth of these powers in this case. The rapporteur, Hans-Peter Martin (NA, AT), and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee proposed to remove the “purpose” and “scope” of the transmission of data from the area covered by the implementing powers since these are better left for primary legislation. The plenary session has now backed these amendments.
The Council has indicated it can accept this change, so the proposal should become law shortly.
