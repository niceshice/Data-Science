Andrew BOREHAM BXL (+32) 2 28 42319 STR (+33) 3 881 74005 PORT (+32) 498 98 34 01 EMAIL press-en@europarl.europa.eu The recent callous and cowardly murder of three soldiers, three children and a teacher in Montauban and Toulouse must strengthen Parliament's resolve to uphold the values of mutual respect and tolerance, said its President Schulz, opening the Brussels mini-session.
"Rarely have I experienced such a repellent act" said Mr Schulz, voicing MEPs' sympathy with the victims' parents and siblings, and condemning "gruesome and cowardly murderers" who take the lives of innocent children in order to propagate their "crazy views".
Together with the city of Toulouse and its Jewish and Islamic communities, "we are all called upon to stand by the values of mutual respect and tolerance. There are no political divisions on this point. These values are the foundation of the civilised world", he added.
Mr Schulz next welcomed Turkish journalist Ahmat Şık, just released from a year's detention. To MEPs' applause, he reiterated Parliament's concern at long pre-trial detentions.
Finally, he welcomed a delegation from the United Republic of Tanzania on an official visit.
