Food at school ©BELGA Problems with co-financing affect school fruit scheme MEPs call for improvements Though the EU's School Fruit Scheme project initially gained support, in the first 2009-2010 year only €33 million of €90 million allocated was spent. With 22 million overweight children in the EU, the fruit scheme was a measure to encourage healthy lifestyle and eating habits from an earlier age. Lars Hoelgaard, one of the European Commission's top men in their Agriculture department was in the Agriculture Committee last Monday (28 Feb) to explain the first year went and discuss improvements.
Not only fruit, but lifestyle
Mr Hoelgaard pointed out the importance of the School Fruit Scheme, saying that it had many indubitable benefits, namely making sure European children eat more fruit daily, but also long-term investment in encouraging good eating habits that would continue when they are adults. It also has multiplying effect: increase the consumption not just amongst children itself but also among their parents, their siblings and teachers.
But in the first year (2009-2010) instead of the €90 million foreseen only around €33 million were spent. Some of the member states decided to stay out of the project, mostly because of co-financing, having difficulty in finding resources. In Germany for example, 16 Länder (regions) were interested in the programme but only 7 choose to participate because of co-financing. But another important problem, admitted Lars Hoelgaard, were administrative burdens imposed by the Member States linked to applications, implementation and control.
He said there was a need to find a balance between implementing a very useful programme, but in the same time to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent in a correct way and he assured MEPs that currently the administrative part is already simplified.
Make programme work, say MEPs
Italian MEP Giovanni La Via (EPP) pointed out the importance of the programme to fight obesity but understood the problems like co-financing. He criticised major delays in implementing the project, namely for being late in establishing the expert group (supposed to start to work in 2009), setting up the website, or organising the annual meetings. "Explain why a programme like this that surely can have great usefulness from the health point of view, has not really got off the ground?" he asked the meeting.
German MEP Elisabeth Jeggle (EPP) said this reminded her of similar problems linked to the implementation of the school milk programme. "I think our task is to ensure that the programmes are structured in such a way to ensure it obtains good acceptance back at home. I have heard only good things about the school fruit programme. Clearly there are still management problems. Things can be improved, but the input has to be provided from the local participants. If Commission could simplify bureaucracy and reduce the administrative burdens for this programme, I think that would pave a way for a successful programme," she said.
