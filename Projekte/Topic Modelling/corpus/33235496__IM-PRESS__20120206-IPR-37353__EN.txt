The committee approved Mr Tomé Muguruza's candidature after the Spanish authorities withdrew their original candidate, Mr Juan-Francisco Corona Ramón.
The committee vote took place after a hearing with Mr Tomé Muguruza, who had completed a written questionnaire beforehand.
Parliament as a whole will vote on the nomination at its plenary session in Strasbourg on Tuesday 14 February. If it endorses Mr Tomé Muguruza's nomination, he will take up his duties on 1 March.
It is the Council of Ministers that formally decides on appointments to the Court of Auditors, after consulting Parliament. Co-operation with Parliament, and particularly its Budgetary Control Committee, is crucial for members of the Court of Auditors.
Committee vote: 15 in favour, 11 against and 3 abstentions.
In the chair : Michael THEURER (ALDE, DE)
