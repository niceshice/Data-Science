Following the speech of the Romanian President to the House, Parliament held one minute of silence in respect of the murdered Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. MEPs also voted on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents setting out the new composition of parliamentary committees, details are set out below.
Minute of silence for murdered Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink
President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert POETTERING referred to the "appalling assassination" of Turkish-Armenian journalist HRANT DINK on 19 January. Mr Dink had called for the recognition of the historic joint past of the Turkish and Armenian peoples. Mr Dink, said President Poettering, had many enemies in Turkey and the President welcomed the Turkish government's commitment to catch and prosecute the perpetrator/s of the crime. It would seem, he said, that the motive of the accused was ultra-nationalism and a contempt for other peoples. President Poettering stated that both Joost LAGENDIJK (Greens/EFA, NL) Chair of the European Parliament - Turkey Delegation and Hélène FLAUTRE (Greens/EFA, FR), Chair of the Parliament's Sub-Committee on Human Rights had attended Mr Dink's funeral.
New composition of parliamentary committees
At the midway point of each parliamentary term, the composition of the twenty Parliamentary Committees and two sub-Committees can change. Parliament adopted the new composition which was based on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents.
The constitutive meetings of the Parliamentary Committees (30 minutes each) take place on the evening of 31 January and the morning of 1 February when the new Chairs and four Vice-Chairs of each committee will be elected. Following these meetings, Parliament's Press Service will be publishing a list of the new Chairs and Vice-Chairs on Wednesday and Thursday.
