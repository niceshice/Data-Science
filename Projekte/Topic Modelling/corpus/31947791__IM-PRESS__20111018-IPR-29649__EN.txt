Marcin Grajewski Press Team Leader +32 498 98 15 50 Following the news of the end of the detention of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, the President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzek made the following statement.
"We have been waiting for this news for too long. I am glad to hear about Gilad's peaceful and mutually agreed release.
During his 5 years in captivity the European Parliament, and European citizens, have never forgotten Shalit's plight and have been using every occasion to call for his immediate release. Galid's case was felt even more strongly as he is both an Israeli and a European citizen.
I have myself personally supported Gilad's release. I have met his father in Strasbourg in 2010 and have used every official opportunity during my official visit to the Middle East to show sympathy and support for his case.
Only last week, I have opened together with Reuven Rivlin, Speaker of the Knesset, an exhibition in the European Parliament to remember Gilad's case. Only twenty-four hours after the exhibition, the news came of the agreement to release Gilad Shalit.
It was an exhibition of illustrations to a story which Gilad wrote when he was a young boy. It was not only an opportunity for Members of the European Parliament to show that we did not forget Gilad, and reiterate the call for his release; the story was also a reminder that goodwill can overcome even the deepest differences and prejudices.
Gilad's personal story is a testimony to the idea that we must not lose faith in the pursuit of reconciliation, even if this requires some hard compromises and negotiations.
As we rejoice that Gilad Shalit is back with his family and beloved ones, we see yet another proof that 2011 is truly an annus mirabilis ."
