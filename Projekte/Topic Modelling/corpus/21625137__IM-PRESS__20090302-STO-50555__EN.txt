However, only one in ten thought quotas a good idea. The results of the latest Eurobarometer poll were presented at a seminar in the European Parliament on Wednesday.
We want your views on this issue! How can we increase the role of women in politics? Should there be national quotas for men and women candidates and what issues should the European Parliament be championing for women? Use the link below and scroll down to the end to comment.
More day care, less violence
Other issues in focus were calls for more day care facilities and a reduction in violence towards and trafficking of women.
The poll found that women are more concerned than men about the economic situation, risks of globalisation and its likely impact of the euro. Women also want the EP to push for time spent looking after children at home to be counted towards pension entitlements.
During the seminar, Parliament's Vice-President Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou said the results offer "important elements about the female voters such as their expectations, their image of the EU, their priority policies to be defended or discussed during the campaign, their participation to politics in European level."
The European Commission's most senior women, Vice-President Margot Wallström said, "a democracy which does not make enough room for 52% of the population at the decision-making table is no real democracy at all."
Politics - a man's world?
The poll found that women are less interested in European issues, although the probability of voting in June elections was broadly similar for both genders (28% of women compared to 31 % of men).
It found that a clear majority of men (77 %) agree that men dominate the political scene and that more women in politics could lead to a different style. In terms of how they decide to vote, two thirds of women gave importance to candidates´ experience on European issues rather than political orientation.
The poll of 35,000 women and 5,500 men across the EU's 27 countries was conducted ahead of the June European elections and to mark International Women's Day on 8 March.
