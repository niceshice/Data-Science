Mr Buzek pointed out that: "The historical events also remind us of our responsibilities, including the need to support an emerging, young and vibrant civil society" and he underlined the "decisive role played by women during the Arab Spring".
The winners expressed their gratitude for the prize as an important symbol of Europe's vital support during the Arab Spring uprisings. They also pointed to the human rights challenges that their countries still face in their efforts to rebuild and set up genuinely democratic regimes that respect justice and human dignity.
Only two of the laureates were able to attend the award ceremony in person: Asmaa Mahfouz, a young blogger from Egypt, and Ahmed El-Senussi, Libya's longest-serving prisoner of conscience. Parliament observed a minute's silence in memory of Mohamed Bouazizi, whose self-immolation in protest at the Tunisian authorities' repression sparked widespread protests and who was awarded the prize posthumously, and of all those who lost their lives in the uprisings.
In her acceptance speech, Asmaa Mahfouz said: "This reward pays hommage to all those people in Egypt who have been much more courageous than me and actually sacrificed their lives on the streets. I would like to tell you how proud I am for all the martyrs of Arab revolution. We will not betray them, we will follow the road."
Ahmed El-Senussi pointed to the importance of reconciliation: "We need to rebuild our country, showing tolerance even towards those who committed crimes, who violated human dignity." He thanked Libya's European neighbours, the first to go to Libya's aid, for their "unambiguous diplomatic and military support".
The Syrian cartoonist, Ali Ferzat, who is exiled in Kuwait, send a video message in which he voiced his gratitude for the prize and also his grief and sorrow at the number of victims in his home country Syria which "increases with every minute".
Syrian human rights lawyer Razan Zaitouneh, who is in hiding, sent a letter saying: "I would like to thank the European Parliament and everyone who has empathized with the uprising of our people, and who has supported it in whatsoever way, for the sake of a tomorrow free of repression, prisons, and blood-spilling. For all brave people in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain and beyond. For those who got their freedom, and those who are still struggling for it."
