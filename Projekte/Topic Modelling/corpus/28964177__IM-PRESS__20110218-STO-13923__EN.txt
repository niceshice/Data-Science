Around 200 new images of child pornography appear on web every day. According to MEPs, member states still don't do far enough to prevent this type of crime. New proposed EU directive, voted last week by Parliament Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee calls for new mechanism that would prevent access to them. Authorities should be able to either remove the objectionable pages or make them inaccessible in case they are registered outside the EU.
Italian centre right MEP Roberta Angelilli (EPP) has drafted a report on a proposed EU directive on combating sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
On 14 February the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee approved amendments that child pornography or child abuse material on the web must be removed at source in all EU countries
Under the proposed new rules, European governments must impose binding requirements to ensure the removal at source of pages containing or disseminating child pornography.
If the source is outside the EU, governments may prevent access in accordance with national legislation and co-operate with third countries to secure the prompt removal of such material from servers hosted in those countries.
Also approved by the Committee were;
Tougher penalties: proposal sets minimum penalties (one to over 10 years in prison) for 22 criminal offences regarding sexual abuse or exploiting children
A ban on work with children: convicted offenders may be temporarily or permanently prevented from exercising professional activities involving direct and regular contact with children, (20% reoffend when released from jail)
The criminalization of 'grooming' (befriending children through the web with the intention of sexually abusing them)
Strengthened rules on assisting, supporting and protecting victims during investigation
When negotiations between the European Parliament and national governments conclude (probably in the first half of this year), governments will have two years for implementation.
