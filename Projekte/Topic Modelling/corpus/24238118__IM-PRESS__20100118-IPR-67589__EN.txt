Linking six Member States over its 3,000 km course, the Danube River has seen a long history of co-operation projects but a comprehensive EU strategy is still lacking. Following the example of the Baltic Sea Strategy, MEPs want the Commission to promote co-operation around the Danube region with the aim of developing environmentally-friendly transport connections and energy infrastructures, as well as stimulating economic and social growth.
The European Parliament's resolution, adopted on Thursday by 544 votes to 13, with 10 abstentions , calls on the Commission to start broad consultations as soon as possible with all countries along the Danube and to determine a "governance structure" for a strategy which aims to ensure wealth, sustainable development, job creation and security for the whole area.
"Action plan" for environmentally-friendly transport
MEPs want the Commission to draw up an "Action Plan" for the implementation of projects promoting inland navigation along the river, the creation of a multi-modal transport system to be connected to neighbouring countries (such as Moldova and Ukraine), and the use of environmentally-friendly energy resources, such as water power, solar power and wind energy.
Environmental assessments, including studies of the effects on the eco-system of the river, should be a prerequisite for all transport and energy infrastructure projects, the resolution insists. In parallel to these initiatives, a comprehensive plan for conserving and restoring the natural fish stocks in the Danube should be prepared by the Commission, say MEPs.
Funding for the strategy would be found through "enhanced synergies between different EU policies" already in operation in the region, such as the Cohesion Policy and the European Neighborhood Policy. MEPs advocate a "more efficient and higher absorption of all the EU funds available".
Finally, the resolution proposes that an "EU Danube Summit" be held every two years, following consultation with local and regional actors.
