Fight against fraud - 2005-2006 - MEPs point to diverse national structures
Budgetary control
2008-02-19 - 12:39
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the fight against fraud 2005-2006. The report welcomes the fact that the reports on the protection of the Communities’ financial interests and, in particular, the report concerning the financial year 2006, have become more analytical.
The European Parliament notes, however, that the statistics rely on very diverse national structures with different administrative, judicial, supervisory and inspection systems.
Structural funds irregularities
The report points out that the amount affected by irregularities relating to structural actions increased by 17%, from €601 million in 2005 to €703 million in 2006 (Structural Funds €517 million, Cohesion Fund €186 million); these irregularities related mainly (75%) to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF); Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom accounted for approximately 85% of the amount affected (€438,1 million) relating to the Structural Funds in 2006; in many cases the beneficiaries had invoiced for non-eligible expenditure; the details were uncovered following the checking of documents.
House of Lords report - VAT loss unsustainable
MEPs note, furthermore, that the House of Lords estimates lost national VAT receipts in the United Kingdom for 2005 to 2006 at between GBP 3,500 million and GBP 4,750 million, which is at least GBP 9.6 million per day; cites the report which states: "The current mechanism for intra-Community VAT transactions is not sustainable."
MEPs also notes that, concerning structural actions, 84% of all irregularities were recorded in Italy (2006: €228,2 million), Spain (2006: €85,7 million), the United Kingdom (2006: €59,8 million), Portugal (2006: €37,2 million) and Germany (2006: €27,2 million).
MEPs want the Commission to indicate which further actions it will undertake to put a stop to the fraudulent importing of televisions, cigarettes and counterfeit goods in general. The House welcomes the fact that OLAF has been able to open an office in China and urges the Commission to step up the fight against counterfeiting. MEPs call on the Commission to report back to Parliament's competent committees before March 2008 on the initiatives and action taken on the basis of Parliament's resolution of 11 October 2007 on the implications of the agreement between the Community, Member States and Philip Morris on intensifying the fight against fraud and cigarette smuggling.
Organised crime
The House calls on the Commission to provide Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control with a detailed analysis of the system or systems used by organised crime, whether run on mafia lines or not, to undermine the Communities' financial interests.
The European Parliament expresses its deepest concern over the following finding of the President of the Court of Auditors: ‘The supervisory and control systems in the Member States were generally ineffective or moderately ineffective, and the supervision of their operation by the Commission was only moderately effective’.
MEPs call, therefore, on the Member States to guarantee the quality of their supervisory and control systems by adopting, at an appropriate political level, a national declaration on management concerning all Community spending in shared management.
