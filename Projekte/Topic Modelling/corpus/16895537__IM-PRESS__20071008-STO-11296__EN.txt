More similarities than differences? As US Vice-President Joe Biden addressed the European Parliament Wednesday we look at some of the differences and similarities between the Parliament and the US Congress. His visit comes just days after the opening of the Parliament's liaison office in Washington. We also spoke to some MEPs about how they see the similarities and differences.
Speaking at the opening of the liaison office on 29 April EP President Jerzy Buzek said, "the main purpose of the office is to build a much closer partnership between the European Parliament and Congress as the European Parliament is more powerful after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty".
German Christian Democrat Elmar Brok is head of delegation for relations with the US. He told us, "after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers of the European Parliament are proximate to those of the Congress as never before: The EP is co-legislator on 95% of EU law, has the full power of the purse and improved oversight over the European Commission."
He added, "the rejection of the planned SWIFT agreement on the transfer of European bank transaction data to the US is an example that illustrates how the Parliament is willing and able to exercise its powers."
"Even though the EP has now nearly the same formal rights as the US Congress, we now face the challenge of developing a political culture in which the EP actively uses its powers and increases its bargaining power. Only if we achieve this can the EP can become as powerful as the Congress in practice," Mr Brok said.
Some differences
Initiating legislation : Congress can initiate legislation, the EP cannot.
Electoral terms : Congressmen sitting in the House of Representatives serve 2 year terms, while MEPs are elected for 5 years.
Plurality : "The main and decisive difference is that Congress representatives interact with one federal administration, while we, in the EP, face a plurality of EU institutions and 27 Member State governments" according to Portuguese Socialist Ana Maria Gomes .
Members : There are 736 MEPs in one chamber. There are 2 US chambers, the Senate with 100 members and the House of Representatives with 435. About 17% of the Congress is female compared with 32.5% of MEPs.
Committees : The Parliament has over 20 committees whilst the Congress has around 200.
Political parties : 2 big parties in the US and 7 political groups in the EP.
Languages : Congress works in English whilst the European Parliament works in all 23 languages.
And a few of the similarities...
Legislative process : both bodies draft reports, have committee meetings and hearings and vote in plenary sessions.
Similar goals : serving the electorate; working on Committees, the house and in constituencies; seeking re-election.
