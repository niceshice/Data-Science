People head to choice boxes to say what they want from the EU A conversation is taking place across Europe as people use choice boxes to record their questions and comments on what the European Union should be doing ahead of the European elections from 4-7 June. They also give people an opportunity to say what they think MEPs should concentrate on in the future. Watch a cross-section of the recordings of men, women and children from across Europe talking about everything from energy and voter apathy to immigration and "keeping it real".
Take the opportunity to voice your opinion. In the UK you can find the choice boxes in the following locations:
Edinburgh : Festival Square, 4-8 May.
Liverpool : Williamson Square, 30 May-2 June.
Glasgow : Buchanan Street, 11-15 May.
Newcastle : Grey's Monument, 11-15 May.
Manchester : Albert Square, 19-22 May.
In the Republic of Ireland the Choice box can be found in Dublin city centre.
The boxes are open from 0900 to 1800. A selection of the clips is being shown on a giant screen in Brussels next to the European Parliament's building and on europarltv.
