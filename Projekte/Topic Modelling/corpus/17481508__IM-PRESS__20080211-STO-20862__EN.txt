It's a packed week at the European Parliament, kicking off on Monday with discussions on research, globalisation and the labour market between MEPs and MPs and followed on Thursday by a visit from the UK heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales, who will speak to MEPs about climate change. You can watch both events live on the website.
MEPs and MPs get together for their fourth Lisbon Strategy parliamentary meeting on Monday and Tuesday. The focus of the meeting co-organised by the Slovenian Parliament and the EP will be the internal market, responses to globalisation, investment in people and monitoring the Lisbon Strategy, which aims to make the EU the most competitive global economy by 2010. You can watch live from 1500 Monday and 0930 on Tuesday.
On Thursday, there's a royal visit to the EP. Prince Charles will address an invited audience of MEPs on a subject close to his heart - climate change. See what he has to say from 1030.
Thursday is Valentine's Day and we wondered what would be in a European Union policy on love, so we asked MEPs for their feelings. Read the results here on Thursday.
Also on the website this week you can read an interview with Swedish Socialist MEP Jan Andersson about what constitutes "decent work" in the context of work for all on Wednesday. Find out what MEPs think about the future of fisheries also on Wednesday and read all about the 2008 capitals of culture on Tuesday.
The EU takes on a number of trainees each year and we were there when they met up with EP President Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering - read our article on Friday. Last but not least, it's the year of intercultural dialogue so read our focus on Tuesday to find out all about it and see which cultural icons have already visited the EP.
