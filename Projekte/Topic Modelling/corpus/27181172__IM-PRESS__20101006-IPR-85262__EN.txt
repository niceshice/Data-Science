New Basel bank capital standards need fine-tuning, say MEPs

The new Basel capital requirement standards agreed in late September tackle some of the right issues, but much more preparatory work is needed if they are to be transposed into laws that ensure a global level playing field and reduce excessive risk, yet without hampering economic growth, says an own-initiative resolution passed by a show of hands in plenary session on Thursday.
The resolution gives a foretaste of the position the Parliament will take later this year when it examines the Commission legislative proposal (CRD IV) to enshrine the Basel standards in law.
"The Basel agreement seems to be considered as a done deal. But there are still some important pending issues and no level playing field between the EU and the US", said draftsman Othmar Karas (EPP, AT), taking the floor before the vote.
Key points in the resolution
Attention must be given to the cumulative impact on banks of the new Basel standards and all other regulations currently in force or under preparation.
No analysis has been undertaken of the effects on the real economy of the figures agreed in Basel. The Commission should produce a comprehensive assessment of the consequences of the new standards.
European specificities regarding corporate financing need to be taken into account in the Commission's legislative proposal. A "one size fits all approach" could stifle economic recovery.
The definition of what is to be considered as "capital" is still pending. When it draws up the CRD IV proposals, the Commission must look closely at eligibility criteria for core tier 1 capital.
Recently-passed laws in the US could lead to serious inequalities in the implementation of the current Basel standards (Basel II) and those agreed by the Basel committee in September, especially given that recognition of external rating agencies is restricted and that the standards apply only to certain types of banks. The Commission is asked to look into this, due to concerns about the lack of a global level playing field.
Although a useful tool, great care must be taken with regard to the use of the "leverage ratio" concept, since it could create adverse incentives and may be designed in a way that does not include off-balance sheet items or derivatives for example.
It will be important to monitor banks to ensure that they do not pass on the costs of implementing the Basel III rules to end-users of financial services.
The Commission's proposals for giving legal effect to the Basel standards are to be tabled in spring 2011. As co-legislator, the European Parliament will then need to work out a final agreement with the Council on a legal text.
