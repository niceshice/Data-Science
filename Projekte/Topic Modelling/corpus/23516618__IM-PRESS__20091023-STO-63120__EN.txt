The visit coincides with a crucial point for a climate bill in the US Senate, which could define US energy use for decades. The EU's stated policy is a 20% cut in CO2 emissions by 2020 but this could rise to closer to 30% if other key international partners like Washington and Beijing are on board.
Also this week, EU leaders meet in Brussels to work out a common European Union position for the UN Climate Change Conference from 7 to 18 December in the Danish capital and on try to get agreement on the contentious issue of "climate financing" for poorer and developing countries.
€30 billion a year to help developing countries
On 19 October the Environment Committee said the EU should be willing to commit itself at Copenhagen to €30 billion in financing per year by 2020 to allow developing countries to adapt and mitigate climate change. However, there are differences between EU members, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, who are fearful of footing a disproportionate bill for some countries outside Europe. The proposal will be discussed by the full Parliament during their 11-12 November sitting.
The Chair of the Environment Committee, German Socialist Jo Leinen, is keen that agreement is reached before the December summit. Speaking in a press conference after the committee vote he said "it would be disastrous" if Europe went to Copenhagen without single position on burden-sharing and financing developing countries.
One solution suggested by MEPs would be emission auctioning as a first source of financing then "debt-for-nature" swaps between Europe and the developing world and possibly a tax on international financial transactions. Parliament discussed climate change and developing countries during the 19-22 October plenary.
MEPs want airplane and ship emissions included
As well as money for developing countries MEPs on the Committee want shipping and international aviation included in any climate deal. They are not included in the Kyoto climate protocol, which expires soon, but constitute two of the fastest growing sectors for CO2 emissions.
The Committee also feels the EU should be more adventurous and aim for emissions cuts of 25-40% by 2020.
To improve the trade in carbon and make energy saving more efficient MEPs also want to see a genuine transatlantic carbon market created which would eventually lead to a global one.
