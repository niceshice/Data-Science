One face of the future of EU
Across Europe couples are on average having 1.5 children, below the 2.1 needed to replace the population. Historically, food shortages and infant mortality have been the main factors regulating the population level, with these gone in Europe – why are there less children? Fewer marriages, changing family patterns, growing prosperity and contraception are all playing a part. Two European Parliament reports this year have looked at the issues.
When the last statistics were compiled in 2005 (when there were 25 EU countries) the highest rates of fertility were in France and Ireland, with 1.90 and 1.99 respectively. The lowest were in the Czech Republic (1.23), Slovenia (1.22), Poland (1.23) and Slovenia (1.25).
A shrinking population?
Demographers have estimated that if fertility rates fall to 1.3 children per couple, in 100 years the population could fall to less than a quarter of its current size.
New family arrangements and lifestyles are affecting rates of fertility, as are the growing number of women having children at a later date or not having children due to concerns about the potential effect on their careers.
In a 2004 an EU-funded study by the Robert Bosch Foundation found the costs of having another child and fears about the society they would grow up in were key reasons not to have a child. It also found that women generally would like to have more children than they actually have.
In December, Parliament’s Employment Committee will be discussing an own initiative report, “ the demographic future of Europe”, drafted by French Socialist MEP Françoise Castex.
It calls for
appropriate public policies, providing the necessary framework of stability for maternity decisions.
public spending on young children, childcare facilities and social security for the growing number of single mothers, who are at particular risk of social exclusion, isolation and poverty.
establishing the right to parental leave for both parents and promoting paternity leave.
There is also a need to make it easier for people to reconcile study and family life. The proportion of students who are also parents is very low (Ireland, 11.3%, 10.8% in Austria and10.7% in Latvia). The exception is Sweden with 41%, which has a range of social and economic measures to help students who are parents.
A report by Greek MEP Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou (EPP-ED) adopted in the June Plenary aims to redress the situation and thus help young women to benefit from high quality employment opportunities. The main points of the report are:
simple and easy loans on beneficial terms to young men and women who are combining family responsibilities with a period of study or training.
housing that is suited to the needs of students who are also parents.
access to childcare under the same criteria as working parents.
