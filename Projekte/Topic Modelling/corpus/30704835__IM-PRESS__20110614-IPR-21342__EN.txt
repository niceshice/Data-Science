The European Parliament's Budgets Committee on Wednesday approved €20,429,316 of EU funding for 1775 workers who were made redundant in Denmark by two firms, LM Glasfiber and Odense Steel Shipyard.
Denmark applied for €6,247,415 for the redundant workers of LM Glasfiber and €14,181,901 for those of Odense Steel Shipyard. In all, 1650 employees at LM Glasfiber (of whom 825 were targeted for assistance) and 1356 at Odense Steel (of whom 950 were targeted for assistance) lost their jobs.
Next steps
Following the committee's green light, the aid will need to be approved by Parliament. The plenary vote is scheduled for the session of 4-7 July. The Council of Ministers has approved the aid on 30 May.
The EGF was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. The annual ceiling of the fund is €500 million.
