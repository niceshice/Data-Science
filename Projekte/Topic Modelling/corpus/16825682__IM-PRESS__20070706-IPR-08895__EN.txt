The House gave its seal of approval to a second-reading compromise package agreed with the Council on the second Community action programme on public health, which will run from 2008 to 2013. Parliament's negotiating team had accepted the budget figure proposed by the Council to make sure the new programme is up and running as of 1 January 2008.
The compromise, negotiated by the rapporteur for the Environment and Public Health Committee, Antonios Trakatellis (EPP-ED, EL), was overwhelmingly approved today by the full Parliament.
The programme was initially due to run from 2007 to 2013. At first reading the EP sought to increase the amount available over the whole period to €1,500 million but under the Financial Perspective adopted in 2005 this figure was cut to €365,600,000.
Under the compromise, Parliament has accepted the latter figure but given the delay in adopting the programme it will now run from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2013. Some of the funding is being used this year under the first health action programme, so the total figure for the remaining period is reduced in proportion.
The institutions also signed a declaration by which they undertake to explore ways of finding further money for the programme on a year-to-year basis.
As part of the compromise package, Parliament successfully pushed for the programme's objectives to include the reduction of health inequalities as well as the promotion of cross-border care and the mobility of patients and health professionals. And at the EP's instigation the text now contains specific references to complementary and alternative medicine as well as to major diseases including cancer.
What action can the EU take on health?
Healthcare systems are a matter for national governments but action on some areas of public health is often best carried out at European level. Epidemics, rules on exposure to chemicals, prevention of injuries and accidents at the workplace: these are the kinds of problems the EU can tackle, by laying down Europe-wide rules, boosting cooperation between national authorities, promoting best practice and data-swapping on illnesses and medicines, and promoting healthy lifestyles.
