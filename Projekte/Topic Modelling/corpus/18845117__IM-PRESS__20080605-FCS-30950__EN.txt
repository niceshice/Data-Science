Italy's Antonio Tajani and France's Jacques Barrot
As MEPs gather in Strasbourg on Monday much attention will be on the hearings for Jacques Barrot and Antonio Tajani. The departure of Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini for Italian politics means a reshuffle at the Commission. All nominees for commissioner posts must pass the scrutiny of the European Parliament's relevant committees and a vote in plenary. Mr Barrot, already in the Transport post, is nominated for Justice, Freedom and Security and Mr Tajani for Transport.
The aim of the question and answer session with MEPs is to test the candidates' knowledge of the area where they will work. Mr Barrot is no stranger to the procedure as he has been in the Commission since 2004. Mr Tajani has previously seen it from the other side: as an MEP.
Mr Tajani will take part in a hearing before the Transport Committee who will be joined by MEPs from the Budgets Committee. For Mr Barrot, the hearing will be organised by the Civil Liberties Committee and will also include participation from the Legal Affairs Committee and the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee.
In this focus we profile both men and show you where you can watch the confirmation hearings live.

Antonio Tajani
Commissioner designate for Transport Antonio Tajani Following his initial nomination to the Commission on 9 May, former MEP Antonio Tajani faces a confirmation hearing before the Transport Committee, and a delegation from the Budget Committee on 16 June. If MEPs subsequently vote in his favour, Antonio Tajani will be confirmed as Transport Commissioner, a post previously held by Jacques Barrot. He will also be a Commission vice president.
Who is Antonio Tajani?
Mr Tajani served as an MEP from 1994 until May this year, prior to this he worked as a leading print and radio journalist. He has also worked as a civil and military air traffic controller. In the Parliament he was a member of the EPP-ED political group and led his party's (Forza Italia) delegation within the group. He was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Security and Defence Sub-Committee.
Mr Tajani takes over the Italian commissioner post from Franco Frattini, who was recalled to Silvio Berlusconi's Italian government after the recent elections. If confirmed by Parliament he will face a charged June plenary agenda, which includes several transport reports on road safety and the establishment of the European Railway Agency.
Mr Tajani has two sons, 17 and 15 years old.

Jacques Barrot
Is Barrot headed from Transport to Justice? Jacques Barrot will replace Franco Frattini as Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security, if MEPs back him after the hearing. Commission Vice-President Barrot will be responsible for immigration, asylum and cooperation between police, judicial and customs authorities, but also fundamental rights and the fight against terrorism and organised crime. He is likely to be busy, as France, which takes over the EU Presidency on 1 July, has announced immigration as a top priority.
Who is Jacques Barrot?
The French politician already knows European corridors and habits. After a short appearance as Commissioner for regional policy from April- November 2004, he has been European Commissioner for Transport and Vice-President of the Commission since November 2004, as part of the Barroso Commission.
A Member of the right-wing UMP party - the party currently in power in France - Mr Barrot has served several times as a French Minister (Labour and Social Affairs minister in the 1990’s). He has also held national parliamentary and local mandates.
Born on 3 February 1937 in Yssingeaux, he graduated from the Institut d’Etudes Politiques de Paris and is a barrister.
