Criticising the militarisation by northern and southern Sudan of the disputed border region of Abyei, where escalating violence has led to hundreds of deaths and an exodus of the population, MEPs called on both sides, in a resolution passed on Thursday, to engage in an immediate constructive dialogue to find a peaceful solution on the region's status.
Since South Sudan voted overwhelmingly for independence in a January 2011 referendum, and is formally to declare its independence at the start of July, post-referendum arrangements between the north and south such as sharing oil revenues, using pipelines, border demarcation, citizenship and the division of debts and assets must be resolved, says the resolution, which was passed by a show of hands.
Tackling the humanitarian crisis
The safe management of returnees to the south, including allocating land and ensuring access to basic services, should be a priority, say MEPs. In addition to last year's €150 million, the EU announced on 17 May 2011 that €200 million would be allocated to South Sudan to support the most vulnerable populations.
Finally, MEPs call on international creditors to alleviate the debts of Sudan and South Sudan. Legislation should be put in place on foreign investments, mostly in natural resources, so that the domestic economy can benefit in order to combat poverty in South Sudan, they say.
Darfur
MEPs welcome the UN-backed consultations on the Darfur peace process and call on all parties to abide by the ceasefire and cessation of hostilities agreements already signed. However, the situation in Darfur remains a source of great concern and MEPs note that the UN Mission in Darfur recently reported bombardments by the government, and the taking hostage of several aid workers in the region.
