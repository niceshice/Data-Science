With Slovenia the euro zone now stands at 315 million citizens
New Year and a new currency - that was the story from Ljubljana as Slovenia became the first of the 10 countries that joined the EU in 2004 to embrace the euro. It is the second time in 15 years Slovene shoppers have had to adapt to new money after Yugoslav dinars gave way to Slovene Tolars in the early '90s. Some 234 million Slovene euro coins have been specially minted in Finland and are the first to feature a map of all the current EU members.
Slovenia will introduce the euro according to the "big-bang" scenario, which means that they have only 14 days of double circulation with the tolar and euro. After that, only payment in euro banknotes and coins will be possible.
Optimism, but fears of price rises
According to public opinion surveys, a majority of the 2 million Slovenes have a positive attitude to the adoption of the Euro, although they remain concerned about possible price hikes, which could occur because of incorrect converting and rounding of prices.
Last June, other Eurozone members gave the green light for Slovenia to join after the European Commission report that Ljubljana had met the "Maastricht" convergence criteria for membership of the Euro:
These are:
an inflation rate no more than 1.5% higher than the 3 best EU performers.
a government deficit of less than 3% of GDP.
the ratio of government debt / GDP must not exceed 60%.
a stable currency that hasn't fluctuated by more than 15% in the last 2 years.
Long term interest rates not more than 2% higher than 3 best in Euro zone.
It was the apparent failure to reach these strict criteria that doomed Lithuania's bid to join the euro in January as well. Slovenia becomes the first new country to adopt the euro as its official currency - joining 12 other members who have used it since its entry into circulation in 2002.
MEPs support dual pricing to allow shoppers to compare
A report adopted by MEPs in June, supporting Slovenia's candidacy, advocated dual pricing in euros and tolars for a fixed period so consumers could compare prices. It also called for an advertising campaign to encourage people to shop around to avoid price increases. Last year MEPs nominated Spanish Conservative José Manuel García-Margallo from its economic and monetary affairs committee to write an annual report on the performance of the whole euro area.
Prime Minister Janez Jansa expressed optimism saying that "for locating Slovenia on the world map, this will be a very good occasion."
This time next year Slovenia will also make another piece of history, becoming the first of the 2004 intake to hold the six month Presidency of the EU.
