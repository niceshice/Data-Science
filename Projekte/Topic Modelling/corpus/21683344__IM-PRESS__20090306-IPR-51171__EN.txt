intl-women-day_en According to a recent Eurobarometer Flash survey presented to the EP, 79% of Irish women totally or somewhat believe that politics is dominated by men. In the run up to the next European elections, Irish women want the next European Parliament to promote better day care services and bring an end to trafficking.
When asked what would be the most effective way to increase the proportion of women MEPs, 69% of women think this should be done through encouraging women to participate in politics. Only 6% support the idea of mandatory quotas, compared to 10% across the EU 27.
Expectations for the next European Parliament focus on the provision of better day care services in the domain of equality in family life. In terms of equality in society in general, 35% of Irish women think that the fight against violence and trafficking of women should be a priority.
Women are positive about the way that the EP represents their interests, with 52% agreeing to the statement, compared to just 39% across the whole of the EU. Irish women are also more positive than women in general across the EU about the impact of the EP on their welfare, rights, education and working life.
1264 women were interviewed in Ireland, and 35109 in the EU 27. European elections take place in Ireland on 5 June 2009.
