Aspirations to cut CO2 from transport are in a jam
MEPs will discuss how Europe can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its roads, airports and railways in Strasbourg on Monday evening. A quarter of all emissions come from transport and the figure is set to rise 30% by 2030. The debate will centre on a report by Italian MEP Gabriele Albertini (EPP-ED) which suggests ways in which transport can become more environmentally sustainable, including congestion charging for traffic based on the London experience.
The latest figures confirm transport as the black sheep of the European Union's attempt to meet its Kyoto targets. Between 1990 and 2005 greenhouse gas emissions for transport rose 26%. This figure is in fact an underestimation as it does not include aircraft emissions or those from ships - neither of which is covered by Kyoto. The Albertini report wants both sectors included in any future international agreements on the environment.
If the transport sector had registered the same fall in greenhouse gases as other areas, the total reduction in the emission of such gases would have fallen by 14% rather than just under 8%.
Mr Albertini's own initiative report advocates a number of practical steps to slow emissions:
Tax and congestion charging: The report favours taxing different forms of transport depending on how much they pollute. This could impact air travellers and people who drive larger cars. Mr Albertini wants Europe to embrace congestion charges for vehicles and road pricing and says "the experience of London can be a model for other cities". The report points out that congestion in towns and cities accounts for 40% of CO2 emissions for cars.
Alternative fuels/new technologies: The use of alternative fuels is essential if emissions are to fall. It calls on EU governments and the European Commission to invest far more in more efficient technologies. As Mr Albertini explains "it is clear any technology that could help us reaching goals like fuel efficiency, a reduction in demand for road and air transport could be a good one".
Protect sensitive areas: The report calls for a greater awareness of the importance of protecting environmentally sensitive areas of Europe like the sea and its mountains.
Aircraft: it also calls for air transport to be included in the EU's Emissions Trading scheme, steps to relieve airport congestion and reduce CO2 and noise pollution.
The growth of emissions is starting to alarm the experts. Speaking last week at a meeting of Parliament's Climate Change Committee, Gordon McInnes of the European Environment Agency said that "if nothing is done, the transport sector will soon be the biggest factor of CO2 emissions".
