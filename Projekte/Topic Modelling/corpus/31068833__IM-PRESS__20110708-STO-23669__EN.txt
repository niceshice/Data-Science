Polish presidency will focus on economic, foreign affairs Over the last 20 years Poland has gone from communism to a market economy and an EU member state. It now takes the rotating presidency of the Council for the first time. Polish Minister for European Affairs Miko≈Çaj Dowgielewicz explains how Poland wants to use its own example to boost euro-optimism. With a focus on economic issues and strengthening the political community, Mr Dowgielewicz says it's time to look on the bright side.
Can Polish "euro-enthusiasm" boost the European spirit within the EU?
I think so. Over the past 20 years Poland has had huge economic and political success. We went through an amazing transformation. It was not easy and it required a lot of difficult decisions and sacrifices. Maybe this economic success will show other Europeans that even in a really deep crisis there is light at the end of the tunnel. And that tough reforms can bring benefits to the citizens.
Economic issues are among Poland's priorities. How can a country outside the euro zone manage this well?
The Polish perspective can be very helpful. We're outside the euro zone, but we really benefited from the single market and we really developed due to the EU.
We can show that the discussion about the economy doesn't have to be limited to what is happening in the financial markets. We can show how you can benefit from the common market, trade, how we can use the budget to increase economic growth. We can show the brighter side of the discussion, not focus only on fiscal consolidation.
Poland will also focus on foreign affairs and plans a summit on the Eastern European Partnership. What do you say to experts who say the EU should be looking to the South?
One doesn't exclude the other. As the presidency we will support Catherine Ashton and the European External Action Service in their efforts to give countries in North Africa assistance in this difficult election period. Over the last months we were engaged in Tunisia and Egypt, so this subject is very close to our hearts.
The Eastern European Partnership is not replacing North Africa on our agenda. They are there simultaneously. We hope that the Eastern European Partnership summit will be the most important event during the Polish presidency and that it will include in its conclusions a new and better offer for our Eastern neighbours.
You worked in the Parliament and Commission. Does that help your work now?
It makes it easier, because I know a lot of the people working here - it's nice to see some familiar faces.
