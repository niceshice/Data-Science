During his visit to Italy to mark 50 years of the Rome Treaty President Pöttering yesterday met young immigrants in the Italian capital and reminded people that "what we all share is the value of human dignity". He went on to say that "Europe must help immigrants integrate into society". He said that "dialogue between cultures is indispensable" and that "it is unacceptable that so many people lose their lives...trying to make their way to EU shores".
He was speaking at the Community Sant' Egidio to young immigrants from Africa, Asia and Latin America. The religious Community was founded in 1968 and is dedicated to solidarity with the poor, ecumenism and dialogue. It has received numerous honours. President Pöttering is in Italy from 19-23 March as part of the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the Rome Treaty. During his stay he will meet immigrants, students, Italian political leaders, including President Giorgio Napolitano and Prime Minister Romano Prodi, as well as - in a private audience - Pope Benedict XVI.
