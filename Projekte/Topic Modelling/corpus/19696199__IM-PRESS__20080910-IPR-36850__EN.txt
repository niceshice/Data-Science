The three films, Delta, Le silence de Lorna and Obcan Havel, are competing for this year's edition of the European Parliament LUX Prize for cinema. The EP wishes to facilitate the circulation of European films and give a boost to cinematic work within the EU. The winning film will be subtitled in the 23 official languages of the European Union. The value of the LUX Prize is estimated at €87 000. The winner will be announced at a ceremony in the European Parliament on 22 October.
The three finalists are part of an official selection of 10 films, selected by a 17-strong independent panel drawn from the highest level of the cinema profession: producers, distributors, cinema operators, festival directors, critics, etc. In order to be eligible the film should illustrate the universality of European values and/or the diversity of European culture and/or bringing insights into the debate on the process of building Europe.
Finalists 2008
The three finalists for the European Parliament cinema prize LUX 2008 are:
Delta (2008, 92') by Kornél MUNDRUCZÓ (Germany, Hungary) is about a quiet young man who returns to the wild, isolated landscape of the Delta, a labyrinth of waterways, small islands and over-grown vegetation, where the villagers are cut off from the outside world. Here he is introduced to a sister he never knew he had, and they build a relationship that the local villagers have difficulties in accepting.
Le silence de Lorna (2008, 105') by Jean-Pierre and Luc DARDENNE (Belgium, UK, France, Italy). The film is about Lorna, a young Albanian woman living in Belgium who becomes an accomplice to a diabolical plan devised by mobster Fabio, in order to become owner of a snack bar together with her boy friend.
Obcan Havel (2008, 119') by Miroslav JANEK et Pavel KOUTECKÝ (Czech Republic) looks behind the scenes of international politics in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, and also into events in a post-totalitarian country during its transition to democracy. Václav Havel was a key figure in the great changes that took place in central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s – the film material captures his work and influence both in his country and internationally.
The screenings
The three films will be shown in the European Parliament from 15 September -17 October 2008. MEPs will choose the winner after having seen the films, and the prize will be awarded during a ceremony on 22 October. In 2007 the LUX Prize was awarded to the film "Auf der anderen Seite" by Fatih Akin.
Press Conference
Vice president of the European Parliament, Gerard Onesta, will hold a press conference Tuesday 16 September at 11 am in the Anna Politkovskaya Room - PHS 0A50 .
