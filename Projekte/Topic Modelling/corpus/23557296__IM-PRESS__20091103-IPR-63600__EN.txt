A plan to create a micro-finance to help people at risk of losing their jobs to start their own micro-enterprises was backed by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee on Thursday, but MEPs rejected the funding arrangements proposed by the European Commission.
The report by Kinga GÖNCZ (S-D, HU) proposed creating a specific budget line for the new facility, to enable people at risk of losing their jobs and the most disadvantaged to start their own micro-enterprises. Funding for this facility should amount to €150 million, say MEPs. The committee adopted this first-reading report with 41 votes in favour, 4 against and no abstentions.
The Commission had initially proposed that the micro-credit facility be allocated €100 million from the Progress programme for employment and social solidarity. Under the 2006 inter-institutional agreement, the Progress programme had in fact been allocated an additional €114 million, at Parliament's request. This Commission proposal was rejected by 41 votes to 4, with 1 abstention.
MEPs also asked the Commission to refrain from adopting specific financial measures concerning the Progress programme in 2010, until the legislative process on the micro-finance facility is concluded. This resolution was adopted with 42 votes in favour, one against and one abstention.
An informal trialogue with the Council is scheduled for 16 November, with a view to achieving an agreement at the first reading.
