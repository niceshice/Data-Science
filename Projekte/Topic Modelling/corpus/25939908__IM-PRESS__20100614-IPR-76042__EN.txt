The European Parliament on Tuesday approved EU contributions to the International Fund for Ireland until the end of 2010, ensuring implementation of the initial agreement which provided for EU financing of €15 million per year from 2007 to 2010.
The Fund, established in 1986 by the Irish and British governments to promote cross-community projects in support of the peace process in Northern Ireland, receives €60m from the EU as well as funding from the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
One of many projects supported by the Fund is "Football for Peace", which brings together young people from different communities, using football as a means to promote good relations through cross-border and cross-community partnerships. The Fund provides €527,954 for the project.
The report by Seán KELLY (EPP, IE) was adopted by 630 votes in favour to 9 against with 25 abstentions.
