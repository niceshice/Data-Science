Student Â©Belga/EPA MEPs adopted on 13 March a report calling for more funds and support to encourage student mobility and make European higher education more attractive and competitive. This would involve reinforcing the Bologna Process, which aims to create a European Higher Education Area by making quality standards and degrees more compatible throughout the continent. In addition to the EU, the Process is also implemented in 20 other European countries.
The Bologna Process required European universities to revise and reorganise their teaching activities in a three-cycle system (Bachelor, Master, and Doctorate) and also assist in creating wealth. If is to contribute to achieving the goals of the EU's 2020 strategy for kick-starting Europe's economy, then more efforts will need to be made by universities, member states and the European institutions. Italian Social-Democrat Luigi Berlinguer, the author of the report,stressed in the text: "It is a requirement for a full integration of the internal EU market and an indispensable tool for tackling the challenge provided by the economic and financial crisis."
Universities need financial support from member states and the EU to support their efforts to change and develop their education practices. Member states have to strengthen the funding system, while it is also necessary to develop new funding mechanisms.
In addition more needs to be done to harmonise academic standards, promote mobility and employability, remove administrative obstacle, improve the mutual recognition of qualifications (through the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System), and promote social cohesion.
