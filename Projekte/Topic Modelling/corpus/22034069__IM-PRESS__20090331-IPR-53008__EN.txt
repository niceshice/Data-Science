This week's Brussels plenary session was opened by European Parliament President Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, who made a statement expressing sadness on behalf of the House at the deaths of over 300 migrants who drowned off the Libyan coast earlier this week. As the migrants were hoping to reach Europe, "we are all challenged to find solutions" said the President. The House observed a minute's silence in respect of the victims. MEPs will hear a statement from the Commission on this matter later today.
