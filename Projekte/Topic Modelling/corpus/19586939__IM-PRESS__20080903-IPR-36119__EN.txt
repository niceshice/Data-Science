The European Parliament is urging the European Commission to adopt guidelines on state aid to ports by the end of this year. In an own-initiative report on European ports policy adopted by MEPs, the House urges the Commission to identify possible distortions of competition and to clarify in the state aid guidelines what types of aid to port authorities should be treated as state aid. MEPs also look at ways to upgrade the port system to meet the EU's future transport needs.
The own-initiative report adopted with 572 votes in favour, 12 against and 10 abstentions on the Commission communication on European Ports Policy, points out that the EU port sector is expanding fast and that the maritime sector is particularly affected by globalisation.

It advocates creating separate port zones for intra-community and international traffic, simplifying internal transport, and standardising and identifying special containers. It calls on the Commission and the sector to encourage shipping companies to reduce the number of empty containers transported, so as to reduce environmental impact, whilst at the same time taking account of the specific needs of clients.
Social dialogue in the port sector
The House urges that a social dialogue be established on port-related subjects, including worker's rights, concessions and the 1979 International Labour Organisation Convention on the occupational safety and health of dock workers. It also stresses the importance of protecting and ensuring the highest possible standard of training for port workers.
Scanning US-bound cargo
Finally, MEPs urge the Commission to pursue its efforts to win a reform of the US regulation requiring that 100% of US-bound cargo be scanned. It urges the Commission to evaluate the potential cost of this measure to busin
