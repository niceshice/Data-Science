MEPs to discuss EU strategy on Roma inclusion

This afternoon's debate on the Commission's upcoming EU strategy for Roma inclusion is expected to start at approximately 6pm. Equal access to employment, education, health and quality housing, the protection of fundamental rights and better use of EU funding are MEPs' priorities. Binding objectives and sanctions should also be laid down, says the draft resolution by Lívia Járóka (EPP, HU) on which Parliament votes on Wednesday.
Many of Europe's 10-12 million Roma people are poor and marginalised, in both rural and urban areas. EU policy and financial tools to support Roma inclusion do exist but they could work more effectively with binding minimum standards and better monitoring at European level, argues the Civil Liberties Committee. The Commission is expected to present its proposal on an EU strategy for Roma inclusion in April and the European Council is due to adopt it in June. Roma inclusion is one of the Hungarian Presidency's priorities.
