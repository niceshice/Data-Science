The Lisbon-based EU drugs agency EMCDDA will launch its 2005 Annual report on the state of the drugs problem in Europe at 11am on Thursday 24 November at the European Parliament. The previous day EMCDDA representatives will discuss the report with members of Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee.
This year, the report offers data from the 25 EU Member States, Norway and three EU candidate countries (Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey). The report carries four chapters dedicated to individual drugs, which are complemented by further chapters relating to: drug policy and law; schools, youth and drugs; and crime and prison. It will be available in 22 languages (19 EU + NO, BG, RO) at http://annualreport.emcdda.eu.int . The report is complemented by three 'selected issues' (in English) focusing on: drug-related public nuisance; alternatives to imprisonment for drug using offenders; and the use of buprenorphine in substitution treatment ( http://issues05.emcdda.eu.int ).
The annual report and related materials will be available on the agency's website http:// www.emcdda.eu.int on Thursday morning.
