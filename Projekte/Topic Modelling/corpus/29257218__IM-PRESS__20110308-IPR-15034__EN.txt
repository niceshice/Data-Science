Court of Auditors: Parliament approves Dr Wögerbauer's nomination
Budgetary control
Plenary sittings
2011-03-08 - 12:57
Austria's nomination of Dr Harald Wögerbauer to join the European Court of Auditors was approved by Parliament in a plenary vote on Tuesday. Dr Wögerbauer replaces Mr Hubert Weber, who resigned after serving on the Court for 15 years.
The Budgetary Control Committee approved the nomination on 3 March. In preparation for the committee hearing, Dr Wögerbauer replied to a written questionnaire, which is included in the draft report on his nomination (see link below).
Given that Dr Wögerbauer is an active member of the Austrian People's Party, many questions concerned his independence. He assured MEPs that he would resign from politics if his nomination to the Court is approved.
Result of the vote: 409 in favour, 219 against, 33 abstentions
The Council is expected to approve the appointment shortly.
Procedure: Interinstitutional non-legislative procedure
