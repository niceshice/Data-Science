The Industry Committee called on the European Commission on Thursday to propose legislation by July to at least double by 2020 the share of renewable energies used in Europe for heating and cooling. Benefits would include more secure energy supplies, reduced demand for conventional energy, a cleaner environment and the creation of jobs in new industries.
Around 50% of primary energy consumption goes on heating. Demand for energy for cooling is also growing. Legislation is urgently needed if the share of renewable energy - mainly geothermal, solar thermal and biomass - in these sectors is to be doubled from its present level of 10% by 2020 and also to reach the target of 12% of renewable energies in total energy consumption by 2010 as laid down in the 1997 EU white paper on renewable energy.
In their report, MEPs make detailed recommendations to the Commission on the content of such legislation. It would provide a framework for national instruments and would fill a legislative gap, as EU strategies already exist to promote electricity from renewable sources and to promote biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport.
The legislation would need to provide long-term investment and planning security, which is crucial for energy investors. Financial incentives would be provided by the Member States, although national support schemes should in the end be phased out. For example, Member States might use tax breaks or direct investment aid or make renewable energy plants mandatory for new buildings. The EU, for its part, could encourage the use of the structural and cohesion funds to support research into the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling.
These proposals were made under a little-used procedure, which enables Parliament to request the Commission to submit draft legislation (Rule 39 of the EP Rules of Procedure - see link below). The Industry Committee's draft resolution still needs to be approved by a majority of the Members of Parliament (i.e. at least 367 out of 732). The committee's text, drafted by Mechthild Rothe (PES, DE), was adopted with 39 votes in favour and only 3 abstentions and so stands every chance of being adopted in plenary.
