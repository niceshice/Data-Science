Ahead of the seventh European Day for the Victims of Terrorism, which takes place tomorrow, March 11, the European Parliament observed a minute's silence for the over five thousand victims of terrorism in Europe. "Terrorism can never be justified", said Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek. It is a "shameful, deceitful and cowardly" act, he stressed.
In a statement made before today's voting session, Mr Buzek said: "Terrorists declared war against civilians. They strike in places where ordinary people should feel safe - in their own country. This is shameful, deceitful and cowardly. That is why terrorism can never be justified".
"We Europeans are strong and united. No terrorist or any criminal organisation is able to weaken our faith in the values which built our united Europe", said the President.
This commemoration marks the Madrid bomb attacks on 11 March 2004 in which nearly 200 people died and the London bombings of 7 July 2005 in which over 50 were killed.
