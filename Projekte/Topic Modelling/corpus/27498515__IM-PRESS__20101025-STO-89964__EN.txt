Greek Socialist MEP Chrysoula Paliadeli pictured in her Brussels office during the interview OPEN TO ALL 27 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES INTENDED TO MARK VALUES & IDEAS A proposed voluntary European Heritage Label to reflect sites that symbolise values like democracy, freedom or diversity has been backed by Members of Parliament's Culture Committee. Meeting on 27 October they gave the scheme the green light. Countries could apply with the decision being made by a panel of historians and experts. Greek Socialist MEP Chrysoula Paliadeli drafted a report on the issue based on the European Commission's original proposal. We spoke to her about the proposed label.
Which are the main objectives of the European Heritage Label?
CP: The main objective is European cohesion between citizens of different countries with special emphasis being put on young people. As we know culture brings young people together with the Erasmus student exchange programme being an example. It provides an opportunity for cooperation between countries.
For example, under the proposed scheme, France could apply for a site together with Germany based on sites that reflect a certain idea. We also need and wish to fill in the gap between the European Union Institutions and citizens.
Is this like the UNESCO list?
CP: No. UNESCO award tangible monuments and intangible ideas in relation to their architectural, aesthetic and natural beauty. The European heritage label is something more symbolic which is related to values and ideas such as democracy, freedom and coexistence in diversity, rather than beauty or aesthetics.
How will sites be chosen for the European Heritage Label?
CP: There will be experts who are going to choose the sites, initially on a national level. Then, these applications will be checked by a panel of experts. The experts will be selected according to their expertise, for example historians, architects, sociologists. The expert panel will cover all possible applications relating to the main prescription: symbolism, education, cohesion and bringing the EU closer to citizens.
