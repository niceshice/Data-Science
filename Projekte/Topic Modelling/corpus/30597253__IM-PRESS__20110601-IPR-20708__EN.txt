Widely-divergent views as to the effectiveness of forthcoming EU-wide nuclear "stress tests" were voiced in a lively debate on Thursday. Many EPP group MEPs felt that the tests would improve safety, but Greens doubted that they would have any real effect. Most groups were unhappy that the tests are only voluntary. Several MEPs asked whether plants that fail the tests would be shut down.
Most criticism focused on testing criteria, the lack of independent control and the lack of immediate results- such as the closure - should a plant fail the tests. Several MEPs also regretted that the tests do not address the possibility of terrorist attacks.
Commissioner Oettinger replied that stress tests are the best available solution, since national regulators and inspectorates are very reluctant to accept EU-wide shared criteria. He added that terrorist attacks had not been included in the criteria because Member States were unwilling to include their intelligence services and armed forces in the procedure or to release confidential information. On neighbouring countries, he said that Ukraine, Russia, Armenia, Switzerland and Turkey were willing to join in the next steps of nuclear stress testing.
