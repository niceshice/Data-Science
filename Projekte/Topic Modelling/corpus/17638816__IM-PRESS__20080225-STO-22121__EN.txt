We look at the upcoming Russian elections
Elections will feature this week on Europarl with a report from the recent Pakistan elections where MEPs acted as observers. The upcoming elections in Russia also fall under the spotlight as some Members who are experts on Russia give us their point of view. Neighbouring Ukraine will also feature as we publish an exclusive interview with Parliament's speaker Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who is in Brussels for an EU-Ukaine parliamentary cooperation committee.
Later in the week we investigate the state of Europe's supermarkets following the adoption of a written declaration last week in which MEPs asked the Commission to look into whether they are abusing a dominant position.
China's growing influence in Africa will also be examined as we speak to Portuguese Socialist MEP Ana Maria Gomes who acted as Parliament's rapporteur on Beijing's policy in Africa. Parliament's development committee will be considering this report on Wednesday morning.
This is just a taster of some of the stories we will be publishing this week. Click in day by day for all the news and views from the Parliament.
