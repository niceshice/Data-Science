The European Parliament will hold a special commemorative ceremony on Wednesday in memory of all those who died when the plane carrying Polish President Lech Kaczyński and an official delegation crashed near Smolensk in Russia on Saturday morning.
EP President Jerzy Buzek will lead MEPs in an act of remembrance, which will include the reading of the names of all 96 victims, the playing of the Polish national anthem and the European anthem, and a minute’s silence.
The ceremony will take place in the plenary chamber in Brussels at midday on Wednesday 14 April. It will be transmitted live on Europe by Satellite and web-streamed on EP Live and europarlTV.
