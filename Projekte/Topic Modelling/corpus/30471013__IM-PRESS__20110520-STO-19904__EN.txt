Aim to raise awareness of 116000 hotline May 25 is International Missing Children's Day and on Wednesday evening Belgium's Queen Paola was in Parliament for a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of Missing Children Europe, a European Federation for missing and sexually exploited children, representing NGOs from 17 European countries.
The event was opened by EP Vice-President Roberta Angelilli , who said, "the greatest challenge is to spread the information and the photos of a missing child as early and broadly as possible" because the chance of finding a child are highest in the first 24 hours and then decrease rapidly. Also at the event were representatives of the Hungarian presidency and Commission vice-presidents Viviane Reding and Neelie Kroes.
This was followed Thursday by a conference aimed at raising awareness about the European hotline for missing children - 116000- which is operational in 15 EU countries and should be introduced in the others this year.
