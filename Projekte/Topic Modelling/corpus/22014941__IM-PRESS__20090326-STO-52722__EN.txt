Former Italian footballer Alessandro Costacurta, part of the famous AC Milan back 3 with Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini. The ambitions of a Belgian midfielder Jean Marc Bosman to move from Club de Liege to Dunkerque triggered a revolution in football. The 1995 ruling from the European Court of Justice cleared the way for players to leave their club when the contract ended and for clubs to hire as many foreign players as they wanted. A hearing in parliament on Monday 30 March looked at some of the areas still unresolved by the case such as settling disputes between players and clubs plus transfer rules.
The public hearing by the Committee on Legal Affairs also looked at the laws that govern football, rules covering the transfers of young players and proposals by FIFA, the sports governing body, to restrict the number of foreign players to try and protect a football club's domestic and home support.
The hearing brought together MEPs, former footballers, academics and representatives of the governing body of European football - UEFA.
Costacurta lauds foreign stars
The Bosman ruling gave enormous freedom, power and in some cases fortunes to players and sports agents alike. Without it teams like Arsenal or AC Milan would not have been able to buy some of Europe's best players and go on to domestic and continental glory.
One player present at the hearing was former AC Milan and Italy defender Alessandro Costacurta. He played for the Milanese giants from 1987 to 2007. Prior to the Bosman ruling he played alongside the three foreign players that each club were allowed at the time. In Milan's case it was the Dutch master class of Marco van Basten and Ruud Gullit who were signed by the club's owner Silvio Berlusconi in 1987 with Frank Rijkaard joining a year later.
Mr Costacurta told those present at the hearing that playing with such players "enriched our game and made us less provincial." Later, after the Bosman ruling he played alongside more non-Italian players, notably the French domiciled Liberian player George Weah who helped "broaden our knowledge and made us less arrogant."
