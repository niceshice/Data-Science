Towards a common EU energy policy

Rising oil and gas prices, energy disputes with Russia, growing energy demand, and the running down of hydrocarbon reserves, are lending new urgency to European Parliament debates on how best to ensure the security of EU energy supplies. MEPs call for a more ambitious common energy policy, and have approved legislative measures and resolutions that aim to improve energy efficiency, bring new EU Member States into the EU single energy market and ensure security of supply.
This work is urgent. Oil and gas prices have almost doubled in the EU over the past two years, with electricity prices following. Unless the EU can make domestic energy more competitive, in the next 20 to 30 years around 70% of the Union's energy requirements, up from 50% today, will be met by imported products - some from regions threatened by insecurity. At the same time, the import demands of emerging large economies (China, India) are set to intensify worldwide competition for energy supplies.

EP priorities
In several resolutions, Parliament advocates a common European energy policy, including binding targets on renewable energy, sector-specific targets and a reduction in CO2 emissions. It has called for increased investment in energy R&D, to achieve the key policy aims of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability. By 2020, the EU should become the world's least fossil-fuel dependent and most energy-efficient economy, say MEPs.
Energy efficiency is the "greatest, fastest and cheapest reaction to energy security worries, rising and volatile energy prices and environmental concerns", says Parliament in an own-initiative report adopted on 1 June 2006. The report notes that if existing legislation (e.g. on the energy performance of buildings, combined heat and power, eco-design, emissions trading and energy end-use efficiency) were implemented in full, the EU would already be half way to meeting its target of saving 20% of energy use by 2020, in line with the Commission's Energy Efficiency Action Plan.
Looking to the future, the EU needs to take a common stance vis-Ã -vis third countries to enhance its ability to negotiate with energy producing and consuming countries, said MEPs in a report that was adopted in plenary in December. The report also stresses that consumers must be placed at the centre of all future energy policies, and that measures to address "energy poverty" (i.e. when energy bills exceed 10% of household income) should feature more clearly in the Commission's proposals.

Savings: a source of security
EU energy consumption is currently an estimated 20% higher than can be justified on economic grounds - suggesting both that there is a large stock of energy savings to be tapped and that energy demand management can help to secure supplies. During this half-legislature, Parliament has been working on several proposals to consolidate the EU energy market and make it work better, so as to safeguard supplies and use them more efficiently. These proposals, together known as the package on the security of energy supplies , were first tabled by the European Commission at the end of 2003, in response to severe blackouts across Europe. Establishing regional markets for gas and electricity is seen as a first step towards a truly integrated EU market.
Energy security package
EU Directive on energy efficiency and energy services - Under this Directive, adopted in December 2005, EU Member States must draw up national plans to achieve 9% energy savings in the supply and distribution of electricity, natural gas, urban heating and other energy products, including transport fuels, over nine years starting in January 2008. The target is "indicative", not binding as the energy committee wished, but the Member States' national action plans will need approval from the Commission and will be reviewed every three years. The underlying aim of this directive is to save enough energy to offset future increases in energy consumption. MEPs are pleased that public authorities are expected to set an example and to contribute savings, e.g. by tailoring public tender requirements to favour more energy-efficient goods and services.
A Decision on guidelines for Trans-European energy networks (TEN-E), adopted by Parliament in April 2006 the EU Council of Ministers in July 2006, maps out a Europe-wide electricity and gas network, incorporating the ten new EU Member States who joined in 2004. This decision reflected a second-reading compromise between Parliament and the Council. These guidelines aim to improve links among national markets and to strengthen relations with third countries in the energy sector, so as to attract investment, and to give customers the benefit of better service quality, a wider choice of energy mix and competitive prices. They provide for 42 high-priority interconnection "projects of European interest", scheduled to start before the end of 2006 and be completed in 2010.
A Regulation on access to gas networks , adopted by Parliament and the Council in 2005, aims to set fair rules for accessing natural gas networks, taking into account the specificities of national and regional markets, so as to ensure that the EU gas market functions properly. It lays down harmonised principles for, inter alia, defining network access tariffs, allocating capacity, managing congestion and trading capacity rights. The regulation has applied since July 2006.
A Directive on energy infrastructure and security of electricity supply , adopted by the EU Council of Ministers in December 2005 after a first-reading agreement between Parliament and the Council in July 2005, requires EU Member States to define security standards for their power networks and seeks to increase interconnections among countries so as to enable effective competition among businesses in a liberalised electricity market.

Renewable energies for heating and cooling
The heating and cooling of buildings accounts for 40% of the EU's total energy consumption, and relies heavily on imported oil and gas. Yet the cost of increasing the share of renewable energies in these areas is comparatively low. So in a September 2005 resolution, based on an own-initiative report, Parliament called on the European Commission to propose legislation to boost the share of renewable energy - mainly geothermal, solar thermal and biomass - in heating and cooling. MEPs would like to see this share doubled from its present level of 10% by 2020. The benefits, they said, would include more secure energy supplies, reduced demand for conventional energy, a cleaner environment and the creation of jobs in new industries. The Commission has since launched a public consultation on this question, before deciding whether or not to propose legislation.
In the report, MEPs made detailed recommendations to the Commission on the content of such legislation. They would favour a directive that sets realistic but ambitious targets and co-ordinates the Member States' actions on the basis of temporary limited incentives for market access.
EU legislation on renewables for heating and cooling would provide a framework for national instruments and would fill a legislative gap, as EU already has for promoting electricity generation from renewable sources and to promote biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport.
