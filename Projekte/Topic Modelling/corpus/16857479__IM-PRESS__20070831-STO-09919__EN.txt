Fires devastate Greece
For many, the summer of 2007 was blighted by disaster: floods in the UK, drought and forest fires across southern Europe, with the recent destruction in Greece grabbing the attention of the entire continent. In its first sitting after the summer recess on Monday, Parliament will react to the forest fires in Greece: their consequences and the lessons to be learned for prevention and alert measures. On Tuesday, MEPs will vote on a separate resolution on the issue of natural disasters in Europe.
The fires in Greece have been particularly devastating. Over 60 people are reported to have died in the fires that broke out last Friday. The Greek authorities have requested assistance from European partners through the European Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre, a mechanism that facilitates the provision of civil protection assistance in and outside the EU. Many European countries have responded to the call by providing water-bombing aircraft to contain the blazes.
In Monday's debate, MEPs will question the Commission on EU action in response to the fires summer and generally look at how solidarity between countries can do more to prevent and tackle such catastrophic events.
