Celebrating Europe Day Liszt and Beethoven echoed through the European Parliament Monday during Italian pianist Giovanni Bellucci's concert to celebrate Europe Day. The concert also marked the 25th anniversary of Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" as the European anthem.
"Franz Liszt personifies the European genius, which makes our united Europe a success story of which we can all be proud," EP President Jerzy Buzek said, when introducing the concert. It was organised in Strasbourg on the occasion of the bicentenary of Franz Liszt's birth and the 25th anniversary of the European anthem.
Mr Bellucci played three Liszt Hungarian Rhapsodies and concluded with a touching interpretation of the 4th Movement from Beethoven's 9th Symphony, which was greeted with a standing ovation.
The 25th anniversary of the European flag was marked in the afternoon with a traditional flag raising ceremony by Eurocorps in front of the Parliament building.
