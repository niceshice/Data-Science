Most of Parliament's political groups welcomed on Tuesday the new framework for national Roma strategies, shortly after it was launched by the Commission. These measures are a step in the right direction and generally follow Parliament's guidelines, said MEPs, although some speakers called for further improvements on monitoring national strategies, involving Roma communities and tackling discrimination.
The framework for coordinating national Roma integration strategies was launched on Tuesday by the Commission. Commission Vice-President Viviane Reding (Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship) and Commissioner László Andor (Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion) presented to MEPs the new measures, which seek to boost the economic and social integration of Roma people by setting targets.
The EU framework will now be examined by Member States with a view to adoption by the European Council in June.
