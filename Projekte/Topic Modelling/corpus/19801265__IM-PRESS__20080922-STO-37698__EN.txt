Focus on financial crisis In the wake of last week's financial turbulence, MEPs on Tuesday demanded new legislation to beef up EU financial market regulation. The financial crisis dominated the political groups' briefings of journalists in their regular press conferences. We were there to hear what was on their minds ahead of the special debate on the subject Wednesday afternoon.
"The European Union has to learn lessons from this crisis in terms of regulations of our financial markets," the head of the European People's Party and European Democrats Joseph Daul said. Fellow Christian Democrat, Alexander Radwan added, "Europe has to play pioneering role in this issue."
"What we expect from the Commission is not only an assessment of the financial market crisis but we have to look into new developments...so that we can avoid such scenarios occurring in the future," Mr Radwan said, calling for better coordination between European supervisors. The leader of the ALDE group, Graham Watson agreed, "we need better regulation of financial markets. We should have never allowed banks to lend up to 30 times their assets."
"But the baby should not be thrown out with the bath water," Mr Watson added. "We need to improve regulation of the markets without putting them in a straitjacket." The head of the Socialist group Martin Schulz said that "the market has to be but needs rules." He said more transparency is needed and called for better evaluation of the ratings agencies and better state monitoring.
MEPs will debate international financial markets and the impact of the crisis on Europe's economy Wednesday afternoon at 1500 CET - watch it live.
