A new mentality and public intervention are required, not only to change the very serious situation of women, but to improve society, said MEP Ms Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL, PT), at a public hearing on "Towards a new EU strategy for gender equality" held by the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee on Thursday.
The hearing was held to provide input for an own-initiative report, to be drafted by Ms Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL, PT), recommending actions and initiatives for a new EU gender strategy, based on an assessment of the results of the Roadmap for equality between women and men (2006-2010).
Objectives and priorities for a new EU gender equality strategy
The EU has the best gender strategy in the world, yet it could be better, said Prof. Sylvia Walby, UNESCO Chair in Gender Research, Department of Sociology, Lancaster University, UK.
MEPS generally agreed that there is a lack of comparable, valid and reliable data, and that more research should be done, inter alia on violence against women.
Livia Járóka (EPP,HU) criticised the very weak implementation of gender equality, especially in East European countries. This would lead to greater discrimination of ethnic minority groups, particularly Roma women, she said.
Prof. Giovanna da Molin, University of Bari, Italy, identified several categories of vulnerable women such as elder women, separated women with children and also single immigrant women.
A European observatory and "homogenous" strategy are needed to combat violence against women, said Ms Marisa Soleto, Director of Fundación Mujeres, Spain.
Marije Cornelissen (GREENS, NL) asked for an analysis of why, in some countries, more men take care of children than in others. She also said that measures have to be taken now with a view to the labour market and society 20 years hence.
"Instruments and tools for an effective EU strategy"
Edite Estrela (S&D, PT) said that the maternity leave question is connected to that of reconciling work and private life, and that it is thus essential to promote equality between women and men. She also asked also about providing for maternity and paternity leave at Community level, since parental leave sharing is already possible in some EU Member States.
Gender Institutes should be established in all Member States, said Britta Thomsen (S&D, DK), referring to the EU's 2002 Gender Equality Directive.
The Lisbon Treaty makes it mandatory to include gender mainstreaming, Commission representative Belinda Pyke replied to a question by Antoniya Parvanova (ALDE, BG), as to whether gender mainstreaming should be mandatory in all policies and Member States.
"Justice and equality belong to both women and men, and should be made visible in everyday life", said Ms Odette Filipe, Equality Co-ordinator of the Portuguese trade union confederation CGTP-IN .
Ms Figueiredo concluded that it is not enough to produce documents, "we have to mobilise ourselves", she said, adding that one has to learn from other countries, by sharing experience of best practices.
