'The latest statements attributed to the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are unacceptable.
On my own behalf and that of the European Parliament, I firmly condemn these revolting proposals.
I condemn them just as firmly as I did, in concert with the entire European and international community, the proposals he made on 27 October.
Today, alas, I find myself forced to repeat what I said then, and to say it even louder: the European Parliament will always be at the forefront of the struggle against the rejection of otherness, against intolerance, and against those who seek to heighten international tensions.
I have no doubt that I am very far from alone in deploring the fact that what we said then has had so little effect.'
