The position of women in Iran was debated by MEPs
The closing day of debates and votes in Strasbourg saw MEPs discuss economic incentives to help the environment through tax measures and the Emission Trading Scheme. A majority backed "market based initiatives" to help back up the "polluter pays" principle. During the afternoon's human rights debate, MEPs condemned Robert Mugabe's rule in Zimbabwe and expressed support for those imprisoned in Iran for their political views.
Protecting the planet - through the market?
MEPs debated a report by French Socialist Anne Ferreira on "market-based instruments for the environment and related policy purposes", based on a Commission Green Paper. "Market-based instruments" include taxation, the EU's Emission Trading Scheme, trade and technology. MEPs said "MBIs" are useful for enforcing the polluter pays principle but said they should not be a substitute for environmental legislation. Ms Ferreira urged action saying: "What is the cost linked to not doing anything?"
British Conservative John Purvis said the "emissions trading system is the best market instrument to reach the objective of reducing the emissions by 20%". British Socialist Neena Gill said that "it is essential to push for behavioural changes, and the one that pollutes the most should be the one that pays the most". Belgian Liberal Fr√©derique Ries told fellow MEPs that "we cannot limit the actions to the emissions trading system". She added, "each European should cause eight times less emissions if we want to reach the objectives."
Zimbabwe - MEPs denounce Mugabe regime
In a debate on Zimbabwe, MEPs from all sides of the House denounced the regime of Robert Mugabe. Opening the debate British Conservative Geoffrey Van Orden said, "Mugabe has destroyed a once prosperous country." The resulting resolution called on Zimbabwe's electoral committee to immediately release the results of the 29 March election. China and South Africa were criticised by some MEPs for their support of the Mugabe regime.
Iran - condemnation of the repression of civil rights movements
MEPs also discussed the position of women and human rights in Iran. A resolution condemned "the repression of civil society movements in Iran" and reaffirmed strong opposition to the death penalty. The number of executions has risen starkly in Iran in recent months. It welcomed the release of human rights activist Khadijeh Moghaddam - albeit for a large bail sum.
Some 14 EU states have pledged support for an EU-led peacekeeping force Chad. The resolution condemns the persecution and arbitrary arrest of opposition politicians and journalists. It also "stresses the need for politics in Chad to become more ethnically and geographically representative". Finally, it calls on EU Members who have not yet contributed troops to the EU force to consider doing so.
Burma - resolution calls for sanctions against Junta's business interests
MEPs called for EU countries to target sanctions at businesses and banking services used by Burma's military Junta. A resolution also calls for the immediate release of 1,800 political prisoners included Nobel winner Aung San Suu Kyi. MEPs said a forthcoming referendum of a new Constitution which guarantees power for the military is "devoid of any democratic legitimacy".
