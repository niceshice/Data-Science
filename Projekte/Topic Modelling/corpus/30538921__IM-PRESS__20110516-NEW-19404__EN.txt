Don't freeze EU budget for 2014-2020, say MEPs
2011-06-01 - 18:37
Freezing future EU budgets at 2013 levels - as some Member States demand - "is not a viable option", says Parliament's Policy Challenges Committee. Its budget recommendations for 2014-2020 will be debated on Wednesday and put to the vote on Thursday, ready for future budget negotiations with Member States. MEPs are calling for an increase of at least 5% over 2013 levels for the next long-term budget, known as the Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF). This increase is needed to achieve the aims to which Member States and Parliament have already committed themselves, says a resolution drafted by Salvador Garriga Polledo (EPP, ES).
If Member States disagree, then members of the committee challenge them to say which policy priorities should be dropped.
The committee wants regional policy and agriculture funding to remain at current levels, but increases for investment in energy infrastructure. It also acknowledges that further savings could possibly be made on EU administration.
MEPs point out that the current funding system relies almost entirely on national contributions. They call for an end to all rebates, exceptions, and corrective mechanisms. A system of real own resources - as the Treaty prescribes - would be "fairer, more transparent, simpler and equitable", as it would neither affect the size of the budget nor increase the overall tax burden on citizens, adds the resolution.
Rapporteur Salvador Garriga Polledo (EPP, ES) and committee chair Jutta Haug (S&D, DE) will hold a press conference after the vote, on Wednesday 8 June at 14.30 in the Strasbourg press conference room.

Charging lorries for noise and air pollution
2011-06-01 - 18:37
EU Member States would be entitled to set "polluter pays" road tolls to reflect the real cost of noise and air pollution by heavy goods vehicles, under a proposed change to "Eurovignette" rules to be put to a vote on Tuesday. This change, already provisionally agreed by Transport Committee MEPs and Member State representatives, would be an important step forward in "greening" goods haulage, say MEPs, as it would enable Member States to apply the "polluter pays" principle, already in use in other industry sectors, to three-quarters of inter-European haulage.
The average additional cost to hauliers should not exceed 4 euro cents per vehicle, per kilometre, and the least-polluting vehicles, running in slack periods, would be exempted.
Earmarking toll revenue to modernise networks
Member States would be required to invest at least 15% of HGV road toll revenue in Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T), particularly rail and water haulage. They would pledge to use the remainder to fund transport infrastructure improvements and report back to the Commission.
Opposition from certain Member States and MEPs from peripheral countries which would be hardest hit by road transport price hikes nonetheless remains strong. The change would need to be backed by 369 MEPs (a qualified majority), in Tuesday's second-reading vote.
A press conference with rapporteur Said El Khadraoui (S&D, BE) and Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas will take place after the vote.

Vote on Bulgaria and Romania bid to join Schengen area
2011-06-01 - 18:37
Parliament will assess whether Bulgaria and Romania are ready to join the Schengen border check-free zone. The Civil Liberties Committee says they are, but also stresses that Parliament must be kept informed of additional measures to be taken in the Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece area to deal with any surge in migration pressure. Parliament's opinion on whether Bulgaria and Romania should join the Schengen area will be put to a vote on Wednesday 8 June, ahead of the 9-10 Justice and Home Affairs Council, which is to discuss the issue. The key condition for joining Schengen under current rules is the ability to ensure the security of EU’s external borders.
The few remaining issues to do with Bulgaria's land borders with Turkey and Greece - one of the EU's most sensitive external border areas, which will require regular reporting and further attention in the future - do not constitute an obstacle to full Schengen membership, said the Civil Liberties Committee on 2 May.
Checking that new members have met all Schengen requirements (control of land, sea and air borders, issuing visas, police co-operation, readiness to connect to and use the Schengen Information System and data protection), is a prerequisite for the Council of Ministers to decide, after consulting Parliament, to abolish checks at internal borders with those Member States.

Parliament's priorities for reforming credit rating agency rules will be put to the vote on Tuesday, some weeks before the Commission tables the draft legislation.

More than GDP
2011-06-01 - 18:37
Gross Domestic Product has long been the top measure of a country's economic performance but it does not fully reflect its people's well-being or the sustainability of its use of resources. MEP will vote on texts designed to ensure that social and environmental factors are taken into account. Draft legislation on "environmental economic accounts", being steered through Parliament by Jo Leinen (S&D, DE), would direct Member States to improving their auditing and reporting of their use of natural resources, both to the EU statistical office Eurostat, and to the general public.
A non-binding "Beyond GDP" resolution, drafted by Anna Rosbach (ECR, DK), backs this plan and also a Commission proposal to take better account of social indicators. Both reports underline that a broader base for understanding our economies is fundamental to improving policymaking.

Disproportionate use of the European Arrest Warrant
2011-06-01 - 18:37
MEPs will quiz the Council and Commission Wednesday on how they plan to put an end to "disproportionate" use of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). Some MEPs worry that the EAW is used to prosecute minor offenders, such as pig rustlers or bicycle thieves, despite the high cost of proceedings, and that it may even breach fundamental rights. EU Member States issued 54,689 EAWs between 2005 and 2009, leading to 11,630 suspects being surrendered. The EAW's reputation has been tarnished by reports that it is being used for questioning, instead of prosecution and execution of sentences as intended. MEPs will also raise concerns about inadequate legal representation, the lack of an effective right to challenge an EAW and poor prison conditions.
European Commission figures suggest that Poland is the EU Member State most eager to issue EAWs, with 4,844 in 2009 compared to the UK's 220. Some, such as Germany and the UK, receive many more than they issue, which suggests that they may be keenest to introduce a proportionality test. Germany received 13,400 in 2009, but issued just 2,400. The number issued by the UK amounted to less than 6% of the number it received.

EU-Canada free trade deal to be debated
2011-06-01 - 18:37
Seal product trade, extracting oil from tar sands, intellectual property rights and public procurement are the most controversial issues in current negotiations for an ambitious EU-Canada trade deal. MEPs will debate progress to date with the Commission on Monday and pass a resolution on Tuesday. International Trade Committee MEPs take a favourable view of the proposed Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada, but still have concerns as to how provincial and territorial authorities would be bound by public procurement rules and how intellectual property right enforcement could affect the production of generic medicines. They will also ask whether plans to extract oil from tar sands and a WTO dispute panel settlement on the EU's seal import ban could affect the outcome of negotiations.

Hankiss parliamentary immunity case
2011-06-01 - 18:37
A request to lift the parliamentary immunity of Hungarian MEP Ágnes Hankiss, accused of defamation, will put to a vote on Tuesday. The Legal Affairs Committee recommends waiving her immunity, since the events in question took place in 2004, before Ms Hankiss was elected as an MEP in July 2009. The case does not concern her political activities as an MEP. In February 2004, a private plaintiff brought charges against Ms Hankiss for allegedly defaming the memory of the plaintiff's late father, in a TV programme broadcast on 23 January 2004. Lengthy court proceedings followed and finally, in November 2009, the Hungarian Supreme Court instructed the Buda Central District Court to reopen the case.

Court of Auditors: vote on Hans Gustaf Wessberg's candidature
2011-06-01 - 18:37
Hans Gustaf Wessberg's nomination to replace Lars Heikensten as Sweden's member of the European Court of Auditors will be put to a plenary vote on Tuesday 7 June. When the Budgetary Control Committee interviewed Mr Wessberg on 24 May, MEPs praised his past performance in both the private and public sectors but were also worried by his lack of experience in auditing and claims that he had been involved in alleged manipulations of votes within his party.
The committee nonetheless backed his candidature with 8 votes in favour, 3 against and 11 abstentions. The formal decision to appoint him would be taken by the Council of Ministers, after Parliament's vote. Mr Wessberg would serve for the remainder of Sweden's mandate, i.e. until March 2012.
