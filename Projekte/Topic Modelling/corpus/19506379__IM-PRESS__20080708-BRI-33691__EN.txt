Telecoms package
Better protection for users' rights
Access to the European emergency number 112 via electronic communications, more transparent information on access and use of content on internet as well as on operators' tariffs, portable numbers when changing operator and a clearer definition of the principle of network neutrality: these are the main points of the report proposed by the EP Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection as part of the "telecoms package". MEPs will vote during the September II sitting (22-25 September)
EU-wide spectrum management for full benefits of wireless services
Radio spectrum use must be co-ordinated and harmonised across the EU to enable citizens to benefit from new electronic services like mobile broadband internet access, says the Industry Committee. In reports for the committee, MEPs advocate setting up a new European body of national telecommunications regulators to ensure that measures apply consistently EU wide and also call for incentives to invest in new infrastructure, including "next generation" access networks.
MEPs to call for coordinated use of "digital dividend" spectrum
The use of spectrum frequencies released by the switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial TV should be coordinated at EU level, says a report proposed by the Industry Committee. MEPs call on Member States and Commission to identify common spectrum sub-bands to avoid interferences. The freed spectrum could be used for additional TV programmes, mobile broadband and new e-services such as e-government or e-health. MEPs will vote during the September II sitting (22-25 September)
***
Social package - including health facility and discrimination directive
MEPs will debate the Commission's proposed social package which was launched on 2nd and 3rd July. Altogether, the package contains 19 initiatives in the areas of employment and social affairs, education and youth, health, information society and economic affairs. John BOWIS (EPP-ED, UK), has been appointed the European Parliament's rapporteur on the new EU directive on cross-border healthcare.
Equality of men and women in the EU in 2008: quality jobs
More effort is needed to boost the quality of jobs and reduce violence against women, says an own-initiative report on equality of men and women in the EU, the first to cover all 27 EU Member States, proposed in the Women's Rights Committee.
Stereotypes in advertising continue despite EU efforts
Eva-Britt SVENSSON (GUE/NGL, SE) for the Women's Rights Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between men and women. The report notes the continued widespread existence of male and female stereotypes despite various Community programmes to promote gender equality.
McCann inspired written declaration on emergency cooperation in recovering missing children to be formally adopted
The written declaration on emergency cooperation in recovering missing children, inspired by the disappearance of Madeline McCann on 3 May 2007, will be formally adopted in plenary with 418 MEP signatures . More than half of the total of 785 MEPs need to sign a written declaration for it to become the official position of the European Parliament.
Dublin system for asylum applications - MEP say detention should be last resort
Jean LAMBERT (Greens/EFA , UK) will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the Dublin system which asks the Commission to add a provision restricting the detention of Dublin claimants to a measure of last resort, thereby specifying the grounds on which detention may be employed and the procedural safeguards which should be provided for. The “Dublin system” aims to determine which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application lodged by a third-country national on the territory of one of the Member States of the EU, Norway and Iceland (the territorial scope of the Dublin system has been extended to Switzerland, through an international agreement, which is until now only provisionally applicable).
Call for tougher EU sanctions policy
The House will debate and vote on a draft report by the Foreign Affairs Committee calling for the EU’s use of sanctions as a foreign policy instrument to be beefed up. Member States should enforce more strictly the current EU policy of targeting sanctions at leaders of oppressive regimes, say MEPs in the subcommittee. The committee vote produced a split over certain issues, including the blacklisting of terrorism-linked individuals and organisations.
Cloning of animals for food supply - EP to vote on a resolution and quiz Commission
Neil PARISH (EPP-ED, UK) on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will be asking the Commission questions on cloning of animals for food supply. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. On the initiative of its chairman, Neil Parish, the EP Agriculture Committee is calling for a ban in the EU on the cloning of animals for food supply as well as an embargo on imports of cloned animals, their offspring and products derived from these sources.
2009 budget: adequate means for EU policy priorities
The EU must give itself adequate budgetary means to achieve its policy aims - this is the spirit in which Parliament's delegation went to its budgetary conciliation meeting with the Council on 17 July. MEPs in the Budgets Committee propose increasing the payments entered in the preliminary draft budget for 2009. Responding to the plan to fund agricultural aid to developing countries with unspent CAP money, they also demanded that the Commission comply with budgetary rules.
Common frame of reference for European contract law
Klaus-Heiner LEHNE (EPP-ED, DE), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs will be asking the Commission questions on a common frame of reference for European contract law: The academic Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR) was presented to the Commission at the end of 2007. The Commission has organised several CFR workshops, and their outcomes are not reflected in the DCFR. The Commission is preparing a White Paper on a Common Frame of Reference (CFR) on the basis of selected parts of the DCFR. The CFR will greatly influence future legislative work in contract law:
Use of the Visa Information System under the Schengen Borders Code
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is proposing a report by Mihael BREJC (EPP-ED, SI) approving, subject to an amendment, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 as regards the use of the Visa Information System (VIS) under the Schengen Borders Code. The aim of the legislation is to develop an integrated border management of the EU’s borders through the adoption of common rules on the use of VIS.
The Millennium Development Goal 5 (maternal health)
MEPs will hear Commission and Council declarations on maternal health known as MDG 5. The objective of MDG 5 is to reduce by three-quarters the ratio of women dying in childbirth between 1990 and 2015. Member States are expected to renew their commitments to achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and to set out plans for action at a meeting in New York on the 25 September 2008.
Fisheries and Aquaculture in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management
The report drawn up by Ioannis GLAVAKIS (EPP-ED, EL) emphasises that the European Fisheries Fund can contribute to the long-term funding of measures within the framework of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe (ICZM) since it supports actions which contribute to the sustainable development of fishing regions.
Management of non-tuna species in the Southern Indian Ocean
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report drawn up by its chairman, Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR), on the conclusion of the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement. This new Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) will exercise its responsibilities for the effective conservation and management of non-tuna species in the high seas of the Southern Indian Ocean. The Community has fishing interests in the South Indian Ocean and is also a Coastal State on behalf of Réunion.
Progress in Council on the Framework Directive on soil protection
Miroslav OUZKÝ (EPP-ED, CZ), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will be asking the Council the following questions on progress in Council on the Framework Directive on Soil Protection. What progress has there been within the Council since the adoption of the first-reading opinion of the European Parliament and when, according to the current timetable, will the Council be able to communicate the common position to the European Parliament?
Mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is proposing an own-initiative report by Frédérique RIES (EPP-ED, BE) on the mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010. The committee acknowledges the efforts made by the Commission since the action plan was launched in 2004.
More competition in airline reservation systems - with protection for consumers
The Code of Conduct for computerised reservation systems regulates how travel bookings are managed by air carriers, the CRS companies (e.g. Amadeus and Sabre), travel agents and, where relevant, rail operators. "This code was created 20 years ago in very different market conditions than the current ones. It is now increasingly ill-adapted to new market conditions, the deregulation of other CRSs markets around the world and the decrease of airline ownership in CRSs," says EP rapporteur Timothy KIRKHOPE (EPP-ED, UK).
Guidelines urgently needed on state aid to ports, says Transport Committee
The EP Transport Committee is urging the European Commission to adopt guidelines on state aid to ports by the end of this year. In an own-initiative report on European ports policy, MEPs urge the Commission to identify possible distortions of competition and to clarify in the state aid guidelines what types of aid to port authorities should be treated as state aid. They also look at ways to upgrade the port system to meet the EU's future transport needs. The own-initiative report by Josu Ortuondo LARREA (ALDE, ES), on the Commission communication on European Ports Policy, points out that the EU port sector is expanding fast and that the maritime sector is particularly affected by globalisation.
Make freight a higher rail network priority, says Transport Committee
The European Commission should allocate at least 40% of EU transport infrastructure appropriations to the railways and prioritise freight, to reduce the need for road transport, says an own-initiative report for by the Transport Committee. MEPs urge the Commission to concentrate EU co-financing on improving the efficiency, interoperability and upgrading of rail infrastructure, inter-modal hubs and other freight transport modes. The Commission should also define "green corridors", as exemplary inter-modal projects and encourage the shift to intelligent and environmentally-friendly transport modes so as to reduce accidents, congestion, noise, local toxic and non-toxic pollution, CO2 emissions, landscape and energy consumption, suggests the report by Michael CRAMER (Greens/EFA, DE).
Developing countries growth to be boosted by opened trade in services
Pursuing both the progressive and reciprocal opening of access to the service market in trade negotiations is underlined by MEPs in a report for the International Trade Committee. This would give access to entrepreneurs of developing countries to a wider range of service. The own-initiative report reiterates that liberalisation of services is important for both developed and developing countries. The efficiency gains that could be obtained thanks to opening markets to services competition could allow less developed countries to provide a greater range of services for their citizens. The importance of universal, accessible and sustainable services with affordable prices and high-quality standards is underlined in the report drafted by Syed KAMALL (EPP-ED, UK).
Hydrogen powered motor vehicles - supply network essential say MEPs
Anja WEISGERBER (EPP-ED, DE) for the Internal Market Committee will be putting forward a legislative report on hydrogen powered motor vehicles. The committee points out that the successful introduction of hydrogen-powered vehicles on the European market will also depend on whether the appropriate hydrogen filling station network can be established in time. The Commission should, therefore, look into measures to support the establishment of a Europe-wide filling-station network for hydrogen powered vehicles.
UN level classification of hazardous substances to be incorporated into EU law
Amalia SARTORI (EPP-ED, IT) for the Environment Committee will be putting forward three legislative reports on the classification, labelling and packing of substances and mixtures. The first-reading agreement concerns the implementation of the UN level agreed, GHS (Globally Harmonised System) on classification, labelling and packaging of hazardous substances into EU legislation.
Time to get serious on tax fraud
€200-250 billion that should reach national budgets is thought to be lost to fiscal fraud. VAT fraud alone accounts for some €40 billion a year – ten per cent of the total receipts. The Economics Committee says it is time for Member States to get serious in tackling this problem and is calling for reform to the VAT system and the Savings Tax Directive. The report drawn up by Sharon BOWLES (ALDE, UK) says that some Member States have shown a “blockading attitude” in the last ten years when it comes to tackling tax fraud.
Commission should speed up infringement proceeding say MEPs
Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE) will be putting forward an own-initiative report backing a European Ombudsman special report which said that the Commission had failed to deal with the complainant's infringement complaint within a reasonable period of time and that this constituted an instance of maladministration.
Human rights in the world
As usual the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights issues in the world. On this occasion the topics are: Coup d'Etat in Mauritania, hangings in Iran, and the killing of albinos in Tanzania.

President of Costa Rica Òscar Arias to address the House
2008-08-28 - 09:51
The President of Costa Rica - Óscar Arias will address the House on Wednesday 3 September at midday. Óscar Rafael de Jesús Arias Sánchez (born 13 September 1940) is the current President of Costa Rica, and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to end civil wars then raging in several Central American countries. He is also a recipient of the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism and a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security. In 2003, he was elected to the Board of Directors of the International Criminal Court's Trust Fund for Victims.
Arias joined the National Liberation Party (PLN), Costa Rica's main social democratic party. In 1986 he ran successfully for president on that party's ticket. Arias's presidency saw the transformation of Costa Rica's economy from one based on the traditional cash crops (coffee and bananas) to one more focused on non-traditional agriculture (e.g., of exotic flowers and fruits) and tourism. Some within the PLN criticized his administration for abandoning the party's social democrat teachings and promoting a neoliberal economic model.
Arias received the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his work towards the signing of the Esquipulas II Accords. This was a plan to promote democracy and peace on the Central American isthmus during a time of great turmoil and outside influence in the midst of the Cold War. Partly due to the collapse of the Soviet-led Communist bloc that had traditionally supported leftist governments and insurgencies in Central America, the signing of the accords was indeed followed by an end to most of the fighting in Central America.
Arias then called for a higher level of integration in the Central America region and promoted the creation of the Central American Parliament (Parlamento Centroamericano). During his current administration, Arias has declared that Costa Rica will not enter the Central American Parliament. Arias also modified the country's educational system. The most notable action in this respect was the reintroduction of standardized academic tests at the end of primary and secondary school.
Second presidency
After a controversial ruling by the Constitutional Court voided an amendment to the constitution that forbade presidential re-election, Arias announced in 2004 that he intended to run again for president in the February 2006 general elections. Though for years private polling companies and several news media published polls predicting Arias would win by a wide margin, the election was initially deemed too close to call. A month later, on 7 March, after a manual recount, the official results showed Arias beat centre-left contender Ottón Solís by 18,169 votes (1.2% of valid votes cast). He took the oath of office at noon on 8 May 2006 at the National Stadium.
On 1 June 2007, he switched Costa Rica's diplomatic recognition from Taiwan (ROC) to China (PRC), making Costa Rica the 167th nation in the world to do so. Formal sitting - Costa Rica

Telecoms package: better protection for users' rights
2008-08-28 - 09:51
Access to the European emergency number 112 via electronic communications, more transparent information on access and use of content on internet as well as on operators' tariffs, portable numbers when changing operator and a clearer definition of the principle of network neutrality: these are the main points of the report proposed by the EP Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection as part of the "telecoms package". MEPs will vote during the September II sitting (22-25 September) The committee's report, drafted by Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK), on electronic communications (fixed and mobile telephony, voice over internet, internet) deals with a review of existing rules on access to networks and services and other rights of users of universal services, notably personal data and protection of privacy. Parliament's political groups had already reached a compromise on certain issues, such as access to the single European emergency number 112, access to electronic communications as a universal service, the number portability, the transparency of tariffs and prices charged and the network neutrality principle.
The aim, said Mr Harbour, is to strengthen and improve the rights of consumers who use electronic communications. Users should be able to access lawful content more easily, distribute it or use lawful applications and services of their choice. Consumers' rights to information - before signing a contract - on the tariffs charged and on any restrictions imposed by the operator (for example, limits on access to internet voice communication services or on consumer choice after a mobile phone bought at a special offer price is exchanged) should be significantly strengthened. This report does not seek to strengthen the provisions on copyright, stressed the rapporteur. Nor will it affect the idea of a universal service, which will soon be the subject of separate legislation.
More information on privacy
Under the text proposed by the EP committee, operators must keep their subscribers informed of any possible restrictions on access, use or distribution of content, services and lawful applications. For example, a mobile phone operator who prevents access to internet voice communications via "smart" telephones would have to specify this at the outset. In addition, access providers would have to warn internet users of the risk of malicious use of their personal data or other illegal practices.
According to the EP Civil Liberties Committee, which is responsible for these matters, it is up to the national authorities to identify any infringements, including breaches of intellectual property rights, then to ask the internet access provider to warn the user. The committee's opinion, drafted by Alexander Alvaro (ALDE, DE) and adopted on 25 June, also calls for the gathering of data from a computer (e.g. setting web browser parameters to accept cookies) to require prior consent from the user.
More transparent and comparable tariffs, making it easier to switch operators
According to the Internal Market Committee report, operators should provide users with transparent, comparable, appropriate and up to date information on prices and tariffs, charges for terminating a contract and general terms and conditions. The aim is to enable end users independently to assess the cost of switching operators. Consumers armed with interactive guides or similar tools should thus be cable to take advantage of the liberalised telecoms market by choosing, in full knowledge of the facts, the operators who best meet their needs. Improving number portability should moreover make it possible to switch operators within a single day.
Making life easier for elderly and handicapped people, extending access to the emergency number
Since 2002, it has been possible to call the 112 emergency number throughout the EU. MEPs feel that this number should be accessible irrespective of the type of electronic communication used. The emergency services should also have easy access to information needed to locate the caller. Some operators specialising in voice over internet protocol (VOIP) communications have questioned the technical feasibility of such measures, but MEPs felt that the technical constraints are surmountable. All facilities should moreover be entirely accessible to elderly and handicapped people. Users everywhere in the EU should also have access to telephone directory services.
Availability of services and content
The strictest possible application of "network neutrality" would preclude discrimination to do with the use and distribution of internet content, applications or services. The report sets out provisions to do with this principle in order to enhance service quality. The draft directive lists a series of reasons that might justify intervention by a national regulator. These include a decline in standards of service, a slowing of traffic, but also protecting the rights and freedoms of other network users or of operators to diversify their offerings in a competitive market. Any restriction should nonetheless be clearly notified to users and national regulatory authorities should draw up guides for users and operators to define the minimum standard of service supplied.

Telecoms package: EU-wide spectrum management for full benefits of wireless services
2008-08-28 - 09:51
Radio spectrum use must be co-ordinated and harmonised across the EU to enable citizens to benefit from new electronic services like mobile broadband internet access, says the Industry Committee. In reports for the committee, MEPs advocate setting up a new European body of national telecommunications regulators to ensure that measures apply consistently EU wide and also call for incentives to invest in new infrastructure, including "next generation" access networks. The European Parliament will vote during the September II plenary sitting (22-25 September).
Spectrum owned by Member States is needed for many wireless services, from broadcasting and mobile TV through mobile communications and broadband internet to new electronic services such as e-government or e-health. To optimise frequency use and avoid harmful interference among services, Member States must co-operate with each other and the Commission in the strategic planning, co-ordination and harmonisation of radio spectrum use, says the report by Catherine TRAUTMANN (PES, FR).
The electronic communications framework directive, as amended by the Industry Committee, therefore asks the Commission to table a legislative proposal to establish a "radio spectrum action programme".
The committee calls for a more coherent and integrated approach to allocating "digital dividend" frequencies freed up by the switchover from analogue to digital TV, to be completed by 2012.
Manage spectrum flexibly, but safeguard media pluralism
The draft directive, as amended, would require Member States to ensure that any technology or any service can use any frequency available for electronic communications services, in line with national frequency allocation plans and with the International Telecommunication Union's Radio Regulations. Measures requiring that a service be supplied in a specific frequency band would have to be justified by reference to general interest aims such as ensuring safety of life, promoting social, regional or territorial cohesion, avoiding inefficient use of radio frequencies, or promoting cultural and media aims such as cultural and linguistic diversity and media pluralism, say MEPs in the committee.
Ensure fair competition by applying regulatory measures consistently in all Member States
The Industry Committee also proposes a report by Pilar DEL CASTILLO VERA (EPP-ED, ES) which proposes setting up a Body of European Regulators in Telecommunications (BERT) , composed of the 27 national regulatory authorities, as an alternative to the European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA) advocated by the Commission.
MEPs in the committee propose a new "co-regulation" procedure which would require national regulatory authorities consult the Commission and BERT before taking regulatory decisions. The Commission may require the national regulatory authority to amend the draft measure if BERT considers the measure inappropriate or ineffective.
Separating network access products from other services seen as "an exceptional measure" to promote competition
A national regulator may, as "an exceptional measure", require telecom operators to separate their network access products from other services - known as "functional separation" - by creating a separate business unit to run the network access services. This unit should then provide all network user firms with access products and services on equal terms. However, the national regulator may apply this remedy only if both the Commission and BERT confirm that no other measure has achieved effective competition and that, without the remedy, there is little prospect of future infrastructure-based competition.
Promote investment in next-generation access networks
MEPs in the committee also advocate "appropriate incentives for investments in new high-speed networks that will support innovation in content-rich internet services and strengthen European international competitiveness". These "next generation access networks", using fibre optics, will provide ubiquitous and converged service infrastructure for electronic communications, computing and media.
The Industry Committee asks national regulators to promote market-driven investment and innovation in new and enhanced infrastructures, for example by encouraging investment sharing and by ensuring appropriate risk-sharing among the investor and firms wanting access to new facilities.
Funding BERT
BERT should be funded by the Community (one third) and by direct contributions from national regulatory authorities (two thirds), according to an amendment adopted by the committee. However, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs agreed to review these funding provisions ahead of the plenary vote.
Keep BERT and ENISA separate
BERT should not take over tasks relating to network and information security, says the amended proposal. The Commission had originally proposed merging the existing European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) with the new European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA). However, the European Parliament has already prolonged ENISA's mandate until March 2012, in a vote at the June plenary session.
BERT's mandate should be reviewed by 1 January 2014, to ascertain whether it needs to be extended, say MEPs.

Industry
MEPS to call for coordinated use of "digital dividend" spectrum
2008-08-28 - 09:51
The use of spectrum frequencies released by the switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial TV should be coordinated at EU level, says a report proposed by the Industry Committee. MEPs call on Member States and Commission to identify common spectrum sub-bands to avoid interferences. The freed spectrum could be used for additional TV programmes, mobile broadband and new e-services such as e-government or e-health. MEPs will vote during the September II sitting (22-25 September) Digitisation allows the transmission of 6 to 8 TV channels in the spectrum previously needed for one analogue channel alone. A study commissioned by Parliament estimates that the switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial TV by the end of 2012 will thus free up around 75% of high-quality spectrum, known as the "digital dividend".
"The immediacy of switchover in some Member States and the differences in national switchover plans require a response at Community level that cannot wait until the reform directives [of the telecoms package] enter into force", says the own-initiative report drafted by Patrizia TOIA (ALDE, IT).
Promote new e-services and media pluralism
The report advocates "a common and balanced approach to the use of the digital dividend", which allows broadcasters to expand their services and electronic communications operators to deploy new services. In any event, the digital dividend should be allocated in a technology-neutral fashion, say MEPs in the committee.
MEPs in the committee stress that around 100 MHz of the digital dividend could be reallocated to mobile broadband and other services such as public safety services, radio frequency identification (RFID), and road safety applications, without preventing broadcasting services from flourishing.
The released spectrum can for example improve the provision of enhanced interoperable social services such as e-government, e-health, e-vocational training and e-education to citizens, especially those living in less favoured and isolated areas, says the report. At the same time, the digital dividend will enable public and private broadcasters to provide a much larger number of programmes serving general interest objectives such as the promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity, stress MEPs in the committee.
A coordinated approach at EU level
The report urges Member States to release their digital dividends as quickly as possible, "to allow European citizens to benefit from the deployment of new, innovative and competitive services". Following a common methodology, Member States should develop national digital dividend strategies by the end of 2009.
The Industry Committee calls on the Commission to propose measures to Parliament and Council for better coordinating the use of the digital dividend at EU level. Member States, together with the Commission, should identify common spectrum sub-bands of the digital dividend for different application clusters that could be harmonised on a technology-neutral basis, it says. MEPs reason that a coordinated approach, based on different clusters of the UHF spectrum for uni-directional and bi-directional services, is "the most efficient way to avoid harmful interference".
Unlicensed access
Member States should also recognise the value of allowing unlicensed users access to the dividend, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and the not-for-profit sector, says the report, because unlicensed access would allow new technologies and services to emerge. Unlicensed uses of the spectrum should concentrate in the currently unused frequencies, also known as "white spaces".
Common conditions for auctioning frequencies
Member States should also agree on a common approach as regards the conditions and modalities for auctioning the frequencies freed by the switchover and the allocation of the generated resources, say MEPs in the committee.

Social policy
Social package - including health facility and discrimination directive
2008-08-28 - 09:51
MEPs will debate the Commission's proposed social package which was launched on 2nd and 3rd July. Altogether, the package contains 19 initiatives in the areas of employment and social affairs, education and youth, health, information society and economic affairs. Discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation outside the field of employment
The Commission is, for example, proposing legislation to fill the gaps of the existing legal framework and to protect against discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation outside the field of employment. This new directive would ensure equal treatment in the areas of social protection, including social security and health care, education and access to and supply of goods and services which are commercially available to the public, including housing.
The law will prohibit direct and indirect discrimination as well as harassment and victimisation. For people with disabilities, non-discrimination will involve general accessibility as well as the principle of "reasonable accommodation" which is already used in existing European legislation.
It will, however, avoid imposing a disproportionate burden on service providers by taking account of the size and resources of the organisation, its nature, the estimated cost, the life cycle of the goods and services and the possible benefits of increased access for persons with disabilities. The directive will only apply to private persons in so far as they are performing their commercial or professional activities. Also, Member States will remain free to maintain measures ensuring the secular nature of the State or concerning the status and activities of religious organisations. The directive will have no effect on generally accepted practices such as discounts for senior citizens (e.g. bus fares and entrance to museums) or age restrictions on access to certain goods (e.g. alcohol for young people) on grounds of public health.
Patients' access to healthcare
NB. This part of the package will be debated during the second September plenary (22-25 September in Strasbourg)
Another legislative proposal contained in the package aims to facilitate patients' access to healthcare in other European countries. Despite several clear European Court of Justice rulings confirming that the EU Treaty gives individual patients the right to seek healthcare in other Member States and be reimbursed at home, uncertainty remains over how to apply the principles of this jurisprudence more generally. With this proposal the Commission aims to provide legal certainty on this issue. This follows calls from both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers for the Commission to propose a specific initiative on cross-border healthcare, in a way explicitly adapted to, and respecting, the unique nature of the healthcare sector. John BOWIS (EPP-ED, UK), has been appointed the European Parliament's rapporteur on the new EU directive on cross-border healthcare.
The directive's goals:
Overall, this directive, once adopted by the Council and the European Parliament, will provide a clear framework for cross-border care. Under its major provisions:
Patients have the right to seek healthcare abroad and be reimbursed up to what they would have received at home. The directive will provide clarity over how these rights can be exercised, including the limits that Member States can place on such healthcare abroad, and the level of financial coverage that is provided for cross-border healthcare.
Member States are responsible for healthcare provided on their territory. Patients should be confident that the quality and safety standards of the treatment they will receive in another Member State are regularly monitored and based on good medical practices.
The directive will facilitate European cooperation on healthcare. It will provide a basis to support the development of European reference networks, which will bring together, on a voluntary basis, specialised centres in different Member States. This collaboration has great potential to bring benefits to patients through easier access to highly specialised care. It can also be useful to health systems as it would facilitate the efficient use of resources, for example by pooling resources to tackle rare conditions.
Health technology assessment is another clear area of European added-value. This initiative will help to reduce overlap and duplication of efforts in this field and hence promote the effective and efficient use of resources.
Activities in the field of "e-Health" will also be strengthened. Information and communication technologies have enormous potential to improve the quality, safety and efficiency of healthcare. The Commission already supports existing e-health projects covering areas such as remote provision of specialist support from large hospitals to smaller local facilities. What is lacking, however, are shared formats and standards that can be used between different systems and different countries. The directive will help these to be put in place.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Equality of men and women in the EU in 2008: quality jobs
2008-08-28 - 09:51
More effort is needed to boost the quality of jobs and reduce violence against women, says an own-initiative report on equality of men and women in the EU, the first to cover all 27 EU Member States, proposed in the Women's Rights Committee. MEPs in the committee welcome a European Commission report on the same subject and back a twin-track approach to equality of the sexes, which on the one hand ensures equality between men and women in all EU policy areas and on the other puts in place targeted measures to reduce discrimination. The report by Iratxe García Pérez (PES, ES) also underlines the importance of combating violence against women in the context of equality of the sexes.
Qualitative challenges
Although quantitative progress in women's employment is undeniable - the female employment rate has risen each year to 57.2%, i.e. 3.5 points higher than in 2000, qualitative progress remains problematic.
The male-female wage gap in the EU has remained steady at 15% since 2003, and sector-specific and job-specific segregation is not declining - in some countries, it is increasing. The proportion of company directors who are women is stagnating at 33%, and in politics, 23% of national MPs and 33% of MEPs are women.
More effort is also needed to reconcile family and professional life, say MEPs, noting a substantial decline in the employment rate of women with young children (down 13.6 points on average). Furthermore, three quarters (76.5%) of part-time workers are women.
Wage inequalities
MEPs in the committee are "worried" by the lack of progress in closing wage gaps between men and women. They back the proposal by the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities to strengthen EU legislation by requiring employers to do wage audits and develop action plans to reduce the wage gap. They also call on Community institutions and Member States to declare 22 February an "international wage equality day".
Women's participation in decision-taking
MEPs in the committee consider that the participation of women in decision-taking at local, national and European levels is inadequate. They call on the Commission, Member States and political parties to "envisage positive action to improve the situation". The report also notes that the use of electoral quotas has had a positive impact on the representation of women.
Reconciling family and professional life
Among the measures proposed to reconcile family and professional life, MEPs in the committee propose improving the framework agreement on parental leave by introducing incentives for fathers to take it, strengthening the rights of workers taking parental leave and making the rules on the duration of parental leave and payment more flexible.
Violence against women
Violence against women is a major obstacle to equality between men and women and is the most widespread human rights violation, say MEPs in the committee, who call on the Commission and the Council to put in place a clear legal basis for combating all forms of violence against women, including trafficking.
Finally, they also call on the Commission and Member States to combat organised crime and to take new measures to discourage demand for prostitution. Rapporteur Iratxe GARCÍA PÉREZ PES ES A6-0325/2008 Equality between women and men - 2008 Procedure : own-initiative

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Stereotypes in advertising continue despite EU efforts
2008-08-28 - 09:51
Eva-Britt SVENSSON (GUE/NGL, SE) for the Women's Rights Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between men and women. The report notes the continued widespread existence of male and female stereotypes despite various Community programmes to promote gender equality. Incitement and the media
The report calls on the EU institutions to monitor the implementation of existing provisions in European law on sex discrimination and incitement to hatred on the grounds of sex.
MEPs in the committee call on the EU institutions and Member States to develop awareness actions on zero-tolerance across the EU for sexist insults or degrading images of women in the media.
The report calls on Member States to establish national media monitoring bodies with a specific gender equality branch and expertise in order to receive complaints from the public, to grant gender equality awards to media and advertisement professionals, to study and report on the question of women in the media and to carry out regular, systematic monitoring of gender images in media content.
Women as objects
MEPs in the committee note with extreme concern the advertising of sexual services, which reinforce stereotypes of women as objects, in publications, such as local newspapers, which are readily visible and available to children.
The committee draws attention to the report entitled "Eating Disorders, Body Image and the Media" published in 2000 by the British Medical Association and notes that media portrayals of the ideal body image can adversely effect the self-esteem of women, particularly teenagers and those susceptible to eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.
Extremely thin women
The report recommends that broadcasters, magazine publishers and advertisers adopt a more responsible editorial attitude towards the depiction of extremely thin women as role models and portray a more realistic range of body images and calls on advertisers in particular to consider more carefully their use of extremely thin women to advertise products.
Prize for equality in all Member States
The report also emphasises the need for good examples from a gender perspective in the media and advertising world in order to show that change is possible and desirable. The committee considers that all Member States should, like Spain, which has established a prize for 'creating equality', make official the award of a prize by advertisers to members of their own industry, and a prize awarded by the public, to reward advertising which best breaks with gender stereotypes and presents a positive or status-enhancing image of women, men or relations between them.

Budget
2009 budget: adequate means for EU policy priorities
2008-08-28 - 09:51
The EU must give itself adequate budgetary means to achieve its policy aims - this is the spirit in which Parliament's delegation went to its budgetary conciliation meeting with the Council on 17 July. MEPs in the Budgets Committee propose increasing the payments entered in the preliminary draft budget for 2009. Responding to the plan to fund agricultural aid to developing countries with unspent CAP money, they also demanded that the Commission comply with budgetary rules. "We need an EU budget for our citizens", declared Jutta Haug (PES, DE), EP rapporteur on the EU's 2009 general budget. "This means it is not sufficient to give only political answers. These answers need to be backed with the necessary financial resources, e.g. to tackle climate change, to ensure energy security and sustainable growth and to secure food aid", she said, adding after the conciliation meeting that the cuts made by the Council are "unrealistic".
Payments down
Although Parliament and the Council, the two branches of the budgetary authority, disagree on funding, they nonetheless agree on the priorities: support for creating jobs, pursuing cohesion policy, promoting research into clean and efficient energies, defining a European energy policy to achieve security and independence, putting in place a European area of justice and a common integration policy, action in the Middle East, Kosovo and the Balkans, food aid and strengthening environmental measures in the development co-operation context and, of course, policies having a direct impact on citizens' daily lives.
MEPs doubt whether the amounts proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget (PDB) will suffice to achieve these aims. They consider payment appropriations (€ 116.7 billion - down from €121.5 billion in the 2008 PDB) to be "extremely narrow" already and the even lower amount proposed by the Council delegation (€114.9 billion) still less adequate.
External questions
Heading 4 ("The EU as a global player") will be the biggest stumbling block in negotiations between Parliament and the Council. The Commission itself has acknowledged that the appropriations entered in the PDB for Kosovo, the Middle East, food aid and macro-financial assistance will doubtless be insufficient.
For example, the Commission has entered only € 161 million in commitment appropriations and €100 million in payments for Palestine, down from €300 million and €200 million respectively in 2008. The Council delegation does propose an extra €100 million, "to anticipate the Commission's letter of amendment", whilst admitting that this is not enough. However, these are only reserve commitment appropriations, which Parliament deems "unsatisfactory".
Given that needs are growing and even the 2008 appropriations have turned out to be insufficient, MEPs consider these estimates unrealistic. Parliament's rapporteur for the 2008 budget, Kyosti Virrankoski (ALDE, FI), pointed out that "in spring alone the initial amounts had to be increased by €190 million, collected from 13 different lines, always to the detriment of other policy aims". Several amendments to the budget so far have increased spending for Palestine to € 340 million. Compared with previous budgets, which already chronically underfunded heading 4, the 2009 one is likely to offer even less room for manœuvre.
Fisheries and agricultural aid to developing countries
Parliament's delegation stressed the absolute necessity, particularly in this pre-election period, of clearly and realistically stating the sources of funding for any decision that has budgetary implications.
In the absence of support from the Council, Parliament made a unilateral statement in which it reiterates that any funding of new measures must comply with the principles set out in the Financial Regulation and in the 2006 inter-institutional agreement.
Parliament is surprised, for example, by the latest Fisheries Council decision, which would release a € 600 million aid even though neither the source of the funding nor its legal basis are clearly established. To ensure that the budget is realistic and transparent, Parliament has also asked the Commission to evaluate the budgetary impact of political undertakings set out in the conclusions of the Council meeting of 19 and 20 June 2008.
On the fringe of the 2009 budget negotiations, MEPs also raised the issue of funding for agricultural aid for developing countries. To meet such commitments, the Union should first use the European Development Fund (EDF), and perhaps appropriations under heading 4, said EP delegation chair Reimer Böge (EPP-ED, DE). But the Commission proposes to use for this purpose € 1 billion in unspent funds from heading 2 (natural resources) in financial 2008-2009.
Mr Böge believes that this proposal would breach the 2006 inter-institutional agreement and financial perspective. "We are ready to negotiate quickly and appropriately all possibilities for funding new challenges, whether in development policy, measures against climate change or foreign affairs and security policy", he said.
Citizenship and the "Lisbon lines"
The €22 million margin proposed in sub-heading 3b of the PDB is too narrow to provide sufficient room for manœuvre for pilot projects and preparatory actions. The reduction in payments under heading 1b (cohesion for growth and employment) was also criticized by the EP.
Agencies
Lastly, the institutions agreed on a series of statements on various questions. Another, on agencies, was presented unilaterally by Parliament. The two institutions both welcome an initiative to evaluate regulatory agencies, but Member States did not back Parliament's proposal that the institutions form an inter-institutional working group to assess together what decisions should follow this evaluation. Furthermore, both Parliament and the Commission expressed concern about a substantial reduction in funds earmarked for creating 250 new posts as a consequence of the latest enlargement.

Human rights
Call for tougher EU sanctions policy
2008-08-28 - 09:51
The House will debate and vote on a draft report by the Foreign Affairs Committee calling for the EU’s use of sanctions as a foreign policy instrument to be beefed up. Member States should enforce more strictly the current EU policy of targeting sanctions at leaders of oppressive regimes, say MEPs in the subcommittee. The committee vote produced a split over certain issues, including the blacklisting of terrorism-linked individuals and organisations. The own-initiative report - which is a general review of EU sanctions policy - was drafted by Hélène Flautre (Greens/EFA, FR), chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee, and adopted on 7 July by the Foreign Affairs Committee, by 26 votes to 2, with 17 abstentions. Among the abstentions were PES and Green Members, including Mrs Flautre herself.
Human rights clause: sanctions in cases of wilful damage to the environment?
The draft report states that the EP welcomes the systematic inclusion of "human rights clauses" in all new EU bilateral agreements (trade accords etc.) with third countries but calls for them to be implemented more stringently (the agreements can in principle be suspended if governments violate human rights). It also suggests adding "voluntary and irreversible degradation of the environment" by authorities to the grounds for imposing sanctions.
Targeted sanctions must be enforced
Apart from the "human rights clauses", the EU can and does support UN sanctions, and it can impose its own measures in pursuit of foreign policy goals such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
Since economic sanctions can cause great suffering to a country's population, the EU has shifted towards "targeted sanctions" aimed at regime leaders, such as the freezing of bank accounts and travel and visa bans. The draft report backs this type of action but demands it be more strictly observed, with "a concerted approach" by Member States.
The committee wants measures against EU-based economic operators who flout sanctions. It also deplores the use of "sunset clauses" providing for sanctions to be lifted automatically. But it would allow "humanitarian exemptions" to sanctions, such as access to medical care.
Use of blacklists in the fight against terrorism
The "blacklisting" of individuals and organisations as part of the fight against terrorism is a sensitive topic that divides MEPs. Some underline its usefulness while others stress the need not to trample on the basic rights of individuals and organisations.
Thanks to support from EPP-ED Members but against the wishes of the PES and others, the draft report states that "the system of anti-terrorist lists", provided it respects the law, is "one of the pillars of European Union anti-terrorist policy". It urges Council and Commission "to support the existing procedure for blacklisting and delisting" so as to respect the "human rights of EU citizens, especially the right to life, liberty and security of person".
At the same time, the report "regrets that none of the judicial bodies is in a position to assess the appropriateness of blacklisting, given that the evidence leading to blacklisting is based primarily on information held by the secret services". MEPs are keen that "this fundamental discretion should not be transformed into impunity" and call for effective parliamentary control over the work of the secret services, including a role for the EP.
Robert Mugabe
The report points out that the credibility of the EU and its individual Member States is compromised when EU sanctions appear to be or actually are broken, pointing out that Robert Mugabe was invited to attend the EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon on 8-9 December 2007 despite having been formally banned from all territories of EU Member States.
Allegations of double standards
Lastly, MEPs deplore "the fact that the EU has often applied its sanctions policy inconsistently, by treating third countries differently even though their human rights and democratic records are similar, and thus triggering criticism for applying 'double standards'".

Cloning of animals for food supply - EP to vote on a resolution and quiz Commission
2008-08-28 - 09:51
Neil PARISH (EPP-ED, UK) on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will be asking the Commission questions on cloning of animals for food supply. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic. On the initiative of its chairman, Neil Parish (EPP-ED, UK), the EP Agriculture Committee is calling for a ban in the EU on the cloning of animals for food supply as well as an embargo on imports of cloned animals, their offspring and products derived from these sources.
In a draft resolution, the committee calls on the Commission "to submit proposals prohibiting:
the cloning of animals for food supply purposes,
the farming of cloned animals or their offspring,
the placing on the market of meat or dairy products derived from cloned animals or their offspring, and
the importing of cloned animals, their offspring, semen and embryos from cloned animals or their offspring, and meat or dairy products derived from cloned animals or their offspring."
This text highlights the reservations voiced by several groups of European experts, particularly about the health of cloned animals. In a preliminary opinion delivered in January 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) pinpointed the issues of health, welfare and mortality, which are more acute in this type of animal. For its part, the European Group on Ethics said around the same time that it did not see convincing arguments to justify food production from clones and their offspring, given that current levels of suffering and health problems of surrogate dams and animal clones made this technique ethically questionable.
MEPs in the committee also stress that cloning would significantly reduce genetic diversity within livestock populations, increasing the possibility of whole herds being decimated by diseases to which they are susceptible and that this could harm the image of the European agricultural model, which is based on product quality, environment-friendly principles and respect for stringent animal welfare conditions. They also point out that Directive 98/58/EC on the protection of farm animals bans natural or artificial procedures which are likely to cause suffering or injury to any of the animals concerned must not be practised.
Currently no products derived from cloned animals are sold in Europe or the rest of the world. However, experts believe that such products could reach the market by 2010. A moratorium on the sale of this type of product, introduced in the USA in 2001, was challenged by the US Food and Drug Administration, which concluded in January that meat and milk from clones of cattle, pigs and goats and their offspring are as reliable as those of traditionally bred animals.
In parallel to the vote on this draft resolution, MEPs also adopted a batch of oral questions on animal cloning to which the European Commission will have to reply at the plenary session. MEPs wish to know the Commission's position and any plans it has on this matter.
Oral questions
Directive 98/58/EC states that ‘Natural or artificial breeding or breeding procedures which cause or are likely to cause suffering or injury to any of the animals concerned must not be practised’. The Protocol on protection and welfare of animals requires the Community and Member States to pay full regard to animal welfare requirements when formulating and implementing agriculture and research policies.
1. Does the Commission share the view that cloning adversely affects animal welfare and will significantly reduce genetic diversity within livestock populations, increasing the possibility of whole herds being decimated by diseases to which they are susceptible?
2. Can the Commission provide long-term animal welfare and health indications for clones and their offspring?
3. What has the Commission done to date in order to inform consumers and promote public discussion on animal cloning and its potential implications (infringements of animal health and welfare standards, human health and safety, impact on biodiversity, etc.)?

McCann inspired written declaration on emergency cooperation in recovering missing children to be formally adopted
2008-08-28 - 09:51
The written declaration on emergency cooperation in recovering missing children, inspired by the disappearance of Madeline McCann on 3 May 2007, will be formally adopted in plenary with 418 MEP signatures . More than half of the total 785 MEPs need to sign a written declaration for it to become the official position of the European Parliament. The written declaration brought forward by Edward MCMILLAN-SCOTT (EPP-ED, UK), Roberta ANGELILLI (UEN, IT), Glenys KINNOCK (PES, UK), Evelyne GEBHARDT (PES, DE) and Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK) calls on Member States to introduce a missing child alert system, the activation of which would require the immediate forwarding to the relevant news media, border authorities and customs and law enforcement agencies of details of:
– the missing child, with a photograph if available
– information relevant to the disappearance and/or the suspected abductor(s)
– a telephone number to call with information (116 000 where operational).
The declaration calls on the Member States to reach cooperation agreements with all bordering states to ensure the capacity to raise an alert rapidly across any relevant territories.
The declaration calls for the development of a common organisation to provide assistance and training to national bodies and points out that there is no Europe-wide alert system for child disappearances nor any local or national systems throughout much of the European Union.
The declaration, together with the names of the signatories, is now forwarded to the Commission and the Council. Written declaration on emergency cooperation in recovering missing children

Dublin system for asylum applications - MEP say detention should be last resort
2008-08-28 - 09:51
Jean LAMBERT (Greens/EFA, UK) will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the Dublin system which asks the Commission to add a provision restricting the detention of Dublin claimants to a measure of last resort, thereby specifying the grounds on which detention may be employed and the procedural safeguards which should be provided for. Overview of Dublin regulation evaluation
The Dublin regulation establishes the criteria and mechanisms to determine the member state responsible for examining an application for asylum. The report to be voted on next Tuesday is an evaluation of the original regulation which was adopted in 2003. The report is a response to the evaluation presented by the Commission. It highlights current weaknesses in the regulation, not least the widely differing standards towards the assessment of asylum cases between member states, which undermines the regulation. The report puts forward suggestions for amendment, particularly in relation to broadening the definition of 'family member', ensuring that Dublin claimants are detained only as a measure of last resort, and addressing the need for increased responsibility sharing between Member States.
The report says that that unless a satisfactory and consistent level of protection is achieved across the EU, the Dublin System will always produce unsatisfactory results from both the technical and the human viewpoints, and asylum seekers will continue to have valid reasons for wishing to lodge their application in a specific Member State to take advantage of the most favourable national decision-making.
The “Dublin system” aims to determine which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application lodged by a third-country national on the territory of one of the Member States of the EU, Norway and Iceland (the territorial scope of the Dublin system has been extended to Switzerland, through an international agreement, which is until now only provisionally applicable). It comprises Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (the Dublin Regulation) and its Implementing Regulation and Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000 concerning the establishment of 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention (the EURODAC Regulation)and its Implementing Regulation.
Financial mechanisms
The report calls on the Commission, pending the introduction of European burden-sharing mechanisms, to consider providing for mechanisms other than financial within the Dublin Regulation to correct the adverse effects of its implementation for the smaller Member States at the Union’s external borders.
Rights of claimants
The Civil Liberties Committee calls on the Commission, pending the introduction of European burden-sharing mechanisms, to consider providing for mechanisms other than financial within the Dublin Regulation to correct the adverse effects of its implementation for the smaller Member States at the Union’s external borders.
Family reunification and the principle of the best interest of the child
The report regrets that the definition of a family member under the current Regulation is too restrictive and asks the Commission to extend the present definition to include all close relatives and long-term partners, particularly those who have no other family support, and adult children unable to care for themselves.
The committee considers that where an asylum seeker is in a particularly vulnerable state owing to a serious illness, a severe disability, old age or pregnancy, and he or she is therefore dependent on the assistance of a relative present in the territory of an Member State other than the one in charge of the examination of the application, he or she should, as far as possible, be reunited with that relative.
Data-collection and Eurodac
The committee expresses its concern at the discrepancies and deficiencies in the collection of data revealed by the Commission's evaluation of the Dublin system, especially in relation to the registering of fingerprints of illegal entrants at the borders of the Union, which casts serious doubts on the validity of the system.

Visa policy
Use of the Visa Information System under the Schengen Borders Code
2008-08-28 - 09:51
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is proposing a report by Mihael BREJC (EPP-ED, SI) approving, subject to an amendment, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 as regards the use of the Visa Information System (VIS) under the Schengen Borders Code. The aim of the legislation is to develop an integrated border management of the EU’s borders through the adoption of common rules on the use of VIS.
The only amendment proposed by the committee, under the codecision procedure, introduces a derogation to the general approach recommended by the proposal. MEPs therefore recommend that the VIS should be consulted using the number of the visa sticker only or, on a random basis, the number of the visa sticker in combination with the verification of fingerprints.
A series of conditions must be satisfied in order for this derogation to apply:
when traffic of such intensity arises that the waiting time at the border crossing point becomes excessive;
all resources have already been exhausted in terms of staff, facilities and organisation;
an assessment has been made that there is no risk related to internal security and illegal immigration.
Where there is any doubt as to the identity of the holder of the visa and/or the authenticity of the visa, the VIS shall be consulted using the number of the visa sticker in combination with the verification of fingerprints.
The decision to consult the VIS shall be taken at least at the level of the border guard in command at the border crossing point.
MEPs in the committee request that each Member State transmit once a year a report on the application of this derogation. Three years after the date of application of this Regulation, the Commission shall transmit to the European Parliament and the Council a comprehensive evaluation of this derogation. On the basis of that evaluation, the European Parliament or the Council may invite the Commission to propose appropriate amendments to the Regulation.

Common frame of reference for European contract law
2008-08-28 - 09:51
Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs will be asking the Commission the following questions on a common frame of reference for European contract law: The academic Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR) was presented to the Commission at the end of 2007. The Commission has organised several CFR workshops, and their outcomes are not reflected in the DCFR. The Commission is preparing a White Paper on a Common Frame of Reference (CFR) on the basis of selected parts of the DCFR. The CFR will greatly influence future legislative work in contract law:
1. How will the Commission ensure that the DCFR is available in the greatest number of languages, so that it is accessible to all interested stakeholders?
2. What measures has the Commission implemented to coordinate the work of all the DGs involved in the preparation of the White Paper on a CFR?
3. How will the Commission ensure that the outcome of the recently organised CFR workshops will be reflected in the White Paper?
4. Does the Commission agree that there is no need to exclude any content or materials of the DCFR should the CFR form a non-binding legislative tool?
5. Does the Commission agree that the CFR could result in an optional instrument confined to those areas where the Community legislator has been, or is likely to be, active, or which are closely linked to contract law?
6. How will the Commission involve the Parliament in any selection process?
7. How does the Commission envisage that the CFR will be kept up to date? Klaus-Heiner LEHNE EPP-ED DE Oral question Common frame of reference for European contract law Oral question - common frame of reference for European contract law

The Millennium Development Goal 5 (maternal health)
2008-08-28 - 09:51
MEPs will hear Commission and Council declarations on maternal health known as MDG 5. The objective of MDG 5 is to reduce by three-quarters the ratio of women dying in childbirth between 1990 and 2015. Member States are expected to renew their commitments to achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and to set out plans for action at a meeting in New York on the 25 September 2008. Among the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – which range from halving extreme poverty to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing universal primary education - maternal health is one where progress is slow. It is estimated that more than half a million women die in pregnancy and childbirth every year.
In September 2000, world leaders adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration, committing their countries to reduce extreme poverty by 2015. These objectives are known as the Millennium Development Goals.
More than half a million women die in pregnancy and childbirth every year - that's one death every minute. Of these deaths, 99 per cent are in developing countries. In parts of Africa, maternal mortality rates are 1 in 16. (Source:UNFPA) Only 28 in 100 women giving birth are attended by trained personnel in the least developed countries. (Source:ActionAid)
The indicators of the MDG are :
Target 5a: Reduce by three quarters the maternal mortality ratio
5.1 Maternal mortality ratio
5.2 Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel
Target 5b: Achieve, by 2015, universal access to reproductive health
5.3 Contraceptive prevalence rate
5.4 Adolescent birth rate
5.5 Antenatal care coverage (at least one visit and at least four visits)
5.6 Unmet need for family planning Council and Commission statements - The Millennium Development Goal 5 (maternal health)

More competition in airline reservation systems - with protection for consumers
2008-08-28 - 09:51
MEPs will debate and vote on proposals to simplify and modernise the rules for the computerised reservation systems used by high-street and online travel agents to book airline tickets for their customers. MEPs believe this will mean more competition and therefore lower distribution costs, but they also want measures to ensure consumers get a fair deal - and can be presented with environment-friendlier travel options. Negotiations on a first-reading deal with Council are underway. The Code of Conduct for computerised reservation systems regulates how travel bookings are managed by air carriers, the CRS companies (e.g. Amadeus and Sabre), travel agents and, where relevant, rail operators. "This code was created 20 years ago in very different market conditions than the current ones. It is now increasingly ill-adapted to new market conditions, the deregulation of other CRSs markets around the world and the decrease of airline ownership in CRSs," says EP rapporteur Timothy KIRKHOPE (EPP-ED, UK).
The existing Code includes strict requirements on non-discrimination between airlines which date from the time when the various CRSs were owned by airlines themselves. In most cases, the CRSs are now independent from airlines and the strict rules now have the effect of stifling competition and raising costs, according to the Commission, leading airlines to favour alternative approaches, such as selling tickets via their own websites.
Competition on price and service quality
The main aim of the Commission proposal is that airlines and CRSs should be able to negotiate freely the conditions of the distribution of air services. Systems should compete on price and service quality. Under the revision, the committee believes, CRSs will have to compete more aggressively with each other for air carrier participation on the basis of lower booking fees and better service quality.
Definitions of parent carrier, control and participation in the capital
The only exception to this new freedom to negotiate terms of business concerns carriers who are the parent of a CRS – they must provide all the same information to other CRSs as they do to their own CRS. The text proposed by the committee revises the key definitions of 'parent carrier' and 'control' to limit the influence of airlines over CRSs, but also to make an exception for accidental investments not conferring ownership rights in the CRS.
Marketing Information Data Tapes and Data protection
MEPs in the committee propose allowing airlines to make agreements with travel agents to use the agents’ booking and sales data for their core operations such as sales and marketing. Personal data collected through CRSs’ activities must be protected via the relevant EU legislation and the international agreements signed by the EU on the issue.
A price is an inclusive price
The price shown in the principal display of the CRS should effectively be the price the customer pays, say MEPs in the committee, who propose an amendment insisting that it includes all applicable taxes, charges, surcharges and fees to be paid to the air carrier or rail-transport operator which are unavoidable and foreseeable at the time.
If it's a short flight, offer train options too
For air journeys of up to 90 minutes, the committee voted to include a requirement that where travel options are ranked, the best ranked alternative train services, including connecting services, must be featured on the first screen of the principal display. Where travel options serving the same departure and arrival cities are offered with connecting flights or the combination of scheduled air and rail services on the CRS, at least the best ranked option by scheduled air and rail service shall be featured on the first screen of the principle display.
CO2 emissions
The committee also proposes an amendment insisting that CRSs should, in future, contain easily understandable information about the CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of the flight. This would be shown via average fuel consumption data per person/litre/100km and average CO2 emissions per person/g/km, and could be compared with data of the best alternative train/bus connection for journeys of under five hours.

Guidelines urgently needed on state aid to ports, says Transport Committee
2008-08-28 - 09:51
The EP Transport Committee is urging the European Commission to adopt guidelines on state aid to ports by the end of this year. In an own-initiative report on European ports policy, MEPs in the committee urge the Commission to identify possible distortions of competition and to clarify in the state aid guidelines what types of aid to port authorities should be treated as state aid. They also look at ways to upgrade the port system to meet the EU's future transport needs. The own-initiative report by Josu Ortuondo LARREA (ALDE, ES), on the Commission communication on European Ports Policy, points out that the EU port sector is expanding fast and that the maritime sector is particularly affected by globalisation. It highlights the need to take account of major changes in international traffic resulting from technological and economic progress, the widening of the Panama Canal and the increase and size of capacity of vessels.
Links to port hinterland
Members in the committee also stress that maritime and river transport should not be isolated from land and air transport. Given that links to a port's hinterland are of great importance to its commercial success, one aim of the 2010 mid-term review of the trans-European network should be to integrate maritime and river transport with land transport via European ports, they say.
Customs controls
The committee also recommends that Community-cleared goods should be exempt from customs controls in short-sea shipping in the Community. It advocates creating separate port zones for intra-community and international traffic, simplifying internal transport, and standardising and identifying special containers. It calls on the Commission and the sector to encourage shipping companies to reduce the number of empty containers transported, so as to reduce environmental impact, whilst at the same time taking account of the specific needs of clients.
Social dialogue in the port sector
The committee urges that a social dialogue be established on port-related subjects, including worker's rights, concessions and the 1979 International Labour Organisation Convention on the occupational safety and health of dock workers. It also stresses the importance of protecting and ensuring the highest possible standard of training for port workers.
Scanning US-bound cargo
Finally, MEPs in the committee urge the Commission to pursue its efforts to win a reform of the US regulation requiring that 100% of US-bound cargo be scanned. It urges the Commission to evaluate the potential cost of this measure to business and to the EU economy, as well as its potential impact on customs operations.

Make freight a higher rail network priority, says Transport Committee
2008-08-28 - 09:51
The European Commission should allocate at least 40% of EU transport infrastructure appropriations to the railways and prioritise freight, to reduce the need for road transport, says an own-initiative report for by the Transport Committee. MEPs urge the Commission to concentrate EU co-financing on improving the efficiency, interoperability and upgrading of rail infrastructure, inter-modal hubs and other freight transport modes. The Commission should also define "green corridors", as exemplary inter-modal projects and encourage the shift to intelligent and environmentally-friendly transport modes so as to reduce accidents, congestion, noise, local toxic and non-toxic pollution, CO2 emissions, landscape and energy consumption, suggests the report by Michael CRAMER (Greens/EFA, DE).
Europe's freight transport system must meet integration and sustainability challenges
Members in the committee also stress that freight transport must meet pressing challenges to increase effective integration and sustainability, doing more to improve mobility and energy efficiency and to reduce oil consumption, polluting emissions and external costs. In an enlarged European Union, the use of more efficient logistics systems is part of the gradual integration of priority cross-border freight corridors, hubs and conventional networks, they say.
Streamline administration
To improve the transport system, the committee advocates standardising and simplifying the administration of freight transport market authorities and simplifying customs rules at borders. It welcomes the decision to establish a maritime space without barriers and urges the Commission to ask the appropriate international associations and organisations to develop a single inter-modal document, with the assistance of the relevant associations and organisations.
Solutions to the current blockages
MEPs in the committee also urge the Commission to propose, no later than the end of 2008, a programme for strengthening cooperation between the Member States responsible for transport projects. This should assess and facilitate solutions to the current blockages, with particular attention to goods transport, taking due account of the added value of logistics. The Commission is also asked to support projects seeking the differential use of existing high-speed lines, e.g. for freight transport.
Improve logistics education
Finally, MEPs in the committee call on the Member States to give absolute priority to higher and further education in logistics and freight transport. Rapporteur Michael CRAMER Greens/EFA DE A6-0326/2008 Freight transport in Europe Procedure : own-initiative

Hydrogen powered motor vehicles - supply network essential say MEPs
2008-08-28 - 09:51
Anja WEISGERBER (EPP-ED, DE) for the Internal Market Committee will be putting forward a legislative report on hydrogen powered motor vehicles. The committee points out that the successful introduction of hydrogen-powered vehicles on the European market will also depend on whether the appropriate hydrogen filling station network can be established in time. The Commission should, therefore, look into measures to support the establishment of a Europe-wide filling-station network for hydrogen powered vehicles.
The purpose of this proposal is to lay down harmonised technical provisions for the type-approval of hydrogen-powered vehicles for the first time. There is a need to introduce EU-wide approval criteria for such vehicles, to safeguard not only the operation of the single market but also a high level of safety and environmental protection. Since hydrogen-powered vehicles are not at present included in the EC type-approval system, Member States may grant approvals for such vehicles on a one-off basis without having to lay down new laws. In such a practice there is a risk that every Member State will draw up its own approval conditions, resulting in distortion of the single market. This would lead to high costs for manufacturers, create safety risks and also considerably impede the spread of hydrogen technology in the EU. For these reasons the rapporteur regards the Commission proposal as an important step towards obtaining alternative fuels for the transport sector.
In other parts of the world – such as in the United States or the Asian economic area – work is also proceeding on the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Here too the question of type-approval comes up. The EU’s negotiations at international level for approval conditions applicable worldwide are bound to take some while yet. An EU type-approval regulation could point the way forward for an international approval system.
Pure hydrogen in the future
In the future, hydrogen powered vehicles should be vehicles propelled by pure hydrogen produced as far as possible from renewable energies. Use of mixtures of hydrogen and natural gas/biomethane to propel vehicles must be no more than a transitional technology say MEPs.
Motorcycles
The regulation’s scope should also be expanded to include motor-cycles. And she also favours ensuring that rescue services are able to identify the hydrogen power source of such vehicles. For this purpose there are, in addition to the labelling scheme to be introduced initially, various longer-term options such as eCall (which automatically sends a signal to rescue services from the vehicle in the event of an accident), or a central database in which the vehicle’s technical data are stored independently of the vehicle’s owner and can be interrogated by accident rescue services.
Emergency services
The committee also says that it must be possible for rescue services to identify the hydrogen power source of a vehicle. Rapporteur Anja WEISGERBER EPP-ED DE A6-0201/2008 Motor vehicles: type-approval of hydrogen powered vehicles (amend. Directive 2007/46/EC) Procedure :

Environment
Mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010
2008-08-28 - 09:51
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is proposing an own-initiative report by Frédérique RIES (EPP-ED, BE) on the mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010. The committee acknowledges the efforts made by the Commission since the action plan was launched in 2004. It considers, however, that such an action plan is bound to fail at least in part, since it is designed solely to accompany existing Community policies, it is not based upon a preventive policy intended to reduce illnesses linked to environmental factors, and it pursues no clear, quantified objective.
MEPs in the committee regret the fact that the Commission has not provided sufficient funding for human biological monitoring in 2008 to enable it (as it had promised Parliament and the Member States) to introduce a consistent approach to biological monitoring within the EU. They call on the Commission to respond by 2010 to two essential objectives:
- Make members of the general public aware of environmental pollution and the impact thereof on their health;
- Adapt European risk-reduction policy.
MEPs in the committee recommend that the Member States meet their obligations as regards implementation of Community legislation and that the Commission does not weaken those laws under pressure from lobbies or regional or international organisations.
Vulnerable groups: MEPs in the committee stress that, when it comes to assessing the impact of environmental factors on health, consideration should be given first and foremost to vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, newborn babies, children and the elderly. Those who are the most susceptible to pollutants should be protected by specific measures to reduce exposure to indoor environmental contaminants in healthcare facilities and schools.
A new dynamic approach to protection based on the precautionary principle: MEPs claim that the EU needs to apply a continuous dynamic and flexible approach to the Action Plan and that it should acquire specific expertise on the subject of environmental health, to be based on transparency and on a multidisciplinary and adversarial approach which would thus enable the general public's distrust of official agencies and committees of experts to be countered. Although there have been genuine advances in environmental policy in recent years, MEPs in the committee state that EU policy still lacks a comprehensive preventive strategy and fails to apply the precautionary principle. The Commission should revise the criteria as regards recourse to the precautionary principle pursuant to European Court of Justice case-law, in order to ensure that an action and security principle based on the adoption of provisional and proportionate measures lies at the heart of Community health and environment policies.
Air quality : MEPs in the committee call once again upon the Commission to come forward as soon as possible with concrete measures on indoor air quality. The Commission is called upon to draft appropriate minimum requirements to guarantee the quality of indoor air in buildings to be newly built. MEPs recommend that, in awarding individual European Union support, the Commission bear in mind its impact on the quality of indoor air, exposure to electromagnetic radiation and the health of particularly vulnerable sections of the population. They also call for environmental quality standards for priority substances in water to be laid down. MEPs in the committee point out that certain Member States have successfully introduced mobile analysis laboratories (or ‘green ambulances’) to enable habitat pollution in public and private places to be diagnosed swiftly and reliably. They consider that the Commission could promote such a practice within the Member States which have not yet acquired such a means of direct intervention at a polluted site.
Dangers of new technologies : MEPs in the committee are concerned about the lack of specific legal provisions to ensure the safety of consumer products containing nanoparticles being put on the market. They are greatly concerned at the Bio-Initiative international report on electromagnetic fields, which highlights the health risks posed by emissions from mobile-telephony devices such as mobile telephones, UMTS, Wifi, Wimax and Bluetooth, and also DECT landline telephones. It notes that the limits on exposure to electromagnetic fields which have been set for the general public are obsolete. They do not take account of developments in information and communication technologies or vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, newborn babies and children.
Mental health : MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to pay attention to the serious problem of mental health, considering the number of suicides in the EU, and to devote more resources to the development of adequate prevention strategies and therapies.
To conclude, MEPs in the committee urge the Commission and Member States to acknowledge the advantages of the prevention and precautionary principles and to develop and implement tools enabling potential environmental and health threats to be anticipated and countered. They recommend that the Commission cost the 'second cycle' of this action plan and make provision for appropriate funding covering a larger number of practical measures to reduce environmental impact on health and to implement prevention and precautionary measures. Lastly, they urge the Council to take a decision without delay on the proposal for a regulation establishing the Union Solidarity Fund.

External/international trade
Developing countries growth to be boosted by opened trade in services
2008-08-28 - 09:51
Pursuing both the progressive and reciprocal opening of access to the service market in trade negotiations is underlined by MEPs in a report for the International Trade Committee. This would give access to entrepreneurs of developing countries to a wider range of service. The own-initiative report reiterates that liberalisation of services is important for both developed and developing countries. The efficiency gains that could be obtained thanks to opening markets to services competition could allow less developed countries to provide a greater range of services for their citizens. The importance of universal, accessible and sustainable services with affordable prices and high-quality standards is underlined in the report drafted by Syed KAMALL (EPP-ED, UK).
Services make up an ever increasing percentage of GDP of nearly every economy, 75% for EU, 78% for North America, 52% for Africa and 60% for Asia.
MEPs in the committee underline the need for rules and standards to govern liberalisation. MEPs also encourage compliance with environmental and quality standards, "without constituting unnecessary barriers to trade". Trade regulations must comply with ILO social standards.
ACP and ASEAN regional agreements
MEPs in the committee support the achievement of full Economic Partnership Agreements with the ACP countries that cover not only goods but also services and investment, thus enabling those countries' integration in the global economy. They also support the agreement on Mode 4 in the EU-CARIFORUM Economic Partnership Agreement. Mode 4 is the possibility for citizens from the Caribbean to work temporarily in the EU.
On the EU-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (FTA), MEPs say that the aspects of the agreement affecting public procurement, investments and services should "recognise the varying level of development of ASEAN members".
The European Commission is asked to pursue a balanced package with an ambitious offer in services, especially in financial services, where the European industry has competitive expertise and has a strong potential for growth, says the report.

Public health
UN level classification of hazardous substances to be incorporated into EU law
2008-08-28 - 09:51
Amalia SARTORI (EPP-ED, IT) for the Environment Committee will be putting forward three legislative reports on the classification, labelling and packing of substances and mixtures. The first-reading agreement concerns the implementation of the UN level agreed, GHS (Globally Harmonised System) on classification, labelling and packaging of hazardous substances into EU legislation. The new rules are similar to existing EU rules (which will be replaced later) but certain technical change will have to be made.
Objectives
The aim of the UN level agreed, GHS (Globally Harmonised System) system is to enable a judgment on a substance or mixture with respect to its hazardous properties (physical hazards and toxicity) and to provide a hazardous chemical with pertinent hazard labelling and information on safety measures (for example via labels, hazard pictograms and signal words ("danger" , "warning"). As with the current legislation, the proposed regulation is intended to be primarily a self-classification system for enterprises. The system aims at enhancing the protection of human health and the environment during the handling, transport and use of these chemicals. It is in line with REACH.
Chemicals are manufactured and traded globally, and their hazards are the same around the world. Therefore the description of hazards should not differ between countries if the product is the same. Enterprises will save costs if they do not have to assess hazard information for their chemicals against different sets of criteria. If the same criteria are used to identify the hazards of chemicals and the same labelling is used to describe them, the level of protection of human health and the environment becomes more consistent, transparent and comparable throughout the world.
Agreement with Council
The compromise which has been agreed between representatives of the Parliament and the Council, aims to implement the GHS system into EU legislation. The new regulation will replace the existing EU directives on classification and labelling of substances which set forth an extensive system (3 key directives), but the current rules and the GHS are conceptually similar. The proposal aims to maintain the current level of environment and health protection, to keep the scope of the classification and labelling rules as close as possible to the existing EU system and to ensure a smooth transition to a new system based on GHS. The reclassification and labelling of most substances must be completed by 1.12.2010 for substances and 1.6.2015 for mixtures. The current Directives on classification, labelling and packaging will be repealed on 1 June 2015. During a transitory period both systems will be applied.
• The regulation:
- harmonises the classification, labelling and packaging rules for substances and mixtures;
- obliges enterprises to classify their substances and mixtures themselves and to notify the classifications;
- establishes a harmonised list of substances classified at Community level in Annex VI;
- establishes a classification and labelling inventory, made up of all notifications and harmonised classifications referred to above.
In the negotiations, MEPs managed to include several changes to the Commission's proposals wanting to guarantee a proper balance between the interests of consumers, the environment and industry:
• Member States shall appoint a body or bodies responsible for receiving information for formulating preventative and curative measures, in particular in case of emergency health response. Three years after entry into force the Commission shall assess possibility to harmonise information
Animal testing
MEPs reiterate the commitment to reduce animal testing. Where new tests are carried out for the purposes of this Regulation, tests on animals within the meaning of Directive 86/609/EEC should only be undertaken only where no other alternatives, which provide an adequate reliability and quality of data, are possible.
Tests on non-human primates are prohibited for the purposes of this Regulation.
Tests on humans are not be performed for the purposes of this Regulation. Data obtained from other sources, such as clinical studies, can however be used for the purposes of this Regulation.

Economic and monetary affairs
Time to get serious on tax fraud
2008-08-28 - 09:51
€200-250 billion that should reach national budgets is thought to be lost to fiscal fraud. VAT fraud alone accounts for some €40 billion a year – ten per cent of the total receipts. The Economics Committee says it is time for Member States to get serious in tackling this problem and is calling for reform to the VAT system and the Savings Tax Directive. A report drawn up by Sharon BOWLES (ALDE, UK) to be debated by the full Parliament says some Member States have shown a “blockading attitude” in the last ten years when it comes to tackling tax fraud.
VAT system based on taxation in country of origin?
It says that in the long run a VAT system based on taxation in the country of origin of goods would be a solution to VAT fraud in cross-border supplies, but this would require approximation of tax rates between countries and a clearing system for sharing revenue. The best solution, says the committee, would be to impose a 15 per cent tax on intra-community supplies (they are presently exempt with tax charged when they are sold on in the destination country). A decentralised clearing house system for rebalancing payments between Member Sates (because of the differential rates of VAT) could be rapidly developed.
Caution over the reverse charge mechanism
Another much discussed proposal to tackle missing-trader fraud in the VAT system (where the company selling goods or services, which should pay VAT receipts to the tax system, is a sham organisation which vanishes) is to make the customer account for the tax instead of the supplier, except where the customer is a private individual. This “reverse-charge” mechanism would indeed solve this missing-trader problem, MEPs in the committee note, but they are concerned it might create new opportunities for fraud elsewhere as well as a heavy administrative burden for businesses and are cautious about introducing it on a wide scale.
The report also calls for more cooperation between Member States’ tax authorities in tacking fraud.
Remove loopholes in Savings Tax Directive; eliminate tax havens
Turning to taxation of savings and other financial income, MEPs in the committee want to see action against tax avoidance, a widening of the scope of the Savings Tax Directive and action through the OECD to tackle uncooperative tax havens. The EU should see the elimination of tax havens at worldwide level as a priority.
The committee regrets that Member States are hindering reform of the Savings Tax Directive and says it needs to be updated to remove loopholes and deficiencies. They ask the Commission to consider options including the widening of its scope to cover all legal entities and all sources of financial revenue.

Fisheries and Aquaculture in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management
2008-08-28 - 09:51
In proposing a report on "Fisheries and Aquaculture in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe", the Fisheries Committee stresses the importance of aquaculture to the food industry for social and economic development in some EU coastal communities. Furthermore, "aquaculture for repopulation purposes is an essential tool to achieve ecological conservation in certain coastal zones, and it must therefore be promoted, stimulated and financially supported", MEPs say. The report drawn up by Ioannis GLAVAKIS (EPP-ED, EL) emphasises that the European Fisheries Fund can contribute to the long-term funding of measures within the framework of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe (ICZM) since it supports actions which contribute to the sustainable development of fishing regions.
The Fisheries Committee proposes that aquaculture projects which use renewable energy sources and which do not infringe areas protected under EU environmental law should be given priority under ICZM. According to MEPs in the Fisheries Committee, greater research efforts should be made in aquaculture with a view to introducing closed-circuit intensive-production cultivation systems.
The Fisheries Committee calls on the Commission, after consulting Member States, to set a clear timetable for examining progress in the implementation of ICZM in the EU.
The importance of proper spatial planning
The implementation of integrated-management policies involves the planning in coastal areas of population-related, tourism-related and economic uses and of landscape and environmental protection.
According to Ioannis GLAVAKIS, "the viability of fishing and aquaculture is being affected by the very rapid transformation of natural coastal areas into artificial surfaces". Between 1990 and 2000 it is estimated that artificial surfaces spread by 190 km2 annually. 61% of this expansion is due to housing, tourism and recreation displacing other activities.
"Regional planning has so far been land-based and has failed to take into account the impact of coastal development on certain marine activities. This has led to limits on fishing grounds and the degradation of marine habitats, i.e. the feeding, spawning and reproduction areas of some species. At the same time, lack of space is also a basic obstacle to the development of European aquaculture", stresses the report, emphasising the importance of proper spatial planning.
This report is the committee reaction to the Commission communication of 7 June 2007 entitled "An evaluation of Integrated Coastal Zone management in Europe".

Fisheries
Management of non-tuna species in the Southern Indian Ocean
2008-08-28 - 09:51
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report drawn up by its chairman, Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR), on the conclusion of the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement. This new Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) will exercise its responsibilities for the effective conservation and management of non-tuna species in the high seas of the Southern Indian Ocean. The Community has fishing interests in the South Indian Ocean and is also a Coastal State on behalf of Réunion. In 2000, the South Indian Ocean fishing states (the Comoros, France, Kenya, Mozambique, New Zealand and Seychelles) and the European Community together with FAO took the initiative to launch the process of setting up a new regional fisheries organisation (Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement).
The Community signed the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) on 7 July 2006, in conformity with the Council Decision No. 2006/496/EC adopted by the Council on 6 July 2006. On 21 December 2007, the European Commission forwarded to the Council a proposal for a decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the SIOFA. The Council decided on 30 January 2008 to consult the European Parliament on this agreement and sent a request for consultation.
The only amendment put forward by the Fisheries Committee concerns the legal basis of this dossier, since the committee considers that it is not a case of consultation, but rather of assent.

Ombudsman
Commission should speed up infringement proceeding say MEPs
2008-08-28 - 09:51
Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, IE) will be putting forward an own-initiative report backing a European Ombudsman special report which said that the Commission had failed to deal with the complainant's infringement complaint within a reasonable period of time and that this constituted an instance of maladministration. In November 2001, the complainant, a German doctor, requested the Commission to open infringement proceedings against Germany. The complainant argued that Germany infringed Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organization of working time, in so far as the activity of doctors in hospitals was concerned, in particular as regards time spent on call by these doctors. In the complainant's view, this resulted in a considerable risk for both staff and patients.
In this complaint the complainant alleged that the Commission had failed to deal with his infringement complaint within an appropriate period of time.
Time taken to conclude infringement proceedings
The report states its concern at the unjustified and excessive amount of time – often spanning several years – which the Commission takes to pursue and conclude infringement proceedings and its dissatisfaction with the frequent examples of non-compliance by Member States with decisions of the Court of Justice; considers that this undermines the credibility of the formulation and coherent application of Community law and that it serves to discredit the objectives of the EU;
The committee emphasises once again the key role of the Member States in correctly implementing Community legislation and underlines the fact that the practical application thereof is decisive for the purposes of increasing the relevance of the European Union for its citizens.
