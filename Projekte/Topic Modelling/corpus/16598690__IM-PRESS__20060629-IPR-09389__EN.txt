In adopting a resolution on the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of MEPs, the House recalls the Council's undertaking to convene an Intergovernmental Conference in order to modify the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities in respect of the provisions relating to Members of the European Parliament.
The House also confirms that the basis for the IGC must be the Statute approved by the European Parliament on 3 and 4 June 2003. Finally, MEPs call on the Council to ensure the appropriate European Parliament involvement in that IGC.
