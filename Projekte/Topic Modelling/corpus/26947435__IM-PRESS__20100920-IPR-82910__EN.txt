The Heads of EU Delegations to China, Georgia, Japan, Lebanon and Pakistan will be invited to appear before the Foreign Affairs Committee in October, according to a decision of leading MEPs of the Committee who met today in Strasbourg. The Committee will also hear the new EU Special Representative to Sudan, Rosalind Marsden, appointed 11 August 2010.
MEPs also decided that these meetings would be held in public.
Before taking up their posts, EU Special Representatives and Heads of Delegations to countries and organisations which Parliament considers "strategically important" have to appear before the Foreign Affairs Committee, according to the deal reached on the External Action Service with the Council, the Commission and the High Representative and endorsed by Parliament last July.
