Nobel winner Joseph Stiglitz addresses the meeting
Two months ago Slovenia became the 13th country to officially adopt the euro. Just last week Malta joined Cyprus in officially applying to join the currency from next year. With new members apparently queuing up to join, MEPs and national MPs last week held a two-day debate on the currency. It focused on economic growth, tackling unemployment and the need for EU members to coordinate their economic policies more closely.
Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the European Central Bank and the man charged with coordinating economic policy in Europe offered a tough defence of the single currency: He describe the euro as a "credible currency" saying that "few of us thought it possible but it is a great success". However, he balanced his remarks by saying that the EU needs to complete its single market, notably in services as well as improving the flexibility of its workforce.
Pöttering urges all countries to adopt euro
Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering called the euro project a "success". He noted that many people said it was an "impossible project" and given this achievement urged all EU members to adopt it. Currently only Denmark and the UK have opted out while all the states that joined in 2004 and 2007 are obliged under the Accession Treaty to move their economies to a position where they can adopt the euro. Mr Pöttering also called for the ECB's independent monetary policy be maintained.
In November last year a special "Euro barometer" survey compiled by the EU's statistical agency asked people their perceptions of the euro five years after its adoption. A majority - 59% said they have "no problems" in using the notes and coins while 48% thought adoption of the currency "advantageous". Enthusiasm for the currency was most marked in Ireland and Finland.
Nobel economist calls euro a "credible currency"
It was the political aspect of the cooperation of the euro which concerned Pervenche Berès , the Chair of Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. She said national parliaments and the EP must cooperate more closely in economic matters on the global stage. She also said that economic differences still exist across EU members.
Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz told the hearing that "economic globalisation had gone much faster than political globalisation". He congratulated the euro saying that it has established itself as a "credible currency". However he warned that "growth within the euro-zone has not been as great as it could have been, as there has been too strong a focus on lowering inflation".
