EU Member States should be allowed to export radioactive waste to non-EU countries provided the waste is processed in accordance with new EU safety rules, said Parliament's Energy Committee on Thursday, as it voted on a draft directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. MEPs also backed stricter rules for the protection and training of workers in the industry.
Under the proposed directive, each Member State will have to devise policies and programmes to ensure that spent fuel and waste is safely processed and disposed of. National policies must include inventories as well as plans for the management of all facilities, even after they close down.
Is exporting waste to non-EU countries acceptable?
One of the most contentious issues for MEPs was whether to allow the export of radioactive waste outside the EU. The Energy Committee eventually backed the option of allowing exports to third countries provided the exporting Member State ensures that the radioactive waste is "disposed of in compliance with the provisions of this Directive".
Safety and health of workers, adequate funding for waste management
Workers involved in the management of radioactive waste, from generation to disposal, must receive proper protection and training, insists the Energy Committee.
In addition, Member States must ensure that "sufficient financial resources are available when needed to cover all necessary expenses related to decommissioning and management of spent fuel and radioactive waste", say MEPs, adding that this should always be done according to the "polluter pays principle" and avoiding "any recourse to State aid".
Next steps
The Energy Committee's report, drafted by Romana Jordan Cizelj (EPP, SL), was adopted today by 31 votes to 7 with 10 abstentions. Parliament's plenary vote will take place in the second June plenary session, which will be held in Brussels.
The initial proposal by the Commission was presented in November 2010. The directive is based on the Euratom Treaty and falls under the consultation procedure. Council will take a final decision only after it has received Parliament's position.
