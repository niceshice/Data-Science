Hedge funds and private equity: new rules soon in place
2010-11-10 - 09:56
On Thursday MEPs will be asked to give their final approval to new EU laws on hedge funds and private equity funds, hammered out in over a year of intensive negotiations. These laws will impose registration, reporting and initial capital requirements on a sector of the financial industry hitherto subject only to "light touch" regulation. In return, it will be possible to market these funds throughout the European Union under a single set of EU rules rather than 27 different national systems, thus giving a boost to the European single market.
In the negotiations, Parliament's representatives won concessions from Member States to improve economic stability and investor security, Parliament's key priorities throughout the process. The legislation introduces rules on pay and restrictions on asset stripping. Neither of these issues was addressed by the Commission's initial proposal and both sets of rules were at first strongly resisted by Member States. The legislation also lays down strict rules on the liability of depositaries, who are key players in running these funds, to ensure that investors never lose their right to claim damages.
The directive's rules are to be implemented by 2013 and reviewed by the Commission four years later. At Parliament's request, this review will include an assessment of the need to strengthen the rules on asset stripping.

Parliament to set its priorities ahead of EU-US summit
2010-11-10 - 09:56
In a vote on Thursday MEPs will lay down their recommendations to the Council for the EU-US summit of 20 November. Economic co-operation, personal data protection, the introduction of travel fees and the recent leaks of classified US military documents on Iraq are likely to be the main areas covered in a resolution tabled by all the EP political groups.
Trade relations with the US in the context of the economic crisis and ahead of the upcoming Transatlantic Economic Council meeting will be a key issue in Wednesday's debate. Parliament has long supported the aim of achieving a barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015 but concerns remain regarding differing rules on novel foods, genetically modified products and animal cloning. Another sensitive topic is intellectual property rights, including negotiations on an Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).
Parliament is also expected to set out its priorities on EU-US international relations, including the fight against terrorism, the latest talks in the Middle East, the use of nuclear weapons and the US nuclear presence in Europe, and a common EU-US strategy on Afghanistan, Pakistan and UN sanctions against Iran. The controversial disclosure by Wikileaks of US military information on alleged torture in Iraq may also be raised.
Personal data protection
Personal data protection, notably bank data transfers (Terrorism Tracking Finance Programme), has been a difficult area in EU-US relations recently. A general EU-US data protection agreement is now under discussion, as is a new agreement on the sharing of passenger flight data (PNR). Parliament will have a right of veto on both accords. Both sides stress that security and civil liberties need not be mutually exclusive.
Parliament will vote on Thursday on a resolution relating to PNR, separately from the resolution on the EU-US summit.

Unspent EU money to be used for energy saving projects
2010-11-10 - 09:56
Around €146 million of unused EU funds could be released to finance energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energy projects once MEPs have voted on Thursday on an agreement with the Council. Amended legislation on the European Energy Recovery Plan (EERP) will channel the unspent money into a new fund, to finance projects such as:
renovation of public and private buildings to improve energy efficiency or switching to renewable energy;
the construction of renewables-based heat-and-power installations, with distribution networks, and their integration into electricity grids;
clean urban public transport solutions, particularly electric and hydrogen vehicles;
local infrastructure, including efficient street lighting, electricity storage, smart metering and smart grids.
The fund will focus chiefly on helping local and regional authorities to pay for such projects, which must be economically and financially viable, so as to refund the investment in due course. A total of €146.34 million will be available from 1 January 2011 and must be allocated by 31 March 2014.
Contributions from the fund could take the form of loans, guarantees, equity or other financial products. Up to 15% of the funding may be used to provide technical assistance to public authorities to help set up the projects. Geographical balance is to be an important criterion in the selection of projects.
Background
The EERP, which was launched in 2009, aims to boost economic recovery by funding energy projects such as cross-border gas and electricity inter-connectors, offshore wind parks, and Carbon Capture and Storage projects (CCS). In 2010 a total of €3.98 billion was earmarked for such plans.
Parliament sought unsuccessfully to include energy efficiency and renewable energy in the EERP when it was first proposed. The European Commission promised to consider this at a later stage, using funds unspent by the end of 2010. The amended regulation provides a legal base to do this, otherwise the money would go back to national budgets.

Visa waiver for Taiwan awaits MEPs' vote
2010-11-10 - 09:56
Taiwanese nationals will no longer need visas to enter the EU under plans to be put to the vote in Strasbourg on Thursday. For its part, Taiwan does not require visas for most EU citizens to enter its territory. The exceptions are Cypriot, Romanian and Bulgarian nationals but the Taiwanese authorities have promised to exempt these countries too by the end of 2010.

Ashton to discuss EU role in strengthening OSCE
2010-11-10 - 09:56
MEPs and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton will discuss the role the EU could play in enhancing the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE needs to hold regular high level summits and play a more active role in conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation, says a draft resolution tabled by all the EP political groups for a vote on Thursday.
It may also be the appropriate forum to discuss a legally binding European Security Treaty with Russia, thus improving stability in non-EU countries in Europe. The EU's new External Action Service will also need to work out how to cooperate with the OSCE in international election observation missions (currently the OSCE'S main political task).
This week's European Parliament debate is taking place ahead of the next OSCE summit on 1 December in Astana, Kazakhstan.

EU livestock sector in crisis
2010-11-10 - 09:56
MEPs will ask the European Commission about its plans to help the EU livestock sector cope with the burden of high feed prices, including cereals. At a time when the livestock sector has to comply with stringent environmental, food security and animal welfare rules, and with feed accounting for up to 60% of total production costs, MEPs will ask the Commission what steps can be taken to tackle price volatility, other than the already announced release of grain stocks to deflate short-term prices.

EU research programmes: keep it simple
2010-11-10 - 09:56
Parliament should back measures to simplify the implementation of EU Research Framework Programmes, says a draft resolution by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. European research and innovation programmes have grown in scope in recent years, both in terms of their applications and the size of their budgets. More money brings more control procedures, with rules that pose particularly challenges for SMEs, high-tech start-ups and smaller institutes.
Researchers would like to see harmonised procedures, greater simplification and more trust on the part of the EU. MEPs believe the system of research funding should place greater trust in applicants and be more risk-tolerant.

Greater solidarity between generations
2010-11-10 - 09:56
Ideas to boost the employment rate of younger and older people in the EU so as to relieve the financial burden on social security systems and pension funding are the focus of a draft resolution by the Employment Committee. Increasing longevity combined with low birth rates may place a heavy burden on rising generations, says the resolution drafted by Thomas Mann (EPP, DE). The resolution suggests a "fifty plus employment pact" to increase the proportion of working people over fifty to 55% by 2020 as well as a "European Youth Guarantee" to ensure that after a maximum of four months' unemployment young people are offered a job, an apprenticeship, training or combined work and training.

Relaunching the European single market
2010-11-10 - 09:56
A proposed "Single Market Act" to relaunch the EU single market will be debated by MEPs on Wednesday. Although a core EU policy area, the single market does not yet enable people to move, shop and sell across EU internal borders as easily as they can at home. Unfulfilled expectations include a true single market for services and an online single market.
The Services Directive, if implemented in full, could boost trade in commercial services by 45% and foreign direct investment by 25%, thereby increasing GDP by between 0.5% and 1.5%.
Cross-border online trade is hobbled by fragmented markets and consumer protection requirements. Today only 7% of EU consumers would consider buying online from another Member State. Yet unlocking the single market's full economic potential could generate over €100 billion in revenue, says Commissioner Michel Barnier.
In a resolution in May 2010, Parliament urged the Commission to tackle the top 20 single market-related sources of consumer dissatisfaction and called for a Single Market Act. Commissioner Barnier presented his Single Market Act initiative - combining legislative and non-legislative measures - on 27 October. At the same time he launched a four-month EU-wide debate on the single market's future.

Parliament will vote on EU funding of €7.4 million for 850 Irish workers who have lost their jobs in the aircraft maintenance industry in and around Dublin. The aid for the former workers of SR Technics will help the hardest hit workers back into employment by offering them guidance and training as well as promoting entrepreneurship and self-employment.

The budget discharge procedure for the financial year 2009 begins on Tuesday, when Court of Auditors President Vítor Caldeira presents the annual report on the reliability of the EU's accounts to the Budgetary Control Committee. The full Parliament will then hold a debate on the report on Thursday. The discharge procedure enables Parliament to hold the other EU institutions to account for their use of EU taxpayers' money. Once the accounts have been audited and finalised, Parliament will decide whether to sign off the 2009 budgets of the Commission and other EU bodies.
