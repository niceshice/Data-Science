New European Institute for Gender Equality

The European Parliament adopted a first reading report on plans to set up an independent European Institute for Gender Equality. While strongly supporting the creation of this new Community body, MEPs wish to make it more effective by sharpening the focus of its work. They also want guarantees about the management board's gender balance. It is hoped the Institute will be able to start work next year.
The report, drafted by Lissy Gröner (PES, DE) and Amalia Sartori (EPP-ED, IT), was adopted by 362 votes in favour, to 263 against, with 18 abstentions.
The European Parliament wants the Institute to be operational " as soon as possible " and certainly no later than twelve months after the regulation establishing it enters into force. EU governments have not yet decided where the Institute is to be located.
The Parliament wants to make the institute more proactive by shifting the focus of its work away from the mere collection and recording of data on gender equality and towards the analysis of such data, so as to enable the EU to " effectively promote and implement gender equality policy ". MEPs believe that what is lacking at EU and national level is a capacity to pool analysis and come up with innovative solutions on, for example, gender mainstreaming.
Regarding the Institute's Management Board, the nine members should, according to MEPs, be appointed by the Council, in consultation with the European Parliament, from a list drawn up by the Commission and should as well have three representatives from NGOs, employers' and worker organisations. MEPs say the aim must be to achieve an equal representation between women and men and that there should at least be a " guarantee that the representation of both sexes is not below 40% ."
If approved, the Institute will be funded with a proposed budget of € 52.5 million for the period 2007 to 2013. The setting up of the Gender Equality Institute beginning of 2007 is one of the key actions put forward in the Commission's Road Map for equality between women and men 2006-2010, presented 1 March 2006.
