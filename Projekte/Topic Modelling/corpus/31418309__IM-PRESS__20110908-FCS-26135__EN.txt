Lessons learned from 2010 oil spill: stricter rules for offshore drilling
MEPs looking for better planning before drilling begins ©BELGA/AFP Offshore oil and gas drilling within the EU must be subject to the highest safety and environmental standards, according to a report from the industry committee debated on Monday evening.
Following the biggest accidental marine oil spill in history in 2010, the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, and ahead of proposals on offshore oil and gas from the European Commission later this month, the committee looked at safety standards for offshore drilling in the EU. Over 90% of oil and 60% of gas is produced offshore.
"This report sets out suggestions to prevent accidents happening," according to the report's author, British Conservative Vicky Ford.
The report calls for drilling to be contingent on approval by national authorities of an environmental impact assessment and contingency plan submitted by the operators at least two months before operations begin. The plan should identify potential hazards, assess pollution sources and effects and outline a response strategy in case of an accident, including drilling plans for a relief well and the identification of appropriate response equipment.
MEPs also considered the opinion of the Environment Committee, which wants companies to have to prove they have the finances to cover the costs of environmental damage in case of an accident or a spill, perhaps through mandatory insurance .

Strasbourg session: economic crisis, progress in Libya, 10th anniversary of 9/11
"war on terrorism is still on" - President Buzek EU efforts to defuse the economic crisis and progress towards ending the war in Libya were highlighted by Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek at the opening of this week's plenary session in Strasbourg. Mr Buzek also marked the tenth anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, and condemned the 2 July extremist attack on the house of UK MEP Sajjad Karim.
On the economic crisis, Mr Buzek noted that further to constant exchanges among Europe's economic and political leaders over the summer, Commission President José Manuel Barroso would soon table fresh proposals, and that Euro-group President Jean-Claude Juncker would address the house later in September.
On Libya, he welcomed the prospect of an end to fighting and stressed Parliament's wish to help the people of Libya to rebuild their country
Sajjad Karim
Mr Buzek strongly condemned the 2 July attacks by a 30-strong extremist group carrying anti-Islamic placards on the house of MEP Sajjad Karim (ECR, UK). "Such threats to the freedom of speech of individual Members of Parliament are unacceptable. Mr Karim has been given a mandate in a democratic election by British citizens. Any attack on him and on his family is an attack on democracy and against his electorate", he said.
10th anniversary of 9/11
"The war against terrorism is still on", 10 years after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon had taken the lives of almost 3,000 innocent people from 70 nations, noted Mr Buzek.
"Success will come when we change the thinking of those who have no respect for life" he added, stressing the duty of Europe's politicians to deliver to future generations a Europe of security and peace.
Resignations and new arrivals
Mr Buzek announced the resignations of Eva-Britt Svensson (as of 1 September) and Dirk Sterckx (as of 7 September). Mr Sterckx is to be replaced by Philippe De Backer (ALDE, BE).
Luigi de Magistris, whose seat had been declared vacant, is to be replaced by Andrea Zanoni (ALDE, IT).
Mr Buzek also welcomed new members Franck Proust (EPP, FR), Dimitrios Droutsas (S&D, EL), and Tarja Cronberg (Greens/EFA, FI).
Agenda changes
It was agreed that a resolution on Libya would be put to the vote on Thursday 15 September, not at the September II session as originally planned. The change was moved by the EPP group, and approved with 131 votes in favour and 95 against.
Parliament agrees to strengthen Frontex border control agency
Special fundamental rights officer ©FRONTEX MEPs agreed to beef up the budget for Frontex Tuesday, which should improve the EU's border control agency's effectiveness. The plan, which is also backed by ministers, will allow the agency to purchase cars, helicopters and other border monitoring equipment instead of relying on the member states. Following demands by the EP, the agency will appoint an inspector to ensure respect for human rights.
The proposals were approved by a large majority (431 in favour, 49 against, 48 abstentions).
Although Frontex will have its own budget it will continue to be a coordinating agency with day-to-day border control operations remaining the responsibility of EU countries.
The new budget and equipment will be reserved for special missions in cases of emergency, according to Maltese EPP member Simon Busuttil , who steered the legislation through the EP. "We do not expect to have an army of sorts...but we wanted to have basic equipment that will enable it to engage in missions especially in cases of emergency."
EU countries must shoulder their responsibilities
In order to make the changes reality, member states must make good on their promises of staff and equipment. This failure has held the agency back, Mr Busuttil said during the debate on Frontex. "When it came to member states, they did not deliver."
"This agency was asked to start running before it could walk. Despite every good intention it has not lived up to expectations so far," he said
MEPs concerned about fundamental rights
In response to Parliament's concerns about the fundamental rights of immigrants, Frontex will appoint a special fundamental rights officer and a consultative forum set up. If fundamental rights are breached, or the law broken a mission will be suspended or terminated. Frontex will also have to report back to the EP on its fundamental rights work regularly.
Among other changes, the Frontex border patrols Joint Support Teams and Rapid Border Intervention Teams will now be combined and known simply as European Border Guards. The national guards who make up these teams will be subject to an exchange program.

Galileo: helping you get safely to where you're going
Glante expects Galileo to boost jobs The first two of the 30 satellites that will make up the Galileo navigation system, the European Union's answer to America's ubiquitous GPS, are set to be launched into space in late October. Galileo should make air travel safer, cut time spent in traffic jams and enhance border security - but only if the satellite signals are picked up by your receiver. Parliament Tuesday approved rules on public regulated services (PRS), one of the five services Galileo will offer once it is fully functional.
The rules concern the legal framework member states should establish for PRS users and the receivers.
What is PRS?
Once it is available in 2014, police, fire-fighters, the coast guard and border patrols will be among the users of PRS. But what is the difference between PRS and the open service that is available freely in things like car navigation?
The PRS signal is "encrypted and largely secured against distortions and jamming. Fire-fighters will thus be able to receive life-saving information even when our car navigation systems go blank because of open service malfunction or terrorists distorting the signal," said German Socialist Norbert Glante , who guided the legislation through the EP .
A receiver will be needed to get navigation signals from space, so in order to support the take-up of Galileo services around the world Mr Glante wants non-EU countries to be allowed to participate in PRS services. "That is why it has to be possible to produce PRS-receivers and their parts outside the EU...the condition for that is the signing of security agreements that rule out all risks," he said, noting that at this time he can't see the receivers being produced in China.
Galileo, future benefits
Mr Glante noted that the Commission promised the first operational Galileo services for 2014. "In the past, there were many delays, that is why I hope that everybody will help make Galileo operational as soon as possible," said Mr Glante, who does not expect the recession to have any impact on the project if there are no cost overruns.
He expects Galileo to boost employment as the new technology gathers steam and says it will also allow Europe to enter new markets and set standards in satellite navigation.

MEPs call for unified EU response to debt crisis
Some MEPs fear Greek default With the economic crisis in the European Union showing no signs of abating, MEPs Wednesday emphasised the need for a unified European response to stabilise the situation. The adoption of a legislative package on economic governance would be a big step in the right direction, MEPs agreed while warning that ordinary people cannot be expected to bear the whole cost of the crisis.
Polish Finance Minister Jan Vincent Rostowski painted a bleak picture of the EU situation. "There is no doubt that we are in danger, that Europe is in danger," he said, praising ECB intervention to stabilise markets and warning that governments must find ways to avoid the break-up of the eurozone. "If the eurozone breaks up, the EU won't survive for much longer." He called on the Parliament to adopt as soon as possible the legislative package on economic governance that is currently being negotiated with the Council.
Mr Rostowski cited a recent study by Swiss Bank UBS that showed an exit from the eurozone would cost weaker countries 40-50 % of GDP in the first year and 10-20% in following years, while richer countries would take a hit a 10-25% the first year and would face lower economic growth and higher unemployment later.
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso said the most important steps to solving the euro crisis are the fulfilment of the Greek reform program and adoption of the economic governance package. Markets are impatient so "we need to act fast." He said the Commission will soon present proposals on eurobonds and a financial transaction tax. The EU will have to act as one, he said, agreements between governments will not suffice.
For the EPP group, Joseph Daul said European citizens are concerned as they are continuously asked to make sacrifices while governments have not managed to put an end to the crisis. If the EU adopts the economic governance package, this will show that the EU can work for the long-term, he said, underlining the need for "the big bang", a clear commitment by EU governments to European integration, at whose heart is the eurozone.
Socialist leader Martin Schulz warned that the crisis is straining European unity. "We thought that the measures agreed on to save the euro on 21 July were appropriate. But the leaders who decided on them are trying to save their skins as politicians in their member states. We are at crossroads. Only if we act together will we have a chance to save the euro," he said. " Budget discipline has to be just. Ordinary people alone cannot pay the bill."
"Lets not make the mistake of calling this a Greek crisis," Liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt said. "Greece may have been the trigger but this is a deep crisis for the eurozone itself" because of the absence of economic and fiscal union alongside monetary union and the lack of true economic governance, he said. "We need proposals on true governance, eurobonds, a growth and jobs pact and a far stronger governance role for the Commission as opposed to the member states."
"We are pushing Greece into a hole from which she will not emerge without devaluation, a Greek default is a matter of time," Derk Jan Eppink said for the ECR group. On the call for eurobonds, he noted that Germany would have to foot the bill, an idea which is opposed by the liberal FDP in Germany but favoured by their political group leader in the EP.
EFD leader Nigel Farage also expects Greece to default and warned that there will be a revolution, if Greece isn't allowed to exit the eurozone. "Help Greece get her currency back and reschedule her debt," he said to Mr Barroso.
Greens co-leader Rebecca Harms said the common man is paying the cost of the crisis, not the rich. However, she says the EU remains one of the more successful areas in the world and should opt for more integration , as the markets will use any weakness to speculate against the euro.
Lothar Bisky for the GUE/NGL group said the crisis is hitting the population, weakening investment and social cohesion and leaving citizens in doubt about the competence of governments and EU institutions on economic policy. The EU must maintain funding for cohesion, education, culture and other "EU added value" sectors, he added.

MEPs call for cuts in non-CO2 greenhouse emissions
EP calls for comprehensive climate package ©BELGA/SCIENCE Great efforts have been made to reduce CO2 emissions in Europe and internationally, but a number of other substances are also causing Arctic ice-melt and on Wednesday MEPs called for action against so-called non-CO2 emissions including the hydroflourocarbons (HFCs) used in refrigerators and black carbon.
The Parliament wants a comprehensive European climate policy covering all sources of global warming. "European policy on the mitigation of climate change should be complemented by reductions of non-CO2 gases," said Austrian Christian Demcorat Richard Seeber, one of the co-authors of the report. "This can be done in a cost-effective and timely manner with existing tools."
Co-author Greek Liberal Theodoros Skylakakis said reducing non-CO2 emissions would reduce the overall cost of fighting climate change. According to the two MEPs the public price of reducing some HFCs is 5-10 cents a tonne, compared with €13 a tonne for carbon.
The resolution approved by the EP urges the Commission to phase out production and consumption of HFCs and calls for immediate action on reducing black carbon emissions. Prioritising emissions that affect the Arctic, Greenland and the Himalayan-Tibetan glaciers is a fast-action method of halting glacial melting, it says.
Ahead of the vote, the co-authors put a question to the Commission on the issue Tuesday Some non-CO2 emissions HFCs increasingly used as an alternative to ozone-damaging CFCs in refrigeration. Although effective they can also be powerful greenhouse gases with long atmospheric lifetimes Nitrogen oxides (NOx) come mainly from burning fossil fuels Black carbon is formed through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, bio fuel, and biomass. Experts think it particularly affects Arctic ice, Himalayan glaciers EP resolution Oral queston
Energy market: wholesale traders will be obliged to disclose deals
New rules to prevent abuses ©BELGA/Jan Woitas New rules to prevent abuses in wholesale energy trading, and thus protect end consumers, were adopted by Parliament on Wednesday. Wholesale trading will now be monitored independently across the EU, to enable Member States to prevent and punish anti-competitive behaviour.
The EU Regulation on energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT) - approved with 616 votes in favour, 26 against and 24 abstentions - will govern all wholesale energy trading in the EU, covering contracts and derivatives for the supply and transportation of natural gas and electricity. New rules will ban the use of insider information and market manipulation practices, while national penalties for breaches will have to reflect the damage done to consumers.
"We want pricing for consumers to be transparent and unfortunately there are too many deals in the wings paid for at the end by the consumers with too high energy prices something which greatly affects employment and growth. Europe needs more transparent energy markets protected against abuse and this regulation is aimed at that" said rapporteur Jorgo Chatzimarkakis (ALDE, DE) during the debate.
"Energy must remain affordable for everyone as it is the key to the economy. I welcome this important regulation which guarantees transparency and prevents abuses in wholesale energy trading ensuring affordability and fairness in the market. The regulation will help to ensure more transparent pricing across the EU", said Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek.
ACER's monitoring role
All trade deals will be monitored by the newly established Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) which will supply the data to EU Member States, to aid them in investigating breaches of the regulation and enforce remedies. To balance ACER's powers with those of national regulators and ensure its independence, its Director will be required to consult them on REMIT issues, but will not be bound by their opinions.
EU register
At Parliament's request, an EU register will be drawn up, based on national registers and listing all energy traders. No market participant will be able to enter into a transaction unless it has been registered.
Next steps
Once the regulation is agreed formally at first-reading it will enter into force 20 days after its publication in the EU Official Journal. The provisions on the reporting of information by traders to ACER (the list of contracts and derivatives which must be reported and uniform rules to be applied), will take effect six months after the Commission approves the necessary implementing acts.

Syria's Assad must go, and Libya's resources must benefit all Libyans, say MEPs
MEPs call on Assad to go ©BELGA/AFP/HO/YOUTUBE MEPs called for a halt to the use of force against peaceful protesters in Syria, and said President Bashar al Assad should step down immediately, in a resolution passed on Thursday. In a separate resolution, also passed on Thursday, Parliament called on Libya's National Transitional Council to manage its national resources for the benefit of all Libyans.
The escalating use of force against peaceful protesters in Syria, including mass arrests, extrajudicial killings, torture and the brutal and systematic persecution of pro-democracy activists, human rights defenders and journalists were strongly condemned by MEPs.
Crackdowns must stop, Assad must step down
MEPs demanded an immediate halt to violent crackdowns against peaceful demonstrators, expressing their condolences to the victims' families and their solidarity with Syrian people fighting for their rights, whose courage and determination Parliament "commended".
Parliament called on President Bashar al Assad and his regime to relinquish power immediately, and demanded an independent, transparent and effective investigation into killings, arrests, and torture by the Syrian security forces, so as to bring the perpetrators to account.
Targeted sanctions
Parliament welcomed new EU measures against the Syrian regime, including a ban on crude oil imports from Syria to the EU. However, MEPs insisted that further sanctions should target the regime and avoid worsening the living conditions of the people.
MEPs urged UN Security Council members, and in particular Russia and China, to condemn the use of lethal force in Syria and to impose sanctions should the regime fail to put an end to violence.
Finally, MEPs welcomed the humanitarian assistance provided to Syrian refugees by neighbouring countries, in particular Turkey.
On developments in Syria, President Jerzy Buzek said: "We cannot allow the Syrian regime to continue killing the Syrian people. Authorities in Damascus have lost all remaining legitimacy and must step aside immediately. I hope the Syrian opposition will unite and offer a credible alternative for a political transition. We Europeans must assume our responsibility to protect civilians and our responsibility to protect democracy."
Unified, democratic Libya
In a separate resolution, also passed on Thursday, MEPs congratulated the Libyan people on their courage and determination, and welcomed the fall of the 42-year autocratic regime of Muammar Gaddafi.
Parliament expressed full support for the National Transitional Council (NTC), and urged the EU to assist the new Libyan authorities in building a unified, democratic and pluralist Libya that guarantees human rights and fundamental freedoms.
MEPs called on EU Member States to seek UN Security Council authorisation to release frozen Libyan assets to help the NTC to deliver the governance Libya needs.
Parliament also called for an effective and credible common EU strategy for Libya, and asked Member States to refrain from taking unilateral actions or initiatives that might weaken it.
Gaddafi must be brought to justice
MEPs urged all countries, and especially Libya's neighbours, to co-operate with the NTC and the International Criminal Court, to ensure that Gaddafi and his inner circle are brought to justice.
Demobilise fighters, protect sub-Saharan migrants
EU assistance is needed in reforming the Libyan police and armed forces, as well as disarming, demobilising and reintegrating former combatants, said the resolution.
Parliament urged the NTC to protect the rights of minority and vulnerable groups, including thousands of sub-Saharan African migrants who face harassment solely due to their skin colour.
Manage natural resources for all
Finally, MEPs stressed that the NTC should impose high standards of transparency in domestic strategic economic sectors, so as to ensure that Libya's natural resources benefit the whole population”. Poland's Mikolaj Dowgielewicz during the debate Press Release on debate in plenary 14.09.2011
Eurozone crisis, energy, Syria and Libya key in 12-15 September plenary

MEPs also discussed the situation in Syria and Libya and called for better support of female entrepreneurs, while the Polish President said more Europe is the way out of the crisis. Find out more.
On 13 September MEPs approved an own-initiative report by German Green Reinhard Bütikofer calling for a more ambitious and innovative raw materials strategy , based on the efficient use and recycling of raw materials, to encourage sustainable development and a competitive industry. The report stressed the importance of guaranteeing a reliable and sustainable supply of raw materials for European industry.
There should be better financial and educational support for female entrepreneurs and it should be made easier for women over 50 to continue working or to move back into employment through life-long learning schemes and flexible retraining programmes, according to a resolution adopted Tuesday.
Following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Mexican Gulf last year, Parliament Tuesday adopted a report, calling for the highest safety and environmental standards for offshore oil and gas drillling . The EP wants drilling to be contingent on approval by national authorities.
Also Tuesday, MEPs approved a report by Portuguese Socialist Vital Moreira on the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual use items - items that could be used both for civilian and military purposes. It would include the setting up of a secure system for the collection, transmission, and storage of notifications and require the European Commission to inform the EP about the system's functioning.
European consumers should no longer pay unreasonably high prices for energy after the approval Wednesday of new rules on energy market integrity and transparency aimed at preventing abuses in wholesale energy trading.
The euro crisis was in the spotlight again Wednesday. During the debate Commission President José Manuel Barroso promised proposals on eurobonds, while the Polish Finance Minister warned that "if the eurozone breaks up, the EU won't survive for much longer". Two of the MEPs responsible for the economic governance package being negotiated with ministers, chatted with EP fans on Facebook Thursday.
In an address to MEPs Tuesday Polish President Bronisław Komorowski called for more Europe to respond to the crisis and defend the euro. Poland currently holds the rotating Council presidency.
On Wednesday morning, Polish deputy state secretary Jacek Dominik presented the Council's position on the EU budget for 2012 . The Council proposes an increase of the budget of 2.9% for commitments, compared with the Commission's proposal of 3.7%, but Mr Jacek said some member states would like to see zero budget growth. The EP will vote on its position in October.
Corruption costs the EU about €120 billion a year but MEPs believe EU countries lack the political will to act. The EP gave a red card to corruption Thursday when it called for better implementation and enforcement of existing legislation, improved cooperation and protection for whistleblowers.
MEPs called for Syria 's President Bashar al Assad to step down immediately in a resolution Thursday. They also welcomed the fall of Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year regime and called on Libya 's National Transitional Council to manage national resources for the benefit of all Libyans.
In Thursday's debate on human rights MEP's drew attention to the plight of Swedish-Eritrean journalist Dawit Isaak , who on 23 September will have spent 10 years in an Eritrean prison without charges, trial or a legal hearing. MEPs called for his immediate release. All the approved texts will be available here Catch up with all the photos from the session on Flickr
