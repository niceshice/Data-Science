Parliament also calls on Member States to help women over 50 to stay in or return to the labour market.
Only one in ten women in the EU is an entrepreneur, as opposed to one in four men. Parliament therefore calls on the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities to do more to publicise and improve take-up of funding opportunities for female entrepreneurs such as special grants, venture capital, social security provisions and interest rate rebates.
The European Progress Microfinance Facility, for example, provides micro-loans of up to €25,000 to micro-enterprises and to people who wish to start up their own business but who have no access to traditional banking services.
"In spite of all the constraints and restrictions faced by women today, a growing number of women have proved to be more than capable of creating successful businesses. Put simply, in a time of economic uncertainty, Europe can no longer afford to leave such a vibrant source of potential untapped!", said rapporteur Marina Yannakoudakis (ECR, UK)
Vocational training
The Commission should also promote vocational training,and best practice exchanges to foster entrepreneurship amongst women and propose an action plan to increase the numbers of female entrepreneurs, says the non-binding resolution, which was approved by a show of hands..
The EU's "Erasmus for young entrepreneurs" exchange programme, which offers up to 6 months' work experience with an entrepreneur in another EU country, should also be more widely promoted, say MEPs.
Getting women over 50 back to work
MEPs also call for measures to enable women over 50 to continue working or to move back into employment. Member States should include older women in life-long learning schemes and support flexible retraining programmes for older women, says a second non-binding resolution, also approved by a show of hands.
"It is impossible to reach the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy, concerning the 75% employment rate and reducing the number of those living in poverty by 20 million, if we do not manage to keep the age group of women 50+ on the labour market without discrimination.", said rapporteur Edit Bauer (EPP, SK).
Reducing the risk of poverty
As women's careers are likely to be slower, shorter and interrupted for longer than men's, they earn less, and hence contribute less, to personal pension accounts. This in turn increases the risk of poverty in old age. Parliament therefore calls for measures to combat discrimination, by tackling the stereotypes associated with gender and age discrimination, as part of the 2012 European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations.
