The main post-presidential election challenge for Ukraine's politicians and authorities is to stabilise the country politically and economically by reforming its constitution and establishing a social market economy, says Parliament in a resolution voted on Thursday. MEPs welcomed the fact that the presidential election met most free and fair election standards, with a range of candidates offering alternative political views.
Political and economic stabilisation in Ukraine entails constitutional reform, consolidating the rule of law, involving minorities in the political process, establishing a social market economy and combating corruption, says the resolution.
MEPs give a positive assessment of the way in which the elections were conducted, but nonetheless regret the adoption by the Verkhovna Rada of highly-controversial amendments to the presidential electoral law, proposed by the Party of Regions just a few days before the second round.
The country's electoral legislation should be reviewed and more transparency the financing of candidates and political parties is needed, says the resolution.
Ukraine's European aspirations and energy co-operation
Parliament acknowledges Ukraine's European aspirations, noting that it "may apply for membership of the EU like any European state that adheres to the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law".
The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement should ensure Ukraine's gradual integration into the EU internal market, including extending the four freedoms to Ukraine.
MEPs call for further agreements EU-Ukraine agreements to secure energy supplies, including a reliable transit system for oil and gas. They also call on Ukraine to ratify its accession to the Energy Community Treaty and to adopt a new gas law in compliance with the EU Directive on common rules for the internal market in natural gas (2003/55/EC).
Visa facilitation
The Council should mandate the Commission to revise the existing visa facilitation agreement with Ukraine in order to work on a roadmap towards visa-free travel for Ukraine, including the intermediate aim of abolishing existing visa fees, says the resolution.
