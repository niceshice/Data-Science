Can life ever be routine in Baghdad?
The situation in Iraq and what the European Union can do for the country and its long suffering people comes under the spotlight Wednesday. The EP debate will centre on a report by Portuguese Socialist Ana Gomes. In a press conference Tuesday, she said her report lays out ways to "build a democratic Iraq that is stable, unified and will respect human rights". Watch the debate live online from 1600 CET.
In preparing her report Ms Gomes travelled to Iraq to see the difficulties on the ground for herself. She wants a new strategy "different in qualitative and quantitative terms" to help Iraq. The Portuguese MEP also stressed the need for international engagement in the country. "We have a legal and moral duty to care about Iraq becoming the federal democratic state Iraqis have in their Constitution," she told the press conference.
Ms Gomes went on to say that "it is not about giving more money, it is about helping them to spend the money properly". She added, "Iraqis are very keen to have Europeans engaged with them."
She underlined the "central" role the European Parliament could play by supporting fellow MPs in Iraq's national parliament "in strengthening the monitoring role of the executive in the legislative process".

The report was adopted with an overwhelming majority by Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. However, it is not clear that consensus will be repeated in Plenary. The report will be voted on Thursday.
