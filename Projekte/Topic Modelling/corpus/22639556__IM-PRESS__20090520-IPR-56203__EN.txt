Irish nominees for the 2009 EP Prize for Journalism announced In May 2009, after a substantial increase in the amount of entries received, the Irish nominees for the European Parliament's 2009 Prize for Journalism were announced. Nominees were chosen to represent Ireland in three categories - print, television and radio.
A jury of three Irish journalists - Richie McCullen of INN, Jennifer O'Leary of City Channel and Gerry Fitzmaurice of the North County Leader met to discuss the entries in April and to decide which of them reflected the objectives set out by the prize - to increase awareness about the EU and in particular, the public's understanding of the EU institutions.
After much deliberation and many hours of listening, the members of the Jury selected three Irish nominees to compete with nominees from the EU's 26 other Member States for this year's European Parliament Prize for Journalism. All nominees will be invited to the award ceremony in Brussels on 16 October.
The Irish nominees are as follows:
Stephen Carroll , from RTÉ television , submitted an innovative news piece explaining the Lisbon Treaty to children/teenagers as part of the News 2 Day programme on RTÉ 2. All members of the Jury were extremely enthusiastic about this entry.
The winner of the print category was Jamie Smyth , European Correspondent with the Irish Times , whose series of articles entitled 'Lisbon Explained', were deemed to be interesting, understandable and informative.
Teresa O'Malley , from local radio station Midwest Radio , submitted a lively and entertaining report on former European Commissioner Padraig Flynn. Among the entries in that category, hers was deemed to be the most informative and entertaining.
