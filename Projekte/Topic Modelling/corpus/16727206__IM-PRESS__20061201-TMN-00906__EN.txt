Health and environment: Parliament protects consumers

What do bathing water quality, paedriatric medicines, battery recycling, food advertising rules and dangerous substances in toys have in common? All are areas in which this European Parliament, legislating jointly with the EU Council of Ministers, has helped make a real difference to citizens' lives.
Of all environmental proposals, the furthest-reaching and most important for the EP is without doubt the proposed REACH directive on the registration and authorisation of chemicals used in the EP. A specific sheet is devoted to it.

Health: developing medicines designed for children
It is estimated that over half the medicines administered to children in Europe have never been specifically evaluated for use in children. Pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to invest in developing treatments specifically for children or adapting existing medicines to their needs, mainly because this market is relatively small.
Yet an EU regulation adopted by the European Parliament in June 2006 should help to ensure that from January 2007 onwards, children get medicines tailored to their metabolism, rather than smaller doses of those designed for adults. This regulation will require pharmaceutical firms to present "paediatric investigation plans" (i.e. research and development programmes) to gather the data needed to develop specific treatments for children.
Incentives for this research will include a six-month "supplementary protection certificate" extending the period of patent protection for innovative medicines, as requested by Parliament. Pharmaceutical companies that adapt patent-expired adult medicines for paediatric use may also be granted a 10-year period of exclusivity for such use.
Paediatric research priorities will match a list of therapeutic needs to be drawn up by an impartial "Paediatric Committee" established within the European Medicines Evaluation Agency. Parliament ensured that this committee's members must have no financial interest in the pharmaceutical industry, and its opinions will be made public. Paediatric medicines: EP procedure file
Bathing water: strengthening quality standards
Respiratory and digestive ailments still affect 12% of bathers, 30 years after one of the EU's oldest and most popular environmental directives, on bathing water quality, first took effect. In January 2006, after three years of tough negotiations with EU Member States, Parliament succeeded in overhauling the 1976 EU Directive, with the aim of reducing these ailments by a third. It took these negotiations to the final stage of the co-decision procedure, conciliation, to toughen the directive's quality standards.
From 2015, when the new directive takes effect, quality monitoring will focus on two indicators judged essential by scientists (microbiological indicators of faecal contamination, E. Coli and Intestinal Enterococci), instead of the 19 parameters required today. To the existing three water quality categories ("excellent", "good", "poor") a fourth category ("sufficient") will be added, between "good" and "poor", at the request of Member States which were unable to guarantee satisfactory quality levels. However, Parliament managed to ensure that the criteria proposed for this category be significantly more stringent than those sought by EU Member States.
MEPS also managed to ensure that a whole series of information on water quality, which was often lacking, be made available in real time both online and on the spot: classification level, pollution detected (nature, cause, duration) and measures taken, reasons for bathing bans, etc. Bathing water quality: EP procedure file EP and Council Directive 2006/7/EC of 15 February 2006 on bathing water quality
Waste: collecting and recycling used batteries
About 800,000 tonnes of automotive batteries, 190,000 tonnes of industrial batteries and 160,000 tonnes of portable (consumer) batteries are placed on the EU market each year. Incinerating or landfilling them after use creates a serious heavy metal pollution hazard (e.g. lead, mercury, cadmium).
The start of 2009 will see the entry into force of an EU directive, adopted by Parliament in June 2006 after a conciliation agreement with the Council, that will require used batteries to be collected and recycled. At least 25% of all used batteries and accumulators must be collected by 2015 and at least 45% by 2019. Of these, between 50% and 75%, depending on battery type, must be recycled. From 2012, the most hazardous substances, such as cadmium, will have to be recovered in their entirety.
Parliament ensured that collection points which are easily accessible by consumers be put in place in 2011. Distributors will also be required to take back used batteries and portable accumulators without cost to the consumer, regardless of the date when batteries were placed on the market. All producers will have to be registered and, in line with the members' wishes, this registration will be subject to similar regulations in all Member States.
MEPS insisted that manufacturers be required to design their products so as to make batteries or accumulators easy to remove. They also managed to include a requirement for the capacity of all batteries to be clearly indicated on the packaging no later than the year after the date of the directive's transposition into national law.
Lastly, Parliament tailored the directive to encourage the use of more effective and environmentally-friendly recycling methods, and greatly reduced the exemption possibilities sought by EU Member States.

Foodstuffs: putting an end to false promises by industry
Claims such as "Low in salt", "high-fibre", "lowers cholesterol", are often found on food labelling - and they often mislead the consumer. In May 2006 the European Parliament gave the green light to an EU regulation that will govern such claims and even prohibit them where foods do not match very specific "nutritional profiles", i.e. have appropriate salt, sugar and fat ratios. After many months of negotiations with the Council, MEPs succeeded in ensuring that:
products intended for children will be subject to a specific authorisation procedure;
the impact of the new rules on consumers' choice of foodstuffs and on their health will be evaluated;
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be helped to comply with the new rules;
fresh products such as fruit and vegetables or bread will be excluded from the rules;
trademarked products may continue to be marketed for 15 years after the regulation's entry into force;
claims that were permitted in an EU Member State prior to 1 January 2006 may continue to be made for up to 3 years after the regulation's entry into force.
In parallel, Parliament approved a second regulation, governing the addition of vitamins and minerals to foodstuffs. At the MEP's request, a stipulation was included that only substances which are "bioavailable" (i.e. capable of being used by the body) and which are included in exhaustive lists will be permitted. The Commission will have to consult consumer associations and industry if it wishes to modify these lists. MEPs also called on the Commission to propose a regulation within two years to establish maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs.
Both regulations will enter into force progressively in summer 2007.

Toys: phthalates definitively banned
Phthalates, which are used to soften plastics, have been found to be carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction. In July 2005, the European Parliament adopted a directive providing for a definitive ban on the use, in toys and childcare products, of six phthalates that had been subject to a temporary ban since 1999.
The compromise reached with the Council just before Parliament's second reading plenary vote, led to a ban on the use of three phthalates, DEHP, DBP and BBP, in all toys and childcare products (*) where their concentration exceeds 0.1% by mass of the plasticised material. Before 1999, phthalate concentrations of up to 30% were not rare. The three other phthalates covered - DINP, DIDP and DNOP (*) - were prohibited, in excess of the same concentration, in toys and childcare products that children could put in their mouths, even if this was not their intended purpose. These bans are not subject to specific age ranges. Here MEPs prevailed over the Council, which had wished to authorise the use of phthalates in the second group in products for children over 3 years old.
Member States had until 16 January 2007 to comply with the new directive.
(*) DEHP: di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate; DBP: dibutyl phthalate; BBP: butyl benzyl phthalate; DINP: di-isononyl phthalate; DIDP: di-isodecyl phthalate; DNOP: di-n-octyl phthalate.
