Maize: Parliament against sudden abolition of intervention system

Parliament called on Thursday for more flexibility in the Commission's plans for scrapping the Community intervention system for the maize market from this year. A three-year transition period, reducing this annual public purchase system to zero, would be better for the sector, MEPs concluded.
With the plenary vote, the European Parliament has departed from the position advocated by rapporteur Béla Glattfelder (EPP-ED, HU) and the Agriculture Committee, who wanted to reject the Commission's proposal. The full Parliament instead voted for a package of amendments tabled by Socialist, Liberal and Green MEPs seeking to reduce public buying-in of maize gradually over a three-year period.
MEPs believe the sudden abolition of the intervention scheme as of this year would hit the new Member States hard, when spring sowing has already begun. They propose to cap the amounts of maize bought into intervention at 2 million tonnes for 2007/2008, 1 million tonnes in 2008/2009 and zero tonnes from 2009/2010.
Parliament also calls on the Commission to present by 31 December 2008 a report evaluating trends in the maize market, the economic situation of the sector and the possible abolition or extension of the intervention scheme, accompanied by fresh legislative proposals if appropriate.
During the debate preceding the vote, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, speaking on behalf of Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer-Boel, said the Commission would be "prepared to discuss a phased reduction in intervention stocks". The EP - whose amendments are not binding on the Council, which will soon adopt the draft regulation - has thus moved close to recent compromise proposals made to the Member States by the German presidency. This subject could be on the agenda of the next Agriculture Council on 11 and 12 June.
Differing views on the market situation
The EU intervention system for cereals (maize, wheat, barley and sorghum) consists of a single price of €101.31 per tonne paid to farmers who sell their crops into public storage if they cannot sell them on the market.
According to the Commission, Community stocks were 5.6 million tonnes in 2005/2006 and could reach 15.6 million tonnes by 2013. It stresses that growers in regions where production costs are lower and who are further from the main areas of consumption (chiefly Hungary) have an interest in selling into intervention rather than trying to export.
Parliament's rapporteur argued, on the basis of professional forecasts, that the Commission's analysis assumes a linear increase in stocks which does not reflect market trends: a currently high market price of around €120/tonne, a lower than average crop yield in 2006 and a fall in intervention stocks to 4.28 million tonnes at the end of 2006, together with an expected increase in world consumption and a growing biofuels market, which is set to be an important market for maize.
The EU-27 produces over 60 million tonnes of maize per year. France is the biggest grower with around 13 million tonnes, followed by Italy and Romania (about 10 million each) and Hungary (9 million).
