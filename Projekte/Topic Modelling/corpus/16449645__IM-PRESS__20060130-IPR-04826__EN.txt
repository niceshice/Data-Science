Following the disaster that occurred in Chorzów in Poland on Saturday, the President of the European Parliament, Mr Josep Borrell, issued the following statement:
" I was deeply shocked to learn of the terrible accident that occurred in Chorzów when the roof of an exhibition hall collapsed.
The disaster sadly resulted in the death of 67 people and injuries to 141 others from various countries around Europe, most of whom were pigeon enthusiasts.
At this time of grief and suffering, I should like to speak on my own behalf and on that of all of the Members of the European Parliament in expressing our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and conveying to them our sincerest condolences .
Today, in acknowledgement of the three days of national mourning declared in Poland, the Polish flag has been placed at half mast at the European Parliament."
