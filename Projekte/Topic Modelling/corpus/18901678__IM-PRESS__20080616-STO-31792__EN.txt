Mr Pöttering called for the ratification of the Lisbon treaty to continue The June plenary opened with a statement by Parliament's president Hans-Gert Pöttering on the Irish "No" vote on the Lisbon Treaty. He called on EU leaders meeting in Brussels for a summit on 19-20 June to ensure that the Treaty becomes a reality. He underlined that the ratification process must continue. He also told the House of the outcome of a recent delegation of MEPs to the Middle East. Poverty and exclusion and 40 years of the customs union also featured.
Mr Pöttering opened the session by saying that "the result of the referendum of 12 June 2008 in Ireland confronts the European Union with one of the most difficult challenges in its history". He went on to point out that "the Lisbon treaty is the answer to citizens' criticisms of the European Union. This treaty brings the European Union closer to its citizens".
As to what he believes should happen now Mr Pöttering told the House that "it remains our goal to see the Lisbon treaty enter into force before the elections of June 2009 to the European Parliament".
The whole Parliament will debate the "No" vote in the Irish referendum on Wednesday morning ahead of Thursday and Friday's summit of EU leaders and heads of state.
Delegation to Middle East pessimistic about Annapolis goals
A delegation of MEPs has just returned from Israel and the Palestinian Territories and Mr Pöttering told the House of their conclusions. He began by stating the need for concrete measures to realize the objectives laid down by the recent Annapolis conference - namely the achievement of a two-state solution by the end of the year. However, his comments were leavened by realism: "despite some encouraging progress, there is little reason for optimism in realizing the ambitious goals of Annapolis: this is the conclusion of the delegation" he said.
40 years of the customs union
A statement from the Commissioner for taxation and customs union László Kovács marked 40 years of the European customs union. Established on 1 July 1968 it has meant that there are no customs duties at internal borders between the EU Member States and common customs duties on imports from outside the Union. It has also led to the disappearance of many internal border controls.
Make 2010 a year for tackling poverty say MEPs
Approximately 78 million EU citizens – or 16% of the population – live at risk of poverty. Of these 19 million are children and 1 in 10 live in households where nobody works. Ahead of the start of the 2010 European year for combating poverty and social exclusion, a report by Greek MEP Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, (EPP-ED) calls for the year to focus on fighting child poverty and to pay special attention to large families, single parents, families caring for a dependent person and children in institutions. MEPs will vote on the report on Tuesday.
Waste and water directives
Also debated by MEPs on Monday evening in Strasbourg were two separate waste and water directives. The former sets strict new targets for recycling across the EU to be met by 2020 whilst the latter lists 33 pollutants for which higher health standards are required. A full look at the issues raised by these directives can be found in the second link below. A vote will take place on Tuesday on these draft directives.
