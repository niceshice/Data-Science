President Borrell opened the plenary session with reference to two tragic events that occurred recently: the crash of a Slovak army plane carrying peacekeepers from the NATO force in Kosovo on Thursday 19 January; and the accident that occurred on Saturday 28 January in Chorzów, when the roof of an exhibition hall collapsed and 62 people died.
On behalf of the European Parliament, President Borrell expressed his solidarity and condolences to the victims' families. He mentioned that both the Slovakian and Polish flags were flying at half-mast and that he had sent a letter of condolences to both Heads of State. One-minute of silence followed.
