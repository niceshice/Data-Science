A man rings possible jobs in a newspaper, a sight that could becomes depressingly more familiar. Â©BELGA/UPPA/Photoshot MEPs urged European leaders to act urgently to deal with the deepening economic crisis, ahead of an EU Summit on 19-20 March. They also stressed the need to avoid isolating individual countries and for there to be no economic demarcation lines in Europe. There were also discussions about the EU hopes of Croatia, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. There was a minute's silence for those killed in the school shooting in Winnenden, Germany.
Wednesday also marked the European day for victims of terrorism , coming five years after the Madrid train bombings which killed 191 and injured nearly 2000 people. Parliament's President spoke of the suffering of the victims of recent attacks in Northern Ireland and Sri Lanka calling terrorism a crime that can never be justified.
In the debate ahead of the EU Summit, MEPs from all sides urged governments to boost innovation and attempt to create "green collar" jobs. They also called for Europe's tax havens to come under greater scrutiny and for more financial supervision of markets.
Czech Europe Minister Alexandr Vondra, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said the economic crisis, financial supervision, climate change and Copenhagen conference and energy security would be on the agenda when heads of government meet.
EU hopes of Croatia, Turkey, FYROM discussed
The day also saw MEPs discuss the EU ambitions of Croatia, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The report on Croatia identified corruption, organized crime and boarder dispute with Slovenia as problems still to be solved.
The report on Turkey regretted the slowdown in institutional reform and problems concerning freedom of speech and media freedom. More progress in religious pluralism and social rights are needed, but the creation of a public television channel in the Kurdish is seen as a positive step forward.
With regards to FYROM MEPs regretted the fact that a date for the start of negotiations has not yet been set. There are other issues around elections and the name dispute with Greece.
Other items on the agenda
Jan Andersson's report on the employment crisis urged countries to invest 2% of their GDP in recovery measures.
An own-initiative report by Evgeni Kirilov urged speeding up the disbursement of Europe's cohesion funds to boost employment.
