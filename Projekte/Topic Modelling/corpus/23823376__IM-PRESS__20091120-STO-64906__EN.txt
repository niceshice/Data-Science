A female MEP votes on the telecoms package. Leader of the European People's Party Joseph Daul makes a quick official call from his place in the Chamber. Members mill around in the corridor outside the Hemicycle Chamber. A quick text to the office before the day's votes. "We have to make sure our group all votes the same way on this issue". A certain amount of coordination and plotting is done on phones in the corridors of the Strasbourg building. Although members are not supposed to use mobile phones in the Chamber many use them quietly while they wait for the Session to get underway. In a reflection of the fact that the building in Strasbourg was built before the ubiquitous use of mobile phones, public phones and phone boxes are a common sight. Saadet Işıl Aksoy, who starred in the film 'Eastern Plays' records the LUX prize ceremony. Wednesday 25 November. An online chat on the Parliament's Facebook page with Catherine Trautmann who steered the telecoms package through Parliament. An overview of the European Parliament's Chamber, Strasbourg, north east France During the 23-26 November plenary MEPs called for a binding agreement on emission targets ahead of the December Copenhagen conference on climate change. After two years of negotiations with Ministers they adopted the "telecom package", combining measures for internet freedom and protection of data. The 2009 LUX Prize was awarded to French film "Welcome".
Stormy weather as MEPs gather in Strasbourg. With heavy rain and strong winds lashing EP's workplaces in
Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, MEPs gathered for a November plenary in Strasbourg. Was nature reminding
them that a compromise must be reached for the Copenhagen climate change summit?
Copenhagen summit hopes: MEPs called on Wednesday for a binding ambitious agreement with emission reduction
targets for developed and developing countries as well as funding commitments and sanctions for non-compliance.
Let the efficient tyres roll: With tyres accounting for up to a quarter of the fuel consumption of a vehicle, good tyres are vital to reducing fuel and CO 2 emissions. From November 2012 all new tyres on sale in Europe will be classified and labelled for fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise performance, under a draft regulation backed by Parliament Wednesday.
Electronic communications reformed: On Tuesday the Parliament adopted new EU telecoms rules, which will strengthen the rights of phone users and internet surfers and boost competition among telecom firms. The new rules will come into force in 18 months and will enhance consumer rights, safeguard internet freedom, protect data, boost competition and modernise radio spectrum use.
Internet users Tuesday joined a Facebook chat with MEP Catherine Trautmann , who drafted the report on the telecom package. Questions on how Parliament reached a deal to protect internet users' rights dominated.
Keyboards caught fire during the Tuesday half-hour twittering session of the second-ever Question Time with Commission President Barroso. "Just today I received the final names of all 27 Commissioners designate," he said, adding that nine (a third) of the nominees are women .
The sun came out on Wednesday as the LUX Prize was awarded to French film "Welcome". The €87,000 that come with the prize will be used to subtitle the film in 22 languages and distribute it to European cinemas.
Also Wednesday, MEPs urged the Commission to take measures to protect passengers in the case of airline bankruptcies . MEPs suggest that the establishment of a "guarantee fund" for the compensation of passengers and the introduction of "mutual responsibility" for passengers of all airlines flying in the same direction with available seats, could help to get stranded passengers home.
MEPs want clear rules on origin marking to better inform and protect consumers. They believe that in future each EU country should use the same rule while indicating "made in" on clothes, shoes, bags, or electronic devices.
Marking the 10th anniversary of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, MEPs on
Thursday urged the Council and Commission to come up with an EU policy to tackle domestic violence against women.
Finally, the photos in the accompanying slideshow are on the subject of telecoms to mark a momentous week.
