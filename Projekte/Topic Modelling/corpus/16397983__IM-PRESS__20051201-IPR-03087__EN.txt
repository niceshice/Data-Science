A European Parliament delegation met the UK presidency on Wednesday 30 November to address the issues that scuppered last week's conciliation meeting on the 2006 budget. An agreement was reached on the level of payments for 2006 and special financing arrangements for the EU's external action.
The figure for payment appropriations will be €111,969 billion, equivalent to 1.01% of the European Union's gross national income. Gianni Pittella (PES, IT), Parliament's general rapporteur on the 2006 budget, said the result was "important in the light of the upcoming discussions on the next financial perspective, as the level of payments decided for 2006 is higher than that proposed in the Luxembourg and British compromises for 2007-2013" . It is important to bear in mind that, were there to be no agreement on the next financial perspective, it is the 2006 budget which would serve as the basis for negotiations to set subsequent annual budgets.
Janusz Lewandowski (EPP-ED, PL), chair of the Budgets Committee, also sees Wednesday's compromise as "a good omen" ahead of the EU summit in mid-December as well as proof that "the Parliament and Council can agree on complex financial dossiers" .
It should also be noted that, as with the 2005 budget, it will be possible to find extra funding for structural measures if money runs short in the course of the year.
Around €275 million is envisaged over and above the ceiling of the current financial perspective for the heading External action via the flexibility instrument. This was a major bone of contention at the conciliation between Parliament and Council (with the latter refusing to go above 200 million) but this use of the flexibility instrument will make it possible to finance reconstruction in Iraq and in countries hit by the tsunami of December 2004. It will also help the ACP countries (African, Caribbean and Pacific) affected by the sugar reform and provide more money for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP).
The total funding for the CFSP for 2006 rises to €102.6 million, an increase of 40 million compared to the 2006 preliminary draft budget. Information meetings on CFSP actions between MEPs and ambassadors representing the Council must now be held every three months.
Lastly, the Council accepted Parliament's request to provide €100 million in extra funding for a range of programmes directly affecting the public which are crucial to the Lisbon strategy: Life, Socrates and programmes for research, small and medium-sized firms, young people and cultural organisations.
