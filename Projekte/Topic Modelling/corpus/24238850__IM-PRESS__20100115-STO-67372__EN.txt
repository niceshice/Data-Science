There were a few rays of optimism with Jo Leinen MEP, the head of the EP delegation to Copenhagen saying the EU needed to find "strategic partners" in the run up to the next climate conference in November. Others welcomed progress on financing as developed countries committed $30 billion to help developing states adapt.
The word "disappointing" cropped up repeatedly during the afternoon's debate although many said the EU should continue to move forward and not become dependent on the commitments of others. Dutch EPP Member Corien Wortmann-Kool, who attended the conference, said that the EU's "30% must still stand". She went on to appeal for people not to lose hope: "We have to review our strategy but we still have to cling to our ambition."
French ALDE Member Corinne Lepage said, Europe had "to maintain our position as world leaders". She called for "a robust and ambitious strategy to move the economy in a more energy efficient direction."
At the conference there was movement on climate as all developed countries (including the US) agreed to work within the same international framework. The Copenhagen Accord, which is not legally binding, also includes a " method for verifying " developing nations' emission reductions. In addition developed countries committed themselves to pay $30 billion between 2010 and 2012 in climate support to developing countries.
However, the conference failed to come up with any legally binding targets.
Speaking in the plenary Finnish Green Satu Hassi ( Greens/EFA ) said for the first time in a UN document there is a reference to 2 degree limit. However, she also said "it is quite clear that there are some who wanted to sabotage the agreement" and called for a reform to the UN decision making system.
The EP is voting on the resolution of the results on COP15 in February's plenary. The next UN summit on climate change takes place in Mexico 29 November - 10 December 2010. The end of 2012 is the deadline for the ratification of a new global climate deal.
