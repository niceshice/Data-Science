As part of celebrating Cork as European Capital of Culture 2005, an exhibition of prints by Cork Printmakers, was officially opened by Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCREEVY on 11 October 2005 in the European Parliament in Brussels. Simon COVENEY (EPP-ED, IE), who hosted the event, stated that Cork had made a big impression. It is, he said, a prosperous and confident city, strong artistically with an immense cultural vitality.
In 1991, Cork Printmakers artists workshop was set up by a number of fine art printmakers in Cork City to support both established and emerging artists working in print media. The workshop became fully functional in 1998 and new members were invited to join. Today Cork Printmakers supports over eighty working artists based in Ireland, Britain and the United States.
The print techniques used to create a print include collograph, etching, lithography, mezzotint, monoprint, relief printmaking and screenprint. Further information and details of each process can be found on their website www.corkprintmakers.ie
Officially opening the exhibition, Commissioner McCreevy reminded people that the initiative for the "European -Capital of Culture" programme was inaugurated in 1985 by Melina Mercouri then Greek Minister of Culture, in order to forge closer ties between the citizens of Europe. He was proud to be opening this exhibition in the European Parliament and congratulated Cork on their achievements in many multiculture disciplines from art to music to design and sport, and their success in winning this year's All-Ireland Senior Hurling Final.
