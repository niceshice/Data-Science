"No terrorist or terrorist action will ever be able to diminish or destroy our faith in core values such as human rights and democracy" said European Parliament vice-president Gianni Pittella, in a message of solidarity towards victims of terrorism, on the anniversary day of the 2004 bomb attacks in Madrid."Today we honour the more than 5000 people killed in Europe, and show solidarity with the scores of people wounded, who have suffered the barbarity of terrorism" said M. Pittella.
"The bomb attacks in Madrid six years ago on 11 March 2004, which saw 191 victims from 17 countries, as well as the bombing in London on 7 July 2005, were some of the worst acts of terror perpetrated on European soil.
Terrorism is an attack on us all. Terrorism is an attack on the very fabric of our democratic society.
This is why Europe will always stand united in its fight against terrorism of all kind, whether separatist, religious or political.
Terrorism can never be justified. This European day gives us the opportunity to demonstrate that no terrorist or terrorist action will ever be able to diminish or destroy our faith in core values such as human rights and democracy" he added.
