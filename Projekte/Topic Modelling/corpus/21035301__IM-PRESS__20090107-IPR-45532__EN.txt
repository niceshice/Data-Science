The European Parliament Prize for Journalism will be awarded for the second time in October 2009. It will be awarded to journalists who have covered major European issues or promoted a better understanding of the EU institutions and/or EU policies. The prize will be awarded in four different categories: written press, radio, TV and internet. The winner in each category will receive â‚¬5 000.
Individuals or teams of up to five people are eligible to contribute with articles or reports. Contributions must have been published or broadcast between 1 May 2008 and 31 March 2009 in one of the official languages of the European Union. All participants must be nationals or residents of an EU Member State and registered journalists.
Entries will be accepted from 15 January until 31 March 2009 inclusive. The prize will be awarded in October 2009.
The competition will be judged in two stages. A "shortlist" jury in each of the 27 Member States, made up of journalists, will select national winners in each category. These will then be assessed by an "award jury" made up of three MEPs and six journalists in Brussels, who will choose four winners EU-wide. The "award jury" will be chaired by the European Parliament Vice-President in charge of Communication.
Application forms and the rules of the Journalism Prize are available on the website of the Prize at the link below.
The winners of last year's European Parliament Prize for Journalism came from the UK, Denmark, Romania, Austria, Germany and Finland.
