MEPs adopted a report on the conclusion of the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement. This new Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) will exercise its responsibilities for the effective conservation and management of non-tuna species in the high seas of the Southern Indian Ocean. The Community has fishing interests in the South Indian Ocean and is also a Coastal State on behalf of RÃ©union.
In 2000, the South Indian Ocean fishing states (the Comoros, France, Kenya, Mozambique, New Zealand and Seychelles) and the European Community together with FAO took the initiative to launch the process of setting up a new regional fisheries organisation (Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement).
The Community signed the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) on 7 July 2006, in conformity with the Council Decision No. 2006/496/EC adopted by the Council on 6 July 2006. On 21 December 2007, the European Commission forwarded to the Council a proposal for a decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the SIOFA. The Council decided on 30 January 2008 to consult the European Parliament on this agreement and sent a request for consultation.
The only amendment adopted by the European Parliament concerns the legal basis of this dossier, since the committee considers that it is not a case of consultation, but rather of assent. The report was adopted with 646 votes in favour, 26 against and 14 abstentions.
