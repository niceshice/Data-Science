Hubner: Parliament gives you freedom of expression
Institutions

Danuta Hubner MEPs come from all walks of life including other EU institutions. So just how much cross-over is there and how does the experience impact on their work? Over coming months, we will talk to some of the people who have moved across institutions. First up is Polish EPP member Danuta Hubner, who was Commissioner for Regional Policy from 2004-2009 and is currently the chair of the Regional Development Committee.
Does your work in different EU institutions help you now?
I was really lucky to work in the three most important ones: as a Polish minister in the Council, as a Commissioner and now in the Parliament. Every institution is different: they have their own place in the EU structure and a different work culture.
The fact that I know the other institutions is very helpful. The biggest difference for me is the freedom of expression. When you're a minister or a commissioner you have some constraints, you have to take many factors into consideration. Here, in the EP, it is different. MEPs can have doubts, we can discuss, we can ask difficult questions. You don't have this comfort in the Commission or in the government.
How is your work different?
I deal with similar themes - European issues and regional policy. But in the EP I can also do other things, in the Commission I had to stick to my field. I joke that it means that I have even more work now, something I thought was not possible when I worked in the Commission.
There's also a political side. For the first time I'm an elected official. Meetings with constituents are always very important, nice and also personal. I think they're vital for everyone who's a politician or an official. Everyone who can influence people's lives should experience them.
With your background, is it easier to negotiate with the Commission and Council?
It is not only about the connections, but also about the knowledge of the inner workings of the Commission. Now, as the head of the Regional Committee I work closely with the Commission and because I know the people there it is easier. I set up a contact group that regularly stays in touch with my former colleagues and it makes our work smoother.
