270 young journalists from across the EU met at the European Parliament in Brussels this week for the first European Youth Media Days event. They debated issues of European interest with MEPs and Commission and Council representatives and put together media products, ranging from radio shows through photo reportages to internet TV, that provided a kaleidoscope of political, social and cultural views of Europe.
Opening the event, EP President Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, welcomed this opportunity for the EU to listen to what young people have to say. "Young people do not feel their voices are heard", he said, stressing that "we need your input in shaping our society". Specifically, he called upon the young journalists to "keep an open mind to look beyond national perspectives" when discussing the EU's future.
The event was co-organised by Parliament and the European Youth Press network. The participants (average age 23) were selected from among more than 2,000 applicants, and came from all EU countries.
An article on the event, prepared by the young journalists, has been published on the homepage of Parliament's web site.
