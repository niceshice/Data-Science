Were flights in and out Europe used to transport terror suspects?
After a year of hearings and the testimony of 172 persons including 3 victims, Parliament's Temporary Committee on alleged CIA activities in Europe has submitted a report to be voted on today. The charges are as follows: was the CIA engaged in "extraordinary rendition" (moving alleged terror suspects clandestinely around the world), detention or torture in Europe? If so, was international law breached and were EU states and citizens involved either as victims or collaborators?
There are 270 amendments to be voted upon today. When voted on in the Committee the report had 28 in favour, 17 against with 3 abstentions.
"illegal seizure...abduction and detention of terrorist suspects"
In July the Parliament adopted the Committee's interim report which stated that in some cases the CIA was involved in the "illegal seizure, removal, abduction and detention of terrorist suspects" in Europe. It also criticised the involvement and complicity by certain EU members in the practice.
However, on the charge of whether secret detention centres had been operating in the EU, it noted that the "temporary committee has so far not revealed any evidence or proof of the existence of secret prisons in the EU".
In September 2006 US President George W. Bush admitted the existence of secret prisons for terror suspects although he denied torture was ever used.
The Parliament's Temporary Committee has been jointly chaired by Carlos Coelho of the European People's Party and Claudio Fava of the Socialist PES Group. They presided over 30 meetings, conducted 7 foreign visits to investigate the allegations and involved governments, NGOs, EU representatives and journalists in their deliberations.
