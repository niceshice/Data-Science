Encouraging more cycling is a key part of mobility week
It could have been a bit quieter and healthier than usual in your town or cities as Europe celebrates "car free day". Nearly 1300 European towns and cities have opted to persuade or forbid people from using their cars. It all formed part of "European Mobility Week" from 16-22 September which aims to make people consider greener methods of transport. With 216 million cars on the road in the EU - just a small percentage reduction in their usage would have a huge impact on the environment.
Pollution from road transport accounts for 21% of the EU carbon dioxide emissions - the gas responsible for global warming. At present half of all car journeys in the EU are less than 6 kilometres and 10% are less than kilometre. With 80% of all Europeans living in urban areas, walking, cycling, taking the bus or tram could be viable options to replace the car.
Legislative action to try and make a difference
Next week in Strasbourg MEPs will vote on a report that backs the establishment of Sustainable Urban Management Plans (SUMP) for towns above 100,000 people. Some of its proposals are to encourage non-motorised transport - walking and cycling - and environmentally friendly transport using bio-fuel and hybrid technology. Hungarian MEP Gyula Hegyi is the author of the report which is backed by Parliament's Environment committee.
Earlier this month, MEPs endorsed the "polluter pays" principle by supporting a report on car taxation for polluting vehicles put forward by Danish Liberal Karin Riis-JÃ¸rgensen. The recommendations will be sent to EU transport ministers.
Cleaner air quality in the EU will be the subject of two reports next week when MEPs meet in Strasbourg. German Liberal Holger Krahmer has a report on cleaner air for Europe and Dutch Socialist Dorette Corbey will present a report on a strategy on air pollution. They contain measures to limit emissions and improve air quality.
In October, Parliament will vote on a report from the transport committee on revising emissions restrictions for heavy vehicles. The current emissions limits will be replaced in late 2009 by tougher standards and MEPs strongly supported the new rules which will revise down vehicle emissions of chemicals like nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons.
Saving the planet starts at home
These are some of the words that, if acted upon, can make a difference: Save, reduce, turn down, switch off, share, walk, and cycle, insulate, reuse, recycle and recharge. The Parliament has recently launched its own ECO-management and audit scheme aiming to improve its environmental performance. This means applying best practice, training staff to raise their environmental awareness and promoting public transport. A recent bicycle scheme for staff and MEPs has also proved popular.
