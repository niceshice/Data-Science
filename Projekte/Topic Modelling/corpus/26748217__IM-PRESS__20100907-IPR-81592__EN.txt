Europe needs a "green" jobs strategy by 2011, says a resolution approved by Parliament in plenary session on Tuesday.
The resolution, drafted by Elisabeth Schroedter (Greens/EFA, DE) calls on the European Commission, to propose, by 2011, a strategy accompanied by legislative and non-legislative measures to encourage "green" job creation.
It urges the Commission to develop specific policies to facilitate the transition to a green economy, in particular through the redeployment of workers and aid for European industry to meet environmental needs.
The EU 2020 strategy, although focusing on growth and employment, missed the opportunity to develop the job-creating potential of a new, sustainable economy, stresses the resolution.
Training
National education and training systems must be adapted to re-skill workers affected by the transition to a new, sustainable economy, says the text.
European funds
Member States must use the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to achieve European aims and foster new skills for new sustainable, ecological and high-quality jobs, say MEPs. The EU's regions must also use EU structural and cohesion funds to create sustainable new jobs, they add.
Incentives for companies
Lastly, incentives are needed to encourage companies to invest in clean technologies, say MEPs, who call for effective financing systems and tax breaks to help small businesses to gear their hiring strategies to environment protection, innovation, and ecological production methods.
