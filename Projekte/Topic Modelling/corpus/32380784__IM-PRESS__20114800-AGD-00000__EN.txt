This Human Rights Conference and Sakharov Prize Network event provides a timely occasion to discuss the powerful role of new technologies in the battle for human rights. Moreover, it also gives an ideal opportunity to look at human rights issues in countries in transition, especially in light of current international developments such as the Arab Spring.
Human rights issues are always at the top of the Parliament's agenda. The conference wants people engaged in the struggle for human rights around the World to look at Brussels as not only as the European Union's capital, but also as a human rights hub. It starts at 10.30 a.m. in room 4Q2, József Antall (JAN) building.
The event will close with a public debate at the BOZAR Cultural Centre in the evening in Brussels, starting at 19:30.
