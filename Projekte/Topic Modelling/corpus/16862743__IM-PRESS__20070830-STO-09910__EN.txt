Elena Valenciano: report calls for more EP involvement in human rights dialogues
Rather than shun and isolate countries which have less than ideal human rights records, the EU uses political and economic "soft power" to induce changes. On Wednesday MEPs debated a report that calls for the Parliament to be informed of such dialogues. The report warns against sacrificing human rights for "geo-strategic" alliances and wants clearer monitoring of progress. In Strasbourg rapporteur Elena Valenciano of the Socialist group spoke to us about her report.
Tell us what human rights dialogues actually are?
Human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries represent one of the EU's main instruments for promoting and defending human rights through its foreign policy. The basic aim is to improve the human rights situation and the quality of life of the population of the country concerned.
Dialogues are based on reciprocity and mutual respect between the parties and start at the initiative of the Council, after evaluating the situation in the country. There are no specific criteria to initiate a dialogue. The country concerned must however be willing.
Do they have any results?
It is very difficult to evaluate the overall results obtained. Although we always hope for greater progress, in certain countries small steps in the right direction have been made. That said, the ongoing human rights situation remains very worrying in many cases, and an improvement in the established processes is necessary.
In your report you say that the different ways of conducting human rights dialogues make measuring progress impossible. Can you explain?
We accept that some flexibility is necessary as the circumstances of each country and region differ considerably. However, both the management and the evaluation criteria must be coherent to avoid an Ã  la carte approach to the dialogues and therefore unequal treatment in the EU's external relations, which can seriously undermine their credibility and legitimacy. Such criteria must be measurable
Your report warns against putting geo-politics before human rights. Please explain this.
We draw attention to the danger of subordinating human rights to other interests. We stress this especially with reference to the EU's economic and commercial activities - human rights must not be relegated to a second level. EU action to promote human rights should not be reduced to a mere conscience-saving exercise.
Should this principled approach apply to the EU's energy supplies?
Energy policy in particular must contribute to the promotion and safeguard of human rights, the democracy and the rule of law. Our energy needs can make this work more complicated, but they cannot serve as an excuse for the shattering of our commitment to the defence of human rights.
What role can the European Parliament play in this?
Until now the EP could be considered the great absentee in this important external action mechanism on human rights. This is why we propose to strengthen its role in the development of these dialogues and consultations.
We ask that Parliament be brought fully within the loop by Council and Commission. It is both feasible and desirable that the EP be involved in key decisions, such as those on the establishment or suspension of dialogues and their preparation. The Parliament, as moral guarantor of the EU's external action, can and must play an essential role for the maintenance of coherence and transparency of this instrument. That will make it more effective.
Elena Valenciano has been a Spanish member of the European Parliament since 1999. She is the PSE spokeswoman on the Parliament's Human Rights Sub-Committee. MEPs will vote on her report Thursday.
