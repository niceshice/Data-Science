MEPs will debate plans to give children fruit at school A recent report found that children in Europe are not getting enough fruit and vegetables, so the European Commission is proposing to set aside money to ensure they get weekly fruit. However, MEPs on the Agriculture Committee don't think that is enough and want more money made available so children get a daily allowance of fruit. MEPs will debate the issue on Tuesday at 1100 CET.
The World Health Organisation recommends 400g a day of fruit and vegetables, but a report for the Agriculture Committee found children's intake falling below this.
In parallel to this are the estimated 22 million overweight children in the EU - of whom 5 million are considered obese.
According to MEPs on the Agriculture Committee the consumption of fruit and vegetables not only prevents obesity but also reduces the risk of many diseases. It is crucial to start as early as possible - eating habits are established in childhood.
MEPs want daily, not weekly allocation
European Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel has proposed that €90 million be allocated from the EU budget to subsidise 1 piece of fruit for children aged 6 to 10 at least once a week.
Agriculture MEPs say this is not enough. They want an extra €500 million to ensure one piece of fruit or vegetable per day for pre-school and school age children.
According to the Committee the scheme should cover only fresh fruit and vegetables produced within the EU. The fruit and vegetables would preferably be seasonal, grown locally and bio-friendly.
Watch the debate on school fruit live online from Strasbourg from 11.00 am.
