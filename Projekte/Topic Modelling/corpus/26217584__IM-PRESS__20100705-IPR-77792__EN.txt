Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek opened this week's Strasbourg session by voicing sorrow at the recent floods in Romania, Asturias (Spain) and other parts of Europe. He also condemned recent attacks on the Baha'i community in Iran and the ongoing use of the death penalty there, including for minors. Lastly, he highlighted the 10th anniversary of the death of Polish wartime resistance fighter Jan Karski, the first person, in 1942, to report on the extermination of Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe.
The House approved two changes to this week's agenda. The vote on the Gallo report on intellectual property rights was postponed to September, and the order of debates on urgent topics on Thursday afternoon will now be Zimbabwe, Venezuela, North Korea.
