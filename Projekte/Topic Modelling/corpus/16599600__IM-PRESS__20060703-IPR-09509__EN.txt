UK to receive €9.47 billion in structural fund support
On 4 July, the Parliament voted in favour of a new €308 billion package of structural funds money for 2007-13. UK MEPs and organisations react to the next generation of funding. The reports adopted define the objectives, the financial resources available and the criteria for their allocation in an enlarged EU. Around 35.7 per cent of the total EU budget will now be available to spend, as scheduled, from 1 January 2007.
According to the European Commission's latest figures, the UK will receive some €9.47 billion from 2007-13. The structural funds aim to increase solidarity and reduce disparities between regions of the EU.
Before the money can finally be allocated to the Member States, the Commission will draw up, most likely in late July, Community Strategic Guidelines, on which Parliament will vote (under the assent procedure) in September. These are the starting point for the national reference frameworks and operational plans to be negotiated between the Commission and individual Member States in the Autumn.
There are a huge number of players in the structural funds debate. Different regions and nations within the UK have very different ways of dealing with their delivery. Without painting this complex picture in full, here is a snapshot of what some of those who will be most affected by the Structural funds 2007-13 in the UK have to say as the focus shifts from the European Parliament's role in the approving and shaping the funding to discussions at the national level.
The UK structural funds map will look very different this time round. In Scotland for example 40-60% less funding will be received because of the redirection of funds to the new EU Member States whose economies are poorer than the average of the EU-15.
UK MEPs' reaction in the debate on Tuesday 5 July 2006
Graham Booth (UKIP, IND/DEM, South West) said "Mr President, the last time I saw a printed copy of the budget for the Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period 2007-2013 it stood at EUR 336 billion, with a precise allocation budgeted for each of the 25 Member States plus the next two in the queue, Bulgaria and Romania. Looking at it from Britain’s point of view, it did not make good reading, so I put the following question to the Committee on Regional Development. I have carefully studied the budget for 2007-2013, totalling EUR 336 billion, which I call Plan A, and I see that EUR 139 billion of the total is being allocated to eight of the latest new Members and another EUR 22 billion to Bulgaria and Romania, with a meagre EUR 12 billion allocated to Britain during that period. If Britain should decide to withdraw from the EU and thus cancel its contribution, do you have a Plan B? There was of course a deathly hush, but such a situation is far from impossible. When the British public finally realises where all its money is going and when the Health Service in particular is so short of funding, a public call for withdrawal is quite likely."
Alyn Smith (SNP, Greens/EFA, Scotland) said: Mr President, today represents the end of a good piece of work by this Parliament, a good piece of work by the Commission and a rather less good piece of work by the Council, in particular a number of Member States within it – sadly, my own among them. I assure colleagues that I will not start apologising for the short-sighted mean-spiritedness of the United Kingdom Government, because I have only a minute of speaking time. This is not the package we wanted, but there is more in it to like than dislike. The strengthening of the partnership principle continues to need defence. Statistical effect is of crucial importance to regions across Europe. Accessibility for disabled people and crucially the abolition of double standards between so-called ‘old’ and ‘new’ Member States are all to be welcomed. Europe is not about coal and steel any more; it is not about agriculture and fisheries: it is about solidarity and cohesion, it is about where the EU adds value to regional development across the EU. This package takes us forward and my group will be supporting it.
Other reactions
Heleen Jalvingh from the Local Government International Bureau says: "In our response to UK Government consultation earlier this year we pleaded strongly for enhancing the involvement of local partnerships in the delivery of future structural funds programmes to ensure that funds are used to tackle the problems closest to communities. Local councils have gained a lot of experience and have a strong track record in helping to deliver the funds. This should be used for the 2007-13 Structural Funds Programmes. The LGIB now hopes that the UK Government will implement this focus on local authorities in their final national reference framework."
The Scottish Parliament's European and External Relations Committee produced a report at the end of June 2006 which urged the Scottish Executive to act quickly to maximise the potential of the Structural Funds. Although with the current round's large reduction they now make up a relatively small and decreasing amount of the total funds available for regional and economic development in Scotland, it is now all the more important best use is made of what is available. The Convenor of the Committee , Linda Fabiani MSP said: "Structural Funds have a very real effect on a wide variety of organisations across Scotland be they involved in enterprise, social, voluntary or environmental projects."
On the other hand, It has been confirmed that Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly is likely to receive a Convergence programme approximately a third larger than the current Objective 1 programme, in the region of £500m. Structural fund policy in future will be driven by the Lisbon (competitiveness) and Gothenburg (sustainability) Agendas. This is because the EU has set itself the goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. Any regional or sub-regional programme will need to clearly demonstrate how it contributes towards this aim. This will mean a significant increase in emphasis on competitiveness, innovation and the knowledge economy.
David Whalley, Leader of Cornwall County Council, says: "As an EU Convergence Region Cornwall is looking for a strong partnership with Government and the Regional Development Agency. If this is put in place Cornwall stands its best chance of once again becoming a dynamic and innovative economy."
One of the MEPs' major demands is for the strengthening of the partnership principle: namely that any other appropriate body representing civil society, environmental partners, non-governmental organisations and bodies responsible for promoting equality between men and women can take part in the structural funds partnership negotiations.
Geoffrey Brown, Director of EUCLID, the UK's cultural contact point for the structural funds says : "From the current round of Structural Funds (2000-2006), the arts and cultural sector has so far received over £250 million for over 700 projects, building-based developments, training schemes and other initiatives.
The next step will be for the English regions and Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to make decisions about their Single Programming Documents (SPDs) and the criteria they will use to allocate the funds that their region or country will receive. This new round of Structural Funds places an even greater emphasis on the importance of creating the knowledge-based economy. The broad cultural sector has a major role to play in this. Investment in culture - in production and provision and to address economic and social challenges - delivers significant benefits. Examples of such benefits and impact of culture are now evident across the whole of the UK - from the Angel of the North to the Tate St Ives.
A special conference on 5 July at the Tate Modern will provide an opportunity to draft a manifesto, the first of its kind for the cultural sector, to make sure we argue a strong case for a fair share of these funds."
