Smile and be happy with the European Health Card! The holiday season has arrived. Your suitcases are packed, your neighbours are watering the plants and feeding the cat and your tickets are ready. But have you also thought about bringing your European Health Insurance Card? When travelling abroad, you may decide to bring your own European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), to get access and cover your possibly needed medical treatments. The card is available free of charge through your local health authority.
European Health Insurance across borders
Free movement in all 27 EU countries is one of the prime achievements of the European Union. EU Citizens have the right to travel without restrictions. To be able to profit from this freedom, citizens also need simple reimbursement of necessary health care they receive abroad. The EU has therefore adopted legislation for issuing one single European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) that replaces the different forms (in particular the well known E111) that were previously used.
The Parliament was keen on having the card quickly introduced and MEPs therefore adopted only a few amendments, merely asking the EU members to ensure that the individuals concerned would be informed of their rights and obligations.
Since 1 January 2006 it has been issued and is recognised in all the EU Member States as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.
The EHIC: some practical information
The EHIC makes it easier to obtain access to public sector health care (for example a doctor, a pharmacy, a hospital or a health care centre) and medical treatment you may need while staying temporarily in another country. The treatment is provided in accordance with the rules of the country that you are visiting, and the costs incurred are reimbursed in line with the tariff scales applied in that country.
The EHIC covers only medical care which becomes necessary during a stay in another EU country, so in principle the card is not issued for deliberately seeking medical treatment in another Member State. You can only make use of the EHIC if you go to a health care provider covered by the health insurance scheme provided for by law in the host State.
If you are insured, or covered, by a statutory social security system in one EU country, you are entitled to an EHIC. Each Member is responsible for producing and distributing the EHIC on its territory. To request a card, you should contact your health institution.
So, bring your EHIC, or a provisional replacement certificate, with you while travelling abroad, but try to avoid needing it. Have a nice vacation! For more information, click on the link to the EHIC website.
The production and distribution of the European Health Insurance Card is carried out exclusively by the authorities of EU Member States. Therefore, the information in this article is provided only as a guide with the aim of helping the reader to find information.
