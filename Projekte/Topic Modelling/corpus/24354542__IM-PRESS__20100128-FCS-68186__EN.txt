Monday: Opening of Strasbourg session: vote on new Commission the highlight of the week
At the start of this week's plenary session in Strasbourg, Parliament President Jerzy Buzek commented on tomorrow's vote on the new European Commission, the Ukrainian presidential elections and the death of a former EP colleague in Haiti.
Tuesday: Parliament approves new European Commission
The European Parliament elected the new European Commission by 488 votes to 137, with 72 abstentions in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The vote took the form of a single ballot on the whole College of Commissioners, consisting of one Commissioner from each of the 27 EU member states.
Wednesday: EU enlargement: keep on reforming to stay on track
Parliament has given a positive overall verdict on last year's efforts by Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to qualify for EU membership. In resolutions debated and approved on Wednesday, MEPs also underlined the limited progress made by Turkey towards meeting the "Copenhagen" EU eligibility criteria for EU membership.
Wednesday: Male-female equality: tackle violence and guarantee paternity leave, say MEPs
In its annual report on equality between men and women in the EU, Parliament called on Wednesday for greater efforts to tackle violence against women, for paternity leave to be addressed at EU level and for equal pay legislation to be revised. A majority of MEPs also say women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, through easy access to contraception and abortion.
Wednesday: Better housing for poor communities
Poor communities in all Member States could get EU regional funding for renovation or replacement of their housing, under a regulation approved by the European Parliament on Wednesday.
MEPs call for swifter response and tighter coordination in the Eurozone
MEPs generally urged the Commission and the Council to use the current difficulties in the eurozone to take firm action in favour of more binding economic coordination as well as to respond more quickly in the future so as to avoid tension on the financial markets.
Addressing the plenary on the difficult monetary, economic and social situation of eurozone countries, the Council presidency representative Diego López Garrido said "the situation of the public deficit is a clear result of the crisis coupled with strong financial intervention by governments to prevent the collapse of the financial system". On the monetary situation, he said that "despite tension on the stock market, the EU has acted adequately" and "incentives in place should not yet be abandoned".
SWIFT: MEPs still concerned about data protection in interim agreement
In a debate on Wednesday most of Parliament's political groups restated their concern at the lack of data protection and legal redress in the provisional agreement on bank data transfers to the United-States via the SWIFT network. "The Council has made some encouraging signs but it didn't go beyond that", said the EPP speaker. The S&D, ALDE, Greens and GUE groups spoke out firmly against the agreement, while the ECR said it needed more time for reflexion.
SWIFT VOTE : European Parliament votes down agreement with the US
Parliament refused on Thursday to give its consent to the EU's interim agreement on banking data transfers to the USA via the SWIFT network, amid concerns for privacy, proportionality and reciprocity. This move renders the text signed between the US and the 27 EU Member states legally void. MEPs propose to negotiate a new agreement.
EU position on blue fin tuna ban debated Tuesday
The fate of blue fin tuna hangs in the balance this week as a complete ban on the trade is debated by MEPs. Ahead of a meeting of the Convention for the Protection of Endangered Species (CITES) the European Union must thrash out a position on whether to support a ban proposed by Monaco. The Union is divided although recently two key states, France and Italy, have swung around behind stopping the trade. The debate on Tuesday will be crucial to establishing a consensus.
A look back at what happened in Parliament this week
MEPs' rejection of the SWIFT EU-US data sharing agreement brought the parliamentary week to a dramatic close as the EP defied European governments. Also this week Members voted in a new executive for the EU, discussed further expansion of the Union, the eurozone, Iran and body scanners at airports. Blue fin tuna got a new lease of life as MEPs strongly supported putting them on a UN list of species in which trade is prohibited. The photo slideshow conveys some of the images of the week.
112 a mystery? Reading this could save your life
If you are unaware of what the phone number "112" means then reading this article could literally save your life. It is the free pan-European emergency number that can be dialled from anywhere inside the 27 countries of the European Union. So, if you are abroad and you need the police, ambulance or fire brigade then you should dial this number. The number does not replace national emergency numbers, but acts in parallel with them. Today is "112 day" and MEPs are keen to raise awareness.

A look through the week ahead 8-11 February
Parliament votes on the new Commission
MEPs vote on the election of the European Commission on Tuesday afternoon. They may elect or reject the new College of Commissioners, which will hold office for the next five years. Parliament will also vote on a resolution on a new cooperation agreement between the two institutions and on resolutions by the political groups setting out their views of the Commission.
EU membership candidates: keep on reforming to stay on track
Parliament is expected to give a positive overall assessment of last year's efforts by Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to qualify for EU membership. It is also expected to underline the limited progress Turkey has made towards meeting the "Copenhagen" EU eligibility criteria, in resolutions to be debated and approved on Wednesday (10 February).
SWIFT: Parliament to vote on interim accord
Next Thursday in Strasbourg MEPs will have the final say on the provisional nine-month agreement signed by EU government ministers on the transfer of bank data to the United States for counter-terrorism purposes. A rejection by MEPs - as recommended on 4 February by the EP Civil Liberties Committee - would render the agreement legally void.
Use of body scanners for security in airports
Plans to use body scanners in airport security checks, following the December 2009 failed bomb attack on a flight to Detroit, will be debated by MEPs with the Council and Commission on Tuesday afternoon. An impact evaluation report on body scanners is to be published by the Commission in the coming weeks.
Resolutions on Haiti, Iran and Yemen
On Wednesday (10 February) Parliament will adopt resolutions on Haiti, Iran and Yemen following debates at its January plenary session in Strasbourg on developments in these countries.
Marginalised communities could get EU regional funds for housing
Poor communities could get EU regional funding in all Member States for renovation or replacement of their houses, according to a regulation to be put to the vote on Wednesday.
Gender equality: fighting domestic violence and ensuring the right to paternity leave
Parliament will debate and vote on the annual report on equality between women and men in the European Union for 2009. Gender equality should be mainstreamed into all policy areas, say MEPs, to improve the lot of women and remedy the effects of the financial, economic and social crisis on their personal lives and position in the labour market.
Resettlement of Guantánamo detainees
Since the Guantánamo Bay prison has not been closed as originally scheduled on 22 January by the US administration, MEPs, Council and the Commission will discuss possible cooperation with the US for resettling prisoners.
Preventing needle-stick injuries in the health sector
Parliament will vote on an agreement between the European social partners to prevent needle-stick injuries in hospitals, one of the most widespread and serious risks to health workers across the EU.
Copenhagen climate change summit
MEPs will vote on a resolution on the outcome of the December 2009 climate change summit in Copenhagen. In a debate on 20 January, they said the agreement reached there was weak and a huge disappointment. MEPs stressed that EU needs to do more and speak with one voice. Some also said that UN negotiating methods should be revised.
On-line gambling: restrictions may be justified
MEPs want to know how the Commission plans to respond to a recent European Court of Justice decision upholding the right of the Portuguese authorities to ban a foreign on-line gambling site, given that the Commission itself has brought infringement proceedings against many EU Member States for failing to respect the free movement of services.
Ukraine after the presidential elections
The situation in Ukraine following the second round of presidential elections on 7 February will be the subject of a debate in Strasbourg on Wednesday. Parliament will vote on a resolution at its February II plenary session (25 February).
A ban on trade in blue fin tuna and polar bears?
Parliament will vote on a resolution calling on the European Commission and EU Member States to back a ban on international trade in endangered animals or their products, such as blue fin tuna and polar bears, and to maintain an existing ban on trade in African elephants.
Situation of Opel in Europe
Following a Commission statement, MEPs will debate the situation of Opel in Europe, in particular in the light of the closure of the company's Antwerp plant, announced on 21 January.

Opening of Strasbourg session: vote on new Commission the highlight of the week
Jerzy Buzek hands the floor to one of the leaders of the political groups. Monday 8 Feb At the start of this week's plenary session in Strasbourg, Parliament President Jerzy Buzek commented on tomorrow's vote on the new European Commission, the Ukrainian presidential elections and the death of a former EP colleague in Haiti.
The president first expressed sorrow at the death following the earthquake in Haiti of Ms Pilar Juárez Boal, head of the EU delegation in Haiti and a former EP official. He then commented on the outcome of the presidential elections in Ukraine, saying he had been told by MEPs who had observed the polls that, despite some complaints, the elections had followed the procedures.
He now believed that "democracy is well rooted in that country" and looked forward to good working relations between the EU and Ukraine. A debate on the Ukrainian elections is on Parliament's agenda for this Wednesday. Lastly, Mr Buzek drew attention to Tuesday's key votes on the election of the new Commission and the framework agreement on cooperation between the Commission and Parliament.
Two changes to the week's agenda were approved by the House. On Tuesday afternoon at 3pm a debate will take place on Eurozone countries in difficulty and on Wednesday the debates on progress towards enlargement by Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey will be merged into a joint debate.

Parliament approves new European Commission
The whole prospective College of Commissioners was in Strasbourg for the debate. The European Parliament elected the new European Commission by 488 votes to 137, with 72 abstentions in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The vote took the form of a single ballot on the whole College of Commissioners, consisting of one Commissioner from each of the 27 EU member states.
The new Commission will stay in office until 31 October 2014. By way of comparison, the first Barroso Commission was voted into office in November 2004 by 449 votes to 149, with 82 abstentions.
Ahead of the election, the EPP, S&D and ALDE groups announced that they would vote in favour of the college of Commissioners. The Greens, GUE/NGL and EFD groups said they would vote against the new college and the ECR group announced it would abstain.
"The dawn of a new decade": debate on new Commission elected by MEPs
During the debate held debate on Tuesday morning, Parliament's President, Jerzy Buzek said, "This is the first time in our history that we are appointing the European Commission in our capacity as a real co-legislator. This is the dawn of a new decade, with a new way of working for the European institutions".
Accountability to Parliament is "crucially important for the Commission's democratic legitimacy", stressed Commission President José Manuel Barroso . The present exceptional times, with the economic crisis, climate change and energy security issues, meant that now was "a time for boldness". We need "strong European institutions" to tackle these challenges, he argued, and it was up to the Commission and Parliament acting together "to ensure that the EU is more than the sum of its parts".
The French leader of the centre right European People's Party (EPP) group Joseph Daul stressed that the EU must project "what the EU is - a world leader on the measures of GDP, market size and contributions to international aid", he added. Yet from Haiti to Iran, Afghanistan to Yemen, Cuba to transatlantic relations, the EU's voice so far has "failed to match our aspirations", he said, urging an "ambitious programme" to remedy this. The Commission's political orientation must reflect the outcome of the 2009 elections, he concluded.
Martin Schulz of the Socialist and Democrats complained that the Commissioners-designate had taken a "vow of silence" during the hearings, imposed by President Barroso, in order not to say anything wrong. Those who entered into a real dialogue with the Parliament, such as Michel Barnier, Joaquin Almunia and Kristalina Georgieva, had "gained standing". The Commission needs to work as a college and must not be run like a "presidential system", said the German leader.
Guy Verhofstadt of the Liberal ALDE said his bloc "is a responsible group" and would vote in favour, although "our support will be conditional". He expected the new Commission to "become a driving force for Europe, which has not been the case for the last five years" and that they work as a real college, with a strong sense of unity and the ability to find polices backed by the three different political families that compose the college, among them the liberals. Finally, the new Commission needs to "focus on one main task: to find an answer to the economic crisis and a workable strategy to Europe 2020. Don't listen too much to Member States", he concluded.
Daniel Cohn-Bendit , of the Greens/EFA group , believed he was in the presence of "a coalition of hypocrites", as many MEPs would vote for a Commission they did not really support. Most of the Commissioners-designate had not displayed enough "vision and ambition" in their hearings but MEPs would still back them, thus implying that "all the minuses produce a plus". Cohn-Bendit said his group would not vote in favour of the Commission but added "don't say those who don't vote for you are against Europe". He promised the Commission his group's support on various issues if it took the right action, for example on climate change or the regulation of financial markets.
On behalf of his group, Czech Jan Zahradil (ECR) said to Mr Barroso "In 2005, you came up with the idea of cutting red tape by simplifying legislation. Why not revive this idea now?". He added "If you demonstrate that you're a reformer, we shall back you, but if you follow well-trodden paths, we shall stand up and resist you".
Lothar Bisky (GUE/NGL) criticised the neoliberal stance of the Commission President. The new college of Commissioners would also reflect this. "You will not get the approval of my group and you can expect harsh, but fair, exchanges of views with your college".
For the EFD group, Nigel Farage (UK) told Mr Barroso "what we have before us here is the new government of Europe, a government that with the Lisbon Treaty now has enormous powers" including "the ability now to use emergency powers to literally take countries over, and yet what we have heard from the European Parliament’s big group leaders this morning is the demand that you take even more powers!" He argued that "poor Greece" is "trapped inside the economic prison of the euro" and "the same is going to happen to Spain, to Portugal and to Ireland".
Background
The election vote was preceded by hearings of the Commissioners-designate organised by the committees of Parliament in January and February. Each committee sent an evaluation letter on the respective Commissioner-designate to the Conference of Presidents (a body consisting of the EP President and the political group leaders). All these evaluations were positive, and on 4 February the Conference of Presidents gave the go-ahead for the vote to take place.

EU membership candidates: keep on reforming to stay on track
MEPs voted on reports on Croatia, FYROM & Turkey. They were joined in the debate by Enlargement Commissioner Štefan Füle (top right), and Council representative Diego López Garrido. Wednesday 10 February Parliament has given a positive overall verdict on last year's efforts by Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to qualify for EU membership. In resolutions debated and approved on Wednesday, MEPs also underlined the limited progress made by Turkey towards meeting the "Copenhagen" EU eligibility criteria for EU membership.
Issues such as the rule of law, freedom of expression, good neighbourly relations, treatment of ethnic minorities, women's rights and the fight against corruption and organised crime must still be addressed by Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey, according to today's resolutions.
Croatia
Accession negotiations with Croatia could be wound up in 2010 and Croatia's successful accession would give a "positive impetus" to the process of integrating the rest of the Western Balkans region within Europe, says the resolution drafted by Austrian Socialist Hannes Swoboda and adopted by 582 votes to 24, with 37 abstentions. MEPs are nonetheless concerned that public support for membership is diminishing in Croatia.
Croatia is expected to "co-operate fully" with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and allow the Court access to documents requested for use in war crimes trials, says Parliament.
Arrangements for solving the bilateral border dispute with Slovenia "have created the momentum to open all remaining chapters", says the resolution. The Council should decide "as soon as possible" to open the "Judiciary and Fundamental Rights" chapter of the negotiations. Of the 35 chapters, 28 have been started and 17 have been provisionally completed.
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
With negotiations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia expected by MEPs "to begin in the near future", Parliament asks the Council to confirm, at its March 2010 summit, that it accepts the Commission's recommendation that negotiations be opened. They back the Greek government's suggestion of a "symbolic and motivational target date of 2014" for the EU accession of Western Balkan countries, in a resolution drafted by Slovenian Socialist Zoran Thaler and adopted by 548 votes to 45, with 35 abstentions.
On the issue of the country's name, Parliament asks the governments of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and of Greece to "redouble their efforts at the highest level to find a mutually satisfactory solution to the name issue". According to MEPs, the EU should be ready to assist in the negotiation process.
Turkey
Progress on concrete reforms remained limited in 2009, says the resolution on Turkey drafted by Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP, NL) and adopted by show of hands.
Parliament recalls that the opening of negotiations in 2005 was the starting point for "a long-lasting and open-ended process". MEPs deplore the non-implementation of the Additional Protocol to the EC-Turkey Association Agreement for the "fourth consecutive year". "Failure to do so may further seriously affect the process of negotiations", they warn.
MEPs regret the Constitutional Court's decisions to close the Democratic Society Party (DTP), and to annul the legislation limiting the jurisdiction of military courts. They say these are "a serious setback in Turkey's reform efforts" and therefore call for the Constitution to be reformed.
The Turkish Government should contribute "in concrete terms" to the comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue, say MEPs. By immediately starting the withdrawal of its forces from the northern part of the island and addressing the issue of settlements of Turkish citizens, Turkey would help "facilitate a suitable climate for negotiations".
As positive news from Ankara, MEPs cite the broad public debate on issues within the so-called democratic opening, and a law removing restrictions on broadcasting in Kurdish. They also appreciate the diplomatic efforts made to normalise relations with Armenia but ask that the relevant protocols be ratified. In addition, they acknowledge Turkey's role in regional security (Black Sea and Middle-East).
MEPs welcome the Signing of the Nabucco Pipeline agreement and call for the opening of the energy chapter in the accession negotiations. Twelve out of the 35 chapters have so far been opened. The environment chapter was opened in December 2009.
Male-female equality: tackle violence and guarantee paternity leave, say MEPs
Women are still not earning as much as men on average In its annual report on equality between men and women in the EU, Parliament called on Wednesday for greater efforts to tackle violence against women, for paternity leave to be addressed at EU level and for equal pay legislation to be revised. A majority of MEPs also say women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, through easy access to contraception and abortion.
The report, drafted by Belgian Socialist Marc Tarabella, was adopted by 381 votes to 253, with 31 abstentions.
Eradicating violence against women
MEPs call on the Commission to draft a comprehensive directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women. They call for a European Year of Combating Violence against Women, pointing out that almost one in four women in the EU suffer physical violence and more than 10% sexual violence. MEPs also endorse the Spanish Presidency's proposals to introduce an EU-wide "European protection order for victims" and a common EU-wide telephone helpline for victims .
Sexual and reproductive rights
Parliament believes recognition of the full physical and sexual autonomy of women is a first step for any policies designed to combat violence against women. Women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, notably through easy access to contraception and abortion (this point was adopted by 412 votes to 212, with 36 abstentions) and abortion consultations must be free of charge. A majority of MEPs thus backed measures to improve women’s access to sexual and reproductive health services.
Fighting human trafficking
So far, only 16 EU Member States have ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, which is the strongest European legal instrument in the fight against trafficking in human beings, a modern form of slavery. MEPs call on the Member States that have not yet done so (i. e. the Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Hungary, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden) to ratify this Convention.
Establishing paternity leave entitlement
The EU has a directive on maternity leave and a directive on parental leave, but no legislation on paternity leave. The House therefore calls on the Commission "to support any moves to establish paternity-leave entitlement on a Europe-wide basis" and says that maternity and paternity leave should be linked so as to afford better protection to women in the labour market. MEPs regret that the Social Partners' Framework Agreement on Parental Leave from July 2009 fails to address the issue of paid leave as a way of achieving male-female equality.
Equal pay
Parliament deplores the fact that the Commission has not responded to the EP's request that it present draft legislation revising the existing law on application of the principle of equal pay and that it present such a proposal without delay.
Gender balance in high-level positions
A better gender balance in corporate, administrative and political positions of responsibility in the Member States should be encouraged, say MEPs, pointing to the Norwegian Government's decision to increase the rate of female members on the boards of private and public companies to at least 40%.
As to the composition of the Commission, a majority of MEPs call on Member States, in future nominations, to put forward two candidates, one of each gender, so as to facilitate the composition of a more representative Commission.
Migrant women
Migrant women, especially Romani women, regularly experience multiple forms of discrimination and national equality bodies should address this matter, says the report. MEPs also ask the Member States "to provide social security cover for female workers in domestic and other sectors where it is not available, with a view to promoting the integration of migrants".

Better housing for poor communities
Funds to renovate poor housing stock will now be available in Western Europe. ©Belga/AFP/I Huszti Poor communities in all Member States could get EU regional funding for renovation or replacement of their housing, under a regulation approved by the European Parliament on Wednesday.
There are very limited cases in which the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) can be used to finance housing measures. Until recently only urban housing improvements in the 12 countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 were eligible for ERDF money. However, last year the EU amended the ERDF regulation to allow financing energy-efficiency measures in housing in all EU Member States.
The approval of the current amended regulation, the text of which has already been agreed between Parliament and Council, will entitle all 27 Member States to use the ERDF funds, in addition to other sources, to renovate the existing houses of their "marginalised communities" or to replace them with new ones, irrespective of whether these are in urban or rural areas.
The amended regulation aims at improving the situation of all marginalised communities, among them the Roma, which is currently the largest poverty-affected social group in Europe.
Parliament's report, drafted by Dutch MEP Lambert van Nistelrooij (EPP), was adopted by 588 votes to 57, with 16 abstentions.

MEPs call for swifter response and tighter coordination in the Eurozone
The Eurozone is under threat as never before ©Belga/H Hattendorf MEPs generally urged the Commission and the Council to use the current difficulties in the eurozone to take firm action in favour of more binding economic coordination as well as to respond more quickly in the future so as to avoid tension on the financial markets.
Addressing the plenary on the difficult monetary, economic and social situation of eurozone countries, the Council presidency representative Diego López Garrido said "the situation of the public deficit is a clear result of the crisis coupled with strong financial intervention by governments to prevent the collapse of the financial system". On the monetary situation, he said that "despite tension on the stock market, the EU has acted adequately" and "incentives in place should not yet be abandoned".
Fiscal measures, structural reforms and an integrated surveillance mechanism are "the keys to find a solution to present tensions" and to "put Greece back on a sustainable path", said Commissioner Joaquin Almunia , who spelled out the Commission's plans as well as those of Greece. He expressed the Commission's support for the plan proposed by the Greek government and added: "However, there are risks to the programme targets and medium term fiscal adjustments. The macro-economic scenario is rather optimistic (...) such as the estimated efforts to tackle tax evasion during an economic down-turn." Mr Almunia also said that Eurostat must be given more power to audit Member States' statistics. Concluding the debate, he said that support from Member States would not come for free and Greece must make the necessary efforts in return.
Speaking on behalf of the EPP, Corien Wortmann-Kool (NL) said that her group was fully behind the Commission's approach to dealing with Greece's problems, although this action was coming months later than it should have. The problems the eurozone was currently facing made a more rigorous approach to economic governance urgent and stronger coordination of economic policies necessary.
The 2020 objective, as set out by President Barroso, is a "thin soup", which urgently needs to be thickened with more economic policy co-ordination, said Udo Bullman (DE) for the S&D group. "Don't give way to fear", he urged Member States. Mr Bullman also noted that "Member States are failing in their modernisation efforts" but expressed confidence that the Greek finance minister would "do a good job". Finally, the EU "must be able to defend itself against market attacks" by using unconventional tools.
"Our tactical and strategic error was that we didn't intervene immediately and that we followed the wrong approach from the start", Guy Verhofstadt (ALDE, BE) said, adding that the situation in Greece showed the failure of the Lisbon strategy. He criticised the "lack of cohesion, the lack of confidence and the lack of solidarity" and stressed that Europe didn't need the IMF to intervene to solve the eurozone's problems.
Pascal Canfin (Greens/EFA, FR) warned that until quite recently Spain was complying fully with the stability criteria but its private debt "was allowed to explode" and two years on the situation was very poor with a high rate of unemployment: "The stability criteria are important but not enough". "If one has a narrow vision of the Stability and Growth Pact criteria, we risk missing the bigger picture, which will prevent us from seeing the next crisis coming".
Kay Swinburne (ECR, UK) said that sovereign debt spreads led to speculation on the market, leaving the EU "exposed in times of crisis". She suggested that, in the eurozone, the ECB should have an oversight of cumulative debt issuance. The EU should also set up a sustainable debt maturity strategy, she said.
Referring to plans for emerging from the crisis, Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL, EL) said we need to review our current models and not attempt to use them again. "The Lisbon strategy is one of the causes of the crisis we are in, never mind it protecting us" he said. Concluding Mr Chountis stressed that this was a eurozone crisis and not a Greek one.
"We have a disaster in the making in Greece and Europe" said Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD, EL), contrasting President Barroso's vision of stronger economic, social and employment bonds among Member States with the reality of capital-driven markets from which profits are exported without hesitation, giving rise to speculation.
SWIFT Debate: MEPs still concerned about data protection in interim agreement
Dutch MEP Jeanine Hennis Plasschaert, rapporteur of the SWIFT report In a debate on Wednesday most of Parliament's political groups restated their concern at the lack of data protection and legal redress in the provisional agreement on bank data transfers to the United-States via the SWIFT network. "The Council has made some encouraging signs but it didn't go beyond that", said the EPP speaker. The S&D, ALDE, Greens and GUE groups spoke out firmly against the agreement, while the ECR said it needed more time for reflexion.
The EP vote of consent, which is required for the provisional agreement to be legally effective, will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at noon.
Parliament's rapporteur, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (ALDE, NL), said that the use of bank data was necessary to fight terrorism but that "the Council has not been tough enough" on the issue of data protection. She was disappointed that the EU "continues to outsource its security services to the United States without any reciprocity". She also argued that the rules on data transfer and storage provided for in the interim agreement were not proportionate.
Council president-in-office Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba said the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) was "a tool of great value which has made it possible to prevent terrorist attacks". He believed the accord provided sufficient guarantees on data protection and urged Parliament and the Council to work on an interinstitutional agreement to allow MEPs easier access to classified documents.
At the end of the debate, Mr Pérez Rubalcaba said he did not have the power to put forward a new draft agreement at short notice but he hoped to come back before MEPs "in a few months" to present the results of talks with the US administration. "That's why I'm asking you for time", he said.
According to Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmström , the SWIFT agreement "is not favourable to the United States alone but benefits everyone". She said the report produced by former anti-terrorist judge Jean-Louis Bruguière for the Commission "confirms that the TFTP is important in providing useful information in the fight against terrorism". She believed a rejection of the agreement by Parliament would represent "a serious threat to the security" of Europe's citizens.
"We want to ensure safety and security, as well as civil liberties and data protection on an equal footing", Ernst Strasser (EPP, AT) told the House. The EU had a "good partnership with the US" but "the way this text came about was not reasonable for us", he argued. "We can't accept this state of affairs", declared Mr Strasser. "The Council has made some encouraging signs but that's it, it didn't go beyond that" he added.
Signing this agreement "was a mistake by EU governments" (...) they thought they could get away with such a poor agreement, which is not in line with fundamental rights", said Martin Schulz (S&D, DE). "How will data be retained, how will it be stored, can I have access to it, when it is going to be deleted?", asked Mr Schulz, wondering whether it could be kept for up to 90 years. "This is a bad agreement that we simply cannot sign up to", he declared.
SWIFT is a "key decision for the EP to take", and it should be free from claims of an alleged "security gap", said Sophia In't Veld (ALDE, NL). Parliament could grant its consent only to an agreement's "substance and procedures", but "the Council's answers are inadequate", she observed, adding that "our voters have the right to know that we take data protection very seriously and don't simply rubber-stamp Council decisions".
"We have to vote down the interim agreement, not defer it", said Rebeca Harms (DE) for the Greens/EFA group. "We should not be agreeing to an agreement when many of us have stated again and again that this is an infringing piece of law", she urged, adding that it was "disgraceful" that the Council had failed to engage in constructive dialogue, even though US colleagues were ready to do so.
Timothy Kirkhope (ECR, UK) said he was "frustrated and angered" by the Council's treatment of Parliament. "Parliament's right to consent should not be used as a retrospective tool", he said. "We are finally getting assurances from Council and Commission" on data protection issues, "but we now need some time before proceeding further in our considerations", he added.
The interim agreement had been "reached via a dubious process" and sought "to get around the European Parliament", said Lothar Bisky (GUE/NGL, DE).
SWIFT VOTE : European Parliament votes down agreement with the US
Colleagues of rapporteur Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert congratulate her on the SWIFT vote as Parliament follows her recommendation © Belga EPA/CUGNOT MATHIEU Parliament refused on Thursday to give its consent to the EU's interim agreement on banking data transfers to the USA via the SWIFT network, amid concerns for privacy, proportionality and reciprocity. This move renders the text signed between the US and the 27 EU Member states legally void. MEPs propose to negotiate a new agreement.
The resolution rejecting the agreement was approved by 378 votes to 196, with 31 abstentions. It also asks the Commission and the Council to initiate work on a long-term agreement with the USA on this issue. MEPs reiterate that any new agreement must comply with Lisbon Treaty requirements, and in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
A proposal by the EPP and ECR groups to postpone the vote was rejected by 290 votes to 305, with 14 abstentions.
"Council has not been tough enough on data protection" said rapporteur Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (ALDE, NL), who argued that the rules on data transfer and storage provided for in the interim agreement were not proportionate to the security supposedly provided.
In order to continue sharing financial data in the purpose of fighting terrorism, the EU and the United States still rely on a Mutual Legal Assistance agreement allowing for exchange of data within the framework of EU member states national law.
The European Commission announced yesterday, in a letter to EP president Jerzy Buzek, that it is to adopt draft negotiation guidelines for a long term agreement "in the coming weeks". The guidelines "will address the European Parliament and Council's concerns" and ensure "the utmost respect for privacy and data protection".
MEPs reaffirmed the principles set out earlier in a resolution approved on 17 September 2009.
Data on EU citizens to be subject to EU rules
In the September 2009 resolution, MEPs demanded that the accord should fully respect the rights of EU citizens with regard to personal data protection. The data, they said, should be gathered "only for the purposes of fighting terrorism" and "the right balance" must be struck between security measures and the protection of civil liberties.
The resolution calls for "the same judicial redress mechanisms as would apply to data held within the EU, including compensation in the event of unlawful processing of personal data".
Background
In July 2009, the press revealed that a new agreement was to be negotiated following changes in the structure of SWIFT. The company had set up a storage centre for its European data in Switzerland, which meant that intra-European data was stored only in Europe. Until then the data had also been kept on a server in the United States. This new architecture required the negotiation of a fresh agreement between the Commission and Council on the one hand and the United States on the other.
Preventing needle-stick injuries in the health sector
Parliament has been calling since July 2006 for legislation to protect Europe's healthcare workers An agreement to prevent needle-stick injuries in hospitals, one of the most widespread and serious risks to health workers across the EU, was welcomed by an overwhelming majority in Parliament on Thursday. The deal was drawn up by EU representatives of hospital employers and workers.
Needle-stick injuries in hospitals can result in the transmission of more than 20 life-threatening viruses, including Hepatitis B, C and HIV. In the EU, there are more than one million needle-stick injuries every year, says a resolution drafted by Elisabeth Lynne (ALDE, UK) and Pervenche Bérès (S&D, FR) on behalf of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee. A resolution welcoming the agreement was approved by a show of hands.
Parliament has been calling since July 2006 for legislation to protect Europe's healthcare workers from potentially dangerous infections due to injuries with needles and other sharp medical instruments.
The Commission issued a proposal for a Council Directive implementing the agreement signed by the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers' Association (HOSPEEM) and the European Federation of Public Services Union (EPSU).
MEPs recommend adopting and implementing the measures set out in the legislative proposal. "The framework agreement between the Commission and European social partners will represent an important contribution to the protection of health and safety of workers active in the hospital sector", says the resolution. "However, Member States and social partners should be free to adopt additional measures which are more favourable to workers", it adds.

EU position on blue fin tuna ban debated Tuesday
MEPs will debate whether to ban the trade in blue fin tuna this week ©Belga The fate of blue fin tuna hangs in the balance this week as a complete ban on the trade is debated by MEPs. Ahead of a meeting of the Convention for the Protection of Endangered Species (CITES) the European Union must thrash out a position on whether to support a ban proposed by Monaco. The Union is divided although recently two key states, France and Italy, have swung around behind stopping the trade. The debate on Tuesday will be crucial to establishing a consensus.
Blue fin tuna has been fished for millennia although scientific data has shown that between 1997-2007 stocks in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean declined by 60%.
About three quarters of all Atlantic Tuna ends up on the plates of Japanese restaurants and homes as sushi and sashimi. Blue fin tuna is the most popular and endanged species of tuna.
The role of the UN body CITES is to regulate trade in animal and plants that are endangered. The fate of polar bears, African elephants and tigers will also be discussed when its 175 members meet in Doha in March. The European Commission, which runs EU fisheries policy, has already recommended adding blue fin tuna to the CITES list.
"All or nothing decision"
The Chair of Parliament's Environment Committee, German Socialist Jo Leinen told us that "blue fin tuna is seriously under threat of extinction. The EU needs to act quickly and stand up for a temporary trade ban at the CITES conference in Qatar".
Speaking ahead of the debate Saskia Richartz of Greenpeace commented: "This is an all or nothing decision: either we save the blue fin now or we almost certainly condemn the species to extinction”.
However, Mourad Kahoul of the Euro-Mediterranean Professional Fishers of Tuna Association said: "The biological criteria of CITES necessary to integrate blue fin tuna into the list of endangered species have not been met. Including blue fin tuna on the list of endangered species would be an irresponsible act by European policy makers".
Small scale fishing still possible with ban
If the trade is listed by CITES as being prohibited then only small-scale tuna fisheries would be allowed - such as tuna traps, with the produce still being sold.

A look back at what happened in Parliament this week
The session opens in Strasbourg Parliament's Speaker Jerzy Buzek makes his point Commission President Barroso spells out what will be his policies, Tuesday 9 February. Joseph Daul (left), leader of Parliament's largest bloc, the centre right EPP, congratulates Mr Barroso The 26 new European Commissioners in the main staircase in Strasbourg The June 2009 elections and new powers are Ushering in a new Parliamentary era Dutch Liberal Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert acted as Parliament's rapporteur on SWIFT Members voting - electronically and by hand A moment of reflection in Parliament's Strasbourg building Large screens in the Chamber display the results of votes Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert greets supporters after the landmark vote MEPs' rejection of the SWIFT EU-US data sharing agreement brought the parliamentary week to a dramatic close as the EP defied European governments. Also this week Members voted in a new executive for the EU, discussed further expansion of the Union, the eurozone, Iran and body scanners at airports. Blue fin tuna got a new lease of life as MEPs strongly supported putting them on a UN list of species in which trade is prohibited. The photo slideshow conveys some of the images of the week.
Habemus European Commission : as the Commission proposes EU legislation on everything from transport to trade its membership will always be a source of political debate. Prior to Tuesday's vote, many MEPs were in lively form as they traded views on each other and the Barroso II Commission. Despite the charged atmosphere, the 488-137 votes in favour told its own story.
SWIFT shot down: a transatlantic row could be brewing after MEPs voted to strike down an agreement by EU governments to allow the US Administration access to financial data from the SWIFT data clearing house (80% of global transactions) in the fight against terrorist financiering.
Croatia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey all had their progress towards EU membership reviewed this week. Zagreb scored the highest marks with Skopje close behind and Ankara with work still to do.
Iran's playing for time over its nuclear programme was criticised sharply by MEPs . Members deplored the Iranian government's latest rejection of a compromise over the nuclear issue. Parliament said that Tehran "was apparently seeking to use this issue both as a means of distracting attention from the crisis within the country and as tactics to win time".
MEPs voted on a measure to ensure housing for the poor in Western Europe will now qualify for EU renovation funds - previously this fund had only been for Central and Eastern Europe.
Many positions were exposed on the debate on body scanners Wednesday. MEPs are still divided on whether they really represent another way to fight terrorism or constitute an over-reaction.
Fathers could be welcoming MEPs' decision to back calls for greater paternity leave. It was part of a series of measures including equal pay and action against domestic violence that formed part of the annual equal pay debate.
With the euro facing its greatest challenge , MEPs called for the European Union to show solidarity towards members that were struggling.
If you are a blue fin tuna connoisseur you may be disappointed that MEPs threw their weight behind getting it made an endangered species by the UN. Stocks have been decimated, but it can still be caught in small amounts so we can still enjoy it.
In other news, the House called for international help for Yemen in its fight against terrorism as well as solidarity with Haiti. The results of the election in Ukraine were also discussed.
