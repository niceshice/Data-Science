In adopting an own initiative report on financial support to Palestine, the House says that even if the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership has not as yet produced the expected benefits and has not contributed to the lowering of tensions in the area to its full potential, improvements can still be made and thus the Barcelona Process continues to be the appropriate framework for Mediterranean policy, in which changes and the necessary political will are needed to obtain better results.
The House recalls its resolution of 1 June 2006 on the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories and the role of the EU in which it called on the Commission and the Council to develop a temporary international mechanism (TIM) in order to avoid a major humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories. MEPs recall having welcomed, following the recommendations of the European Council and the Quartet in June 2006, the setting-up by the EU of the TIM for the Palestinian Authority and its subsequent renewal.
The House notes that this financial stopgap measure made it possible, in a transparent manner and in partnership with the President of the Palestinian Authority, to limit the most egregious humanitarian suffering caused by the freezing of European and international financial aid, Israelâ€™s partial payment of Palestinian customs revenues and the general impossibility of developing a viable economy in the current occupation situation.
MEPs underline that payments under TIM did not go to, or through, the Office of the President of the Palestinian Authority or the Ministry of Finance, but provided for direct payment of invoices, or cash payment to the individual beneficiaries of allocations. Parliament notes that allocations did not cover security staff or political level.
Finally, the EP regrets however, that this financial assistance did not compensate the tragic situation in Palestine and that the conditions for all economic, social and human aspects have worsened in the past months.
Council decision to resume aid to Palestine
On 18 June, the Council decided that the EU will resume normal relations with the Palestinian Authority immediately. With this objective, the EU will develop the conditions for urgent practical and financial assistance including direct financial support to the government; support to the Palestinian Civilian Police through the resumption of the EUPOL COPPS mission; the resumption of the activities of the EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) Rafah; and intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future Palestinian state. MEPs welcome the Council decision of 18 June asking the EU to resume normal relations with the Palestinian Authority immediately and to this objective to develop the conditions for urgent practical and financial assistance including direct financial support to the new government as well as to ensure the provision of emergency and humanitarian assistance to the population of Gaza (via especially TIM)
