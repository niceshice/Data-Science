Dates of plenary sessions for 2009
Monday 19 May 2008
The session starts with a legislative report on the p rotection of the environment through criminal law . Seriously damaging the environment should be made a criminal offence in all EU Member States, so as to ensure that EU legislation is properly enforced, says the Legal Affairs Committee.
The second report on Monday's agenda deals the 2009 budget - Parliament's estimates . MEPs in the Committee on Budgets endorse the draft estimates and agree with the principle of establishing a "Lisbon reserve".
Bairbre de Brún (GUE/NGL, UK, Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin) presents a report on the evaluation of the Peace Programme (in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) and strategies for the future. The experience gained from the PEACE programmes in Ireland, positive results and best practice, what may be improved, challenges still to be faced and lessons to be learned are set out in an own-initiative report. Lessons from these programmes could help elsewhere, within and beyond EU borders. The possibility of creating a Europe-wide network of regions and cities living with, or emerging from, conflict and exclusion is now under discussion, notes the report.
MEPs will debate a report on the EU consumer strategy (2007-2013) which says that since the greatest obstacles to the development of an internal market in retailing include uncertainties regarding consumer contracts, supports the Commission in its efforts to introduce standard contracts and conditions for contracts concluded on-line which would have the same force in all the Member States.
Tuesday 20 May 2008
Tuesday starts with a debate on the guidelines for employment policies . Tax-benefit structures should not discriminate against women, and workers should be encouraged to prolong their working lives, says the Employment Committee's report on the EU's guidelines for employment policies that will be debated by MEPs. The report also mentions of the targets to be reached by 2010, such as an average rate of early school leavers of no more than 10% or a raise in the effective retirement age by five years.
Liz Lynne (ALDE, UK, Liberal Democrat, West Midlands) will outline her report on the progress made in equal-opportunities and non-discrimination in the EU . The report calls for a "comprehensive directive" to combat any discrimination on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. It also demands effective sanctions and support for victims.
20 May will be designated European Maritime Day with a key event in Strasbourg. The President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering , Council President Janez Janša , and Commission President José Manuel Barroso will officially launch the first European Maritime Day by signing the Joint Tripartite Declaration establishing a "European Maritime Day". A photo opportunity/press point will be organised at the EP.
MEPs will vote on the dates of the Strasbourg and Brussels plenary sessions for 2009 . 2009 is European election year with elections taking place the first week of June 2009 in the 27 Member States.
On Tuesday afternoon, Arlene McCarthy (North West Labour, PES, UK) for the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee will be asking questions of the Council on misleading 'Directory companies' (e.g. 'European City Guides') Over the past years, a number of so-called 'Directory companies' (for instance 'European City Guides') have been operating cross-border in several EU Member States applying misleading and fraudulent business practices.
Parliament is to debate and vote on three legislative reports on proposals aimed at modernising the rules governing admission to the occupation of transport operator and access to the road transport market . The Commission proposals provide for compulsory training for transport managers, an enforceable definition of cabotage which can be carried out within a Member State and mechanisms for imposing sanctions across the national borders. MEPs are negotiating a first-reading deal with the Council.
Fiona Hall (ALDE, UK, Liberal Democrat North East) will present her legislative report on the selection and authorisation of systems providing mobile satellite services . Draft rules providing for systems providing mobile satellite services - such as broadband internet or mobile TV - to be selected at EU level in the future are backed by the Industry Committee. Parliament will vote on a first-reading compromise package, negotiated with Council, which lays down that each system has to provide services in at least 60% of the EU's total area when it starts operating and should cover at least half of each Member States' population after seven years at the latest.
Tuesday evening sees MEPs debating a second-reading agreement on metallic mercury (exports and storage) . The export of mercury and mercury compounds from the EU shall be prohibited from 15 March 2011, according to a second reading compromise which is being proposed by the Environment Committee and negotiated between representatives of the EP and the Council.
The House will also debate a report on a better ship dismantling . Acting on environmentally damaging practices and on dangerous working conditions under which cargo ships are dismantled, primarily in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, is the key point of the report. MEPs in the committee also ask the Commission to set up a list to register and monitor 'pre-waste ships', and a list of preferred ship recycling facilities in an own-initiative report.
Wednesday 21 May 2008
The key topic of the week is a report on the scientific facts of climate change: findings and recommendations for decision making . Climate Change Committee MEPs criticise “scientifically unsubstantiated efforts” to discredit studies on the causes and effects of climate change, call for additional research on the impact of biofuels, and warn that current policies will not suffice to stem global warming in the long term, in an interim report.
The House will then debate a report on Turkey's 2007 progress . "Transform priorities and time-lines into reform plans," the Foreign Affairs Committee urged Turkey, in its latest progress report. The committee welcomes several recent legislative activities of Turkey, while insisting that the speed of reforms must pick up. The report "welcomes the commitment of Prime Minister Erdogan that 2008 is going to be the year of reforms" and "urges the Turkish government to fulfil its promises" by implementing them.
Parliament will then debate the recent tragic cyclone Myanmar and devastating earthquake in central China . MEPs will vote on two separate resolutions on these topics .
The House will debate a new animal health strategy for the EU (2007-2013) MEPs in the Agriculture Committee support the objectives of the Commission's Animal Health Strategy for the EU, but call for more ambition and stress that such objectives can only be achieved with a sufficient and clearly defined budget. They also strongly support vaccination, which according to them should be recognised as one of the more important methods to prevent diseases.
Thursday 22 May 2008
MEPs will debate the follow up of the Paris declaration of 2005 on aid effectiveness . Simplifying aid procedures and phasing out economic policy conditionality are among the demands of the EP Committee on Development in a report on aid effectiveness to developing countries. To be more efficient, aid should also be disbursed according to partners´ own priorities and timetables, says the report. The report also underlines the necessary fight against corruption.
Parliament votes on a resolution on rising food prices in the EU and developing countries following the debate that was held on 22 April In Strasbourg.
The House will also vote on a resolution on negotiations between the EU and the United States with regards to visa exemptions following the debate that was held on 23 April in Strasbourg.
The European Parliament will vote on a resolution on the situation in Lebanon given the latest political clashes .
As usual the session ends with three debates and votes on human rights issues in the world. On this occasion the topics are: Sudan and the International Criminal Court, detention of political opponents in Belarus and increasing tensions in Burundi.

Current mitigation efforts "insufficient" says Climate Change Committee
2008-05-15 - 09:44
Climate Change Committee MEPs criticise “scientifically unsubstantiated efforts” to discredit studies on the causes and effects of climate change, call for additional research on the impact of biofuels, and warn that current policies will not suffice to stem global warming in the long term, in an interim report on “the scientific facts of climate change”. Current research shows “the risk of serious impact on our planet if measures are not taken swiftly” to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, says the report.
MEPs in the committee warn that existing climate change mitigation policies and related sustainable development practices will be “insufficient to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions over the next decades”. They note that most EU Member States are making “good or even excellent progress” in their efforts to comply with their burden-sharing targets, thus “raising the likelihood that the EU will reach its Kyoto target by 2012”, but warn that they will have to reduce emissions “in a more ambitious way” to meet long-term EU targets.
Global warming "predominantly man-made"
MEPs in the committee acknowledge that scientific progress “has always been marked by uncertainties,” but condemn “scientifically unsubstantiated efforts to portray the results of studies into the causes and effects of climate change as doubtful, uncertain or questionable”. The underlying causes of global warming “are predominantly man-made”, they say.
More research needed on biofuels’ environmental impact
The text also calls for “additional research into the impact of the policy of promoting biofuels and their effects on the increase of deforestation, the expansion of cultivated land and world food supplies”.
Next steps
The interim report, drafted by Karl-Heinz FLORENZ (EPP-ED, DE) addresses only the scientific facts of climate change. Recommendations for the EU's future integrated climate change policy, for adaptation and mitigation measures, and for Parliament’s position in international negotiations for a post-2012 climate change framework, will be set out in a final report, to be adopted by the end of the committee’s term of office.
The committee’s term of office – in accordance with an earlier (18 February) decision of the plenary – has been extended until February 2009.
On the committee’s behalf, chairman Guido SACCONI (PES, IT) recently asked that the Parliament consider setting up a scheme for offsetting its carbon emissions, particularly those arising from EP delegation visits.

Export-ban of mercury and mercury compounds from the EU by 2011
2008-05-15 - 09:44
The export of mercury and mercury compounds from the EU shall be prohibited from 15 March 2011, according to a second reading compromise which is being proposed by the Environment Committee and negotiated between representatives of the EP and the Council. The Compromise says the ban on exports of mercury should start on 15 March 2011 - three months earlier than proposed by the Council; the Commission had proposed 1 October 2011. As demanded by members of the Environment Committee in the second-reading report drafted by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL, EL), in addition to metallic mercury, the export ban will also cover other mercury compounds as for example cinnabar ore, mercury chloride and mercury oxide. Compounds for research and development, medical or analytical analysis purposes are not covered by the prohibition.
Commenting on the compromise, Parliament's rapporteur, Dimitrios Papadimoulis said: "I am glad we managed to extend the export ban of metallic mercury to its more toxic and dangerous compounds and examine, by January 2010, the need to extend it even more, by including other mercury compounds and products containing mercury, in an effort to close all loopholes. We also brought forward the legislation and ensured the safe storage of mercury, by predominantly environmental and health criteria. This is the best compromise we could have realistically hoped to obtain, with some Member States ferociously opposing it. It is a source of great relief to everyone fighting to exclude mercury from our daily lives and avoiding making the developing world Europe's dumping ground."
Safe storage of mercury stocks
MEPs in the committee agree with the Council that mercury waste should be stored either in salt mines, in deep, underground, hard rock formations, or in above-ground facilities "in a way that is safe for human health and the environment" before eventually being disposed of.
The Commission shall keep under review ongoing research activities on safe disposal options, including solidification of metallic mercury and submit by 1 January 2010 a report to Parliament and Council and, if appropriate, a proposal for revision of the directive not later than 15 March 2013.
Ban of mercury imports to be examined by Commission by 2010
The Parliament's first reading request, supported also by the Environment committee, to also ban mercury imports into the EU is not included in the compromise. The compromise foresees that the Commission will, together with the Member States and the relevant stakeholders, examine by 2010 if there is a need for such a ban. Furthermore, the Commission will examine if the export ban shall be extended to other mercury compounds, mixtures with a lower mercury content and products containing mercury, in particular thermometers, barometers and sphygmomanometers.
Uses and hazards of mercury
Mercury can come from waste recycling (e.g. fluorescent lamps, batteries), natural gas cleaning or the industrial treatment of non-ferrous metals. It is used above all in the chlor-alkali industry, which has undertaken to convert to techniques that are less dangerous to health and the environment; the old methods produce large quantities of highly toxic calomel (mercurous chloride).
Mercury is highly toxic to humans, especially when transformed into methylmercury. It is also bio-accumulative, meaning that it concentrates in the food chain. Numerous scientific studies blame it for cardiovascular and immune-system ailments. It can affect the brain development of unborn children, even in minimal doses.
Mercury use is declining both in the EU and globally. Global demand is around 3,400 tonnes per year, with the EU-25 accounting for 780 tonnes in 2005.
Across the world, the main uses of mercury are in small-scale gold mining, the chlor-alkali industry and production of vinyl-chloride monomer, the basis of PVC plastic. In the EU only the chlor-alkali industry remains a significant user, and it is progressively phasing out the use of mercury-containing cells in its production of chlorine.
Absolute majority needed at second reading
When the full Parliament votes on this issue in May, it will need an absolute majority of its Members (i.e. 393 votes in favour) for each of the compromise amendments to the Council's Common Position.

Better social and environmental conditions needed when EU vessels are scrapped on Asia's shores
2008-05-15 - 09:44
Acting on environmentally damaging practices and on dangerous working conditions under which cargo ships are dismantled, primarily in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, is the key point of the report. MEPs in the committee also ask the Commission to set up a list to register and monitor 'pre-waste ships', and a list of preferred ship recycling facilities in an own-initiative report drafted by Hans BLOKLAND (IND/DEM, NL). Up to 600 large cargo ships of over 2,000 dead weight tons (dwt) are dismantled worldwide. They are scrapped and torn apart, each year, for re-use of the steel and other valuable materials they contain. In 2010, it is predicted that nearly 800 single-hull oil tankers will have to leave service. Approximately 100 warships and other government vessels flying EU flags - most of them French and British - are expected to be decommissioned in the next 10 years, according to the Commission's document.
MEPs in the committee warn that the current situation at the scrapping sites is bound to deteriorate further and that the issue should have been acted upon already ten years ago.
Increase EU's capacity for dismantling and create a register
Ship owners use a loophole that allows EU ships to at the same time be classified as waste and a ship under different regulations, and thus circumvent the ban on export of hazardous waste. The report criticises the lack of political will to close the loopholes and to tackle the structural hiding of responsibility in the shipping sector, which leads to a systematic disregarded for regulation and for the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal.
In order to enforce the rules and close loopholes the report calls for worldwide regulation by the International Maritime Organisation which, according to MEPs in the committee, would be the most effective way to protect the environment and public health.
However, since it is anticipated that such conventions are unlikely to enter into force before 2012, the report also calls for the Commission to establish a list to register and monitor 'pre-waste ships', as well as a list of preferred ship recycling facilities.
Even with such lists established, there would still be a lack of OECD ship dismantling facilities. However, since it is legitimate to move ships from OECD- to non-OECD-countries for scrapping, provided that they first have their toxic components removed, the report calls for immediate measures to develop the dismantling and pre-cleaning industry in the European Union. EU-approved dismantling sites in Asia is another option suggested by MEPs in the committee.
Transfer technology and set up a fund for dismantling
The report also calls on the Commission to promote the transfer of know-how and technology, thereby helping dismantling yards in Southern Asia to comply with international safety and environmental requirements.
MEPs in the committee welcome the proposal to establish a fund for ship dismantling. Available financial mechanisms, including a compulsory insurance requirement and the use of port fees, should be investigated.

Damaging the environment should be a criminal offence say MEPs
2008-05-15 - 09:44
Criminal sanctions should be employed to punish all severe offences committed against environment to ensure EU legislation in this field is properly applied. If the directive is approved, illegal conducts seriously damaging environment would be considered as crimes in all Member States. The Parliament has reached a first reading agreement with the Council on the proposed legislation which will be voted on in Strasbourg. MEPs in the committee recommend approving the report by Hartmut Nassauer (EPP-ED, DE), and agree on the principle that governments should apply criminal measures to punish any illegal behaviour likely to seriously injure people or damage air, soil, waters, plants and animals, when committed intentionally or with serious negligence.
Criminal law applies in case of infringement of Community legislation
The overall aim of the approved report is to ensure that all Member States consider as criminal offences a series of conducts provoking damages to the environment. In other words, if in an EU country one of the crimes listed in the report is currently subjected only to civil sanctions (e.g. a fine), the entry into force of this legislation would oblige national government to apply "effective, proportionate and dissuasive" criminal penalties to that specific case.
The committee also agrees that the discussed directive would only apply to cases of infringement of the EU legislation on the protection of environment, according to the list annexed to the report.
Sanctions for trading of protected fauna and ozone-depleting substances
The proposed text lists the emission of radiation into air, soil or water, the disposal of waste, the production, storage and transport of nuclear materials, among the offences that would be sanctioned by the criminal code, when likely to seriously injure people or the environment.
MEPs in the committee also back the inclusion of the possession, killing or possession of protected fauna and flora species, the deterioration of a habitat within a protected site, and the manufacture and distribution of ozone-depleting substances.
Court's ruling of October 2007
The Parliament further amended the original Commission proposal to make the directive consistent with a decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) of October 2007.
According to the ECJ, the EU has competence to adopt criminal measures only when there's a "justifiable need", e.g. in the common transport and environment policies. Nevertheless, the Court ruled that the EU cannot specify the type and level of the criminal sanctions. Therefore, MEPs propose to delete the article of the Commission text providing the extension and duration of the proposed sanctions.

MEPs to vote on a resolution on Myanmar and China following tragedies
2008-05-15 - 09:44
The House will debate the situation in Burma/Myanmar and China following the tragedies that have recently beset these countries. The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, has expressed his deep sympathy with all those affected by the serious earthquake in China. MEPs will vote on a resolution on these topics. In a letter to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, the President of Parliament extended his sincere condolences in view of the large number of victims and persons still missing.
"Our thoughts are with the injured and with the relatives of the victims of this serious earthquake. We all hope that many people can still be rescued alive from the rubble. Our sympathies are with all those people in China affected by this catastrophe," he said.
Myanmar
More than 34,000 people were killed in a devastating cyclone that hit western Burma on 3 May. EU development ministers met on 13 May in an extraordinary General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting in order to assess the state of play regarding the humanitarian situation in Burma/Myanmar after the devastation caused by the cyclone Nargis, and review the response of the EU member states and the European Commission.
The ministers stressed that the scope of the tragedy could increase without the co-operation of the authorities in Burma/Myanmar. They welcomed some limited improvement that has been made recently in this respect, but stressed that more needs to be done to ensure a free access to the affected area to the international humanitarian experts, including the expeditious delivery of visa and travel permits.
They recalled that the EU Humanitarian Aid is entirely neutral, impartial and independent, in accordance with the EU Consensus on Humanitarian Aid.
The ministers also welcomed the initiative of the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid Louis Michel to travel to Burma/Myanmar for purely humanitarian purposes.
Another subject of debate at the extraordinary GAERC meeting was Monday's devastating earthquake in China. The Council expressed its deepest condolences to the people of China for the massive loss of life and devastation caused by the earthquake which struck the country. The Ministers noted China's readiness to welcome foreign assistance, and expressed the European Union's readiness to provide it as soon as conditions on the ground permit it. Vote :

EU consumer policy strategy
2008-05-15 - 09:44
Lasse LEHTINEN (PES, FI) for the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, will be tabling a report on EU consumer policy strategy (2007-2013) which says that since the greatest obstacles to the development of an internal market in retailing include uncertainties regarding consumer contracts, supports the Commission in its efforts to introduce standard contracts and conditions for contracts concluded on-line which would have the same force in all the Member States. The report considers that the needs of consumer protection can be satisfied by legislation only if it is better, simpler and prepared with the involvement of all the competent Commission Directorates-General.
Funding for consumer organisations
The report emphasises the important role played by consumer organisations in improving consumer culture. The committee considers strong, independent consumer organisations to be the basis of an effective consumer policy and hence calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide adequate funding for such organisations.
27 national mini-markets
The report calls for measures to ensure that the 27 national mini-markets within the EU will actually be transformed into the largest retail market in the world. The committee takes the view that this requires that citizens feel equally safe shopping via the internet or at the local corner shop, and that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can rely on the same simple rules throughout the internal market. The Consumer Protection Committee calls on the Commission to consider ways of improving protection for SMEs, in particular by means of the Small Business Act.
European Consumer Ombudsman?
The committee calls on the Commission to explore the merits of establishing a special European Consumer Ombudsman in the European Ombudsman's office. The report notes that a number of Member States have consumer ombudsmen in several sectors, helping consumers to deal with economic operators; believes this approach could be examined by the Commission on a country-by-country basis.

Misleading 'Directory companies' (e.g. 'European City Guides')
2008-05-15 - 09:44
Arlene MCCARTHY (PES, UK), on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection will be asking the Council questions on Misleading 'Directory companies' (e.g. 'European City Guides'). Over the past years, a number of so-called 'Directory companies' (for instance 'European City Guides') have been operating cross-border in several EU Member States applying misleading and fraudulent business practices. The consequence of such scams is usually the unwanted 'registration' of professionals and small companies in rogue 'directories' for several years, at a cost of up to € 1000 per year. These amounts are then rigorously collected through specialised agencies, leaving the victims with a substantial financial loss and possibly also legal costs. When spotted and closed down, these companies have frequently managed to relocate and take up their fraudulent practices as before. IMCO Committee Members have received numerous complaints from citizens and the business community about such cases. The Committee therefore feels immediate and coordinated action by Member States is needed to prevent these 'directory companies' from operating and causing further damage to the European business community. The Committee therefore asks the Council of the European Union the following questions. Are Member States aware of the magnitude of this problem for the European business community, and particularly for SMEs? What action have they taken to close down these rogue 'directory companies'? Are Member States prepared to exchange information with other Member States' market surveillance authorities in order to warn them about fake 'directory companies'’ operations as well as their managers/owners? What steps are being undertaken to close loopholes created in the transposition of the Misleading Advertising Directive 84/450/EEC [1] ? What measures have Member States put in place to warn the business community about the threat of fake 'directory companies' and to assist those companies who are victims of these fraudulent practices? Do Member States agree that the Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practice (UCP) [2] , which also applies to advertising and aspects of misleading advertising directed at consumers, should be extended to business-to-business (B2B) transactions?

MEPs urge faster pace of reform in Turkey
2008-05-15 - 09:44
"Transform priorities and time-lines into reform plans," the Foreign Affairs Committee urged Turkey, in its latest progress report. The committee welcomes several recent legislative activities of Turkey, while insisting that the speed of reforms must pick up. The report, drawn up by Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP-ED, NL), "welcomes the commitment of Prime Minister Erdogan that 2008 is going to be the year of reforms" and "urges the Turkish government to fulfil its promises" by implementing them. While the committee stresses that "modernisation is first and foremost in Turkey's own interest," it also notes that "further delays will seriously affect the pace of negotiations."
The role of the judiciary and the military in modern Turkey
The committee is "concerned about the implications of the AK Party closure case," and "expects the Turkish Constitutional Court to respect principles of the rule of law, European standards and the Venice Commission guidelines on the prohibition of political parties." The report also "considers the amendment on Article 301 of the Penal Code sent by the government to the parliament as merely a first step towards a fundamental reform of this article as well as other articles" and "urges the government and the parliament to carry out this reform without delay so that none of these articles can be used for arbitrary restriction of freedom of expression."
The report "welcomes the fact that in 2007 democracy prevailed over attempts by the military to interfere in the political process," and encourages the government to "make further systematic efforts to ensure that the democratically elected political leadership bears full responsibility for formulation of domestic, foreign and security policy" and that "the armed forces fully respect this responsibility by fully and unambiguously acknowledging civilian control."
The Kurdish question
The report urges the Turkish government to launch "a political initiative favouring a lasting settlement of the Kurdish issue," including a "comprehensive master plan to boost the socio-economic and cultural development of the south-east of Turkey." It also calls for "'real possibilities to learn Kurdish within the public and private schooling system" and its use in broadcasting, public life and public services. While considering that a possible ban of the Democratic Society Party (DTP) would be "counterproductive to a political solution," and deploring the "many court cases brought against elected mayors and other politicians for using the Kurdish language," as well as the recent conviction of Leyla Zana, the report "calls upon the DTP party, its members of parliament and mayors to distance themselves clearly from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)" and calls on the PKK to declare and respect an immediate ceasefire.
Gender issues
In light of the drafting of a new constitution, the committee stresses that it should "ensure gender equality, avoid the use of vague criteria such as general morality, refrain from perceiving women primarily as family or community members and reaffirm women's human rights." It also notes "the disappointment and concern of part of the population that the lifting of the ban on wearing headscarves in universities was not part of a broader package of reform based on a wide ranging consultation of civil society."

Agriculture
Animal health strategy should be conformed to EU ambitions
2008-05-15 - 09:44
MEPs in the Agriculture Committee support the objectives of the Commission's Animal Health Strategy for the EU, but call for more ambition and stress that such objectives can only be achieved with a sufficient and clearly defined budget. They also strongly support vaccination, which according to them should be recognised as one of the more important methods to prevent diseases. The report by Janusz WOJCIECHOWSKI (UEN, PL) welcomes the strategy, which will reinforce the EU's "protection mechanisms and preparedness in the face of the onset of new epizootic diseases", such as the H5N1 virus of avian flu, foot-and-mouth and the blue tongue virus which have devastated herds in the UK and other parts of the EU and have had an important impact on meat consumption and citizen's trust towards the farming sector.
The strategy aims to strengthen public health protection and food safety, reduce the occurrence of animal diseases, support economic growth by favouring the freedom of circulation of animals and animal products, and promote animal welfare and environment protection.
Although these aims are supported, the report on behalf of the Agricultural Committee highlights a number of issues where the Commission's strategy "fails to pay sufficient attention".
Financing the strategy
The report calls for the Commission to clarify the role of the EU, Member States and the agricultural sector in financing the animal health measures, for example, ensuring biological security on farms, vaccination programmes, scientific research and higher animal welfare standards.
Mr Wojciechowski draws attention to the fact that the common animal health policy is one of the most integrated EU policies and states that "most of its funding should be covered by the Community budget, which should not preclude the financial responsibility of the Member States and farmers".
Use of vaccinations as part of disease eradication operations
The Agriculture Committee strongly supports action to increase the use of emergency vaccinations as part of disease eradication operations, to introduce income guarantees for owners of vaccinated animals "since they may face problems selling products from vaccinated animals", and to expand "EU vaccination banks".
The report states that measures should be applied to "reduce the number of healthy animals slaughtered and disposed of, such as tests to prove that animals are free from pathogens", and that it is essential to ensure the availability of "humane means of carrying out any necessary culling of animals that will spare them unnecessary suffering".
To ensure the "indiscriminate circulation of products derived from vaccinated animals", the report calls on the Commission and Member States "for a ban on consumer labelling of products derived from vaccinated animals" and to use "effective public communication strategies regarding the harmlessness of products derived from vaccinated animals".
The report supports the development of vaccination strategies for all relevant species and diseases, and recalls Parliament's amendments to the 2008 EU Budget to increase appropriations for the development of vaccines and testing methods.
Prevention of risks
The Agriculture Committee notes that compensation funds for animal owners based on a reserve system strengthen individual and shared responsibility with detecting and eradicating disease, and believes that the compensation system should be combined with risk-prevention incentives for farmers and the possibility of covering indirect losses from disease-eradication measures through national insurance instruments.
The report points out that "high stocking densities in intensive farming systems may increase the risk of disease spread and hamper disease control" and the importance of distance between farms and transporting animals in controlling epidemic diseases.
International aspects
The Agriculture Committee urges in the EU to defend its high animal health and welfare standards at an international level within the WTO and to possibly become a member of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to "increase animal health and welfare standards globally".
Committee members are concerned that European products could be undermined by imports from third countries where the farmers do not face the same obligations with regards to animal health and welfare. For example, the delay in taking measures to ensure that imports of Brazilian beef came only from cattle that were free of foot-and-mouth disease at the end of 2007 undermined "public confidence in the EU animal health regime."
As the EU is the world's largest importer of food and animal products, the report considers that, "in view of the risk of infection-carrying or diseased animals being brought into the EU, veterinary and sanitary checks at EU borders need to particularly thorough and stringent", including ascertaining whether animals have been reared in accordance with EU animal welfare standards instead of only checking documents.
The committee stresses the importance of animal health inspections within third countries and asks for an increase in the financial resources of the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office.
What is next
If passed when voted on by the European Parliament on Thursday (22 May), this own initiative report will be followed by Commission legislative proposals to be adopted under co-decision. A Commission Action Plan with detailed timetable is expected for the summer (July or September).

Transfer of tobacco aid for to the Community Tobacco Fund
2008-05-15 - 09:44
MEPs will debate and vote on amendments to extend by six years the financing of the Community Tobacco Fund, which is funded by EU tobacco producers and finances information campaigns on the dangers of tobacco. The consultation report by Sergio BERLATO (UEN, IT) on the Commission's proposals for the Community Tobacco Fund calls on the Commission to amend the suggestion to transfer 5% of the tobacco aid granted for the calendar years 2008 and 2009 to the Community Tobacco Fund.
Instead of this, the report proposes a more ambitious 6% transfer every year until 2013, stating that the fight against tobacco consumption is a priority for the Parliament and the use of the fund for information initiatives on the damage tobacco can cause is "of value to all EU citizens".
The report is linked to an old request by the Parliament aimed at ensuring the continuation of aid to EU tobacco producers until 2013, whereas the 2004 reform of the sector decided that the link between tobacco production and support to farmers should be cut in 2010 at the latest.
Production of tobacco in the EU
The EU is the world's leading importer of tobacco. It is also the fifth largest producer, behind China, Brazil, India and the United States. There are currently nine tobacco-producing EU Member States: Greece, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Portugal, Poland and Bulgaria.

An integrated maritime policy for the EU - 20 May to be designated European Maritime Day
2008-05-15 - 09:44
The committee, in an own-initiative report, feels that the Action Plan includes too few practical measures and urges the Commission to use the instruments at its disposal under the EU Treaty. It is felt that climate change challenges are addressed in a non-binding way, and that it should be the task of European Maritime Policy to prepare in particular for rising sea levels, with the increased risk of flooding of ports and of coastal regions. The melting of glaciers causes not only a rise in sea levels, but also irreparable damage to human, animal and plant life. Therefore, the Commission's initiative to put forward an Arctic Initiative is welcome.
Establish a European Maritime Day
MEPs back a proposal to establish an annual Maritime Day. Such an action day should be used to establish the significance of maritime policy outside maritime circles, with the participation of ordinary citizens, schools, universities and non-governmental organisations.
The European Maritime Day will highlight the contribution that oceans and seas make to helping Europe meet the challenges of a globalised world. It will be an opportunity to celebrate Europe's maritime heritage and maritime identity. It will help raise awareness of the importance of the maritime industries and sectors in Europe's overall economy, and emphasise the key role of Europe's coastal regions.
The event
On 20 May in Strasbourg, President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering, Council President Janez Janša, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso will officially launch the first European Maritime Day by signing the Joint Tripartite Declaration establishing a "European Maritime Day". A photo opportunity/press point will be organised at the EP.
Reducing emissions
MEPs in the committee call for maritime policy to make a substantial contribution to reducing greenhouse emissions, including incorporating shipping in emissions trading and stepping up research efforts with a view to exploiting the seas as a source of renewable energy. They also urge the Commission to be more ambitious in combating sulphur and NOx emissions as well as the emissions from ships.
In this connection, the House reiterates the need for closer cooperation in this field with the IMO (International Maritime Organisation) and, in particular, calls for:
- the introduction of nitrogen oxide emission standards for ships using EU ports;
- the designation of the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the North-East Atlantic as Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs);
- the reduction of the maximum permitted sulphur content in marine fuels used in SECAs by passenger vessels from 1,5% to 0,5%;
- the introduction of fiscal measures, such as taxes or charges on sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ships and the identification of ways of imposing such measures and charges on all ships, regardless of flag, putting into Community ports or sailing within EU waters;
- promotion of the introduction of differentiated harbour and waterway charges to favour ships with low sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions;
- a proposal for an EU directive on the quality of marine fuels.
Land-based pollution
Members also point out that land-based pollution of the sea constitutes a significant proportion of overall maritime pollution and that the Commission has yet to get grips with this issue. The Commission should put forward an action plan to reduce such pollution and the Member States should act promptly to transpose the legislation in this field into their national laws. They add that an action plan is also needed to identify and remove old munitions from past wars dumped in the North Sea and the Baltic.
Social and labour protection for seafarers
Seafarers should no longer be excluded from certain areas of European social and labour protection, such as safeguards for employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, rules on collective redundancies and on the posting of workers to provide services. The directives concerned should be revised in close cooperation with the social partners.
Fisheries
The key objective of an EU maritime policy in the field of fisheries should be to promote the modernisation and sustainable development of the industry throughout the EU. Although the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been serving well the industry in general, future policy should be developed in such a way to avoid failings in the CFP such as over-centralisation and the failure to take account of the regional diversity of the European waters. MEPs in the committee call for mutual recognition by the Member States of intermediate diplomas for the occupation of steersman and mechanic for fishing vessels. Finally, they reiterate the need for mechanisms to subsidise or compensate fishermen who are affected by the repercussions of stock recovery plans or measures to protect ecosystems, especially in less favoured regions and communities and the outermost regions.

Transport by road deal nears its end
2008-05-15 - 09:44
Parliament is to debate and vote on three reports on proposals aimed at modernising the rules governing admission to the occupation of transport operator and access to the road transport market. The Commission proposals provide for compulsory training for transport managers, an enforceable definition of cabotage which can be carried out within a Member State and mechanisms for imposing sanctions across the national borders. MEPs are negotiating a first-reading deal with the Council. 1. On stricter rules for the admission to the road transport sector
This report concerns the financial criteria and good standing requirements required to enter the road transport occupation. It endorses, in particular, proposals to employ qualified transport managers, provisions on the good repute of an operator and the withdrawal of licences of operators convicted of serious offences. (Silvia-Adriana ŢICĂU (PES, RO) report)
Qualified managers must be a resident of a Member State. The Transport Committee is also in favour of a list of infringements which may lead to the loss of good repute of an operator. Transport operators must also provide proof of their financial standing on the basis of financial indicators to their short-term solvency on the basis of bank guarantees. To ensure fair competition, companies must have an office in an operating centre, to eliminate the phenomenon of letterbox companies.
Managers must give evidence of their professional competence and if serious infringements are committed under their responsibility, they will be disqualified and will not be able to work as a transport manager within the EU. But a majority in the committee removed "minor" infringements from the disqualifiers for occupation entrance and also simplified the financial requirements for entry into the occupation.
Any company wishing to gain admission to the sector will have to employ a transport manager who can provide of professional competence (140 hours of training and examination).
2. On the international carriage by coach and bus
This report on the access to the market for coach and bus services is governed by two regulations concerning the liberalisation of international occasional services. Following the adoption of the Regulation on public service obligations PSO, the proposal seeks to simplify the legislative framework and to adapt the authorisation procedure for international services to the PSO regulation. Furthermore, the Transport Committee voted in favour of a special regulation for regular international transport in border regions (Mathieu GROSCH (EPP-ED, BE) report).
3. Access to the market in the carriage of goods by road within the Community
The access to the international road haulage and cabotage market is currently governed by different Regulations and Directives dating back to 1962. The current proposal is therefore a recast. It intends to simplify and to clarify the rules applied to road haulage. The most important issue is that on cabotage: when and to what degree may a haulier from one state pick up and drop off in another.
Cabotage aims at avoiding empty transport trips but there are fears that mostly transport companies from low wages will use cabotage and therefore the Transport Committee adopted the rapporteur's proposal to temporarily limit cabotage to three trips carried out on international routes within a delay of maximum seven consecutive days. The Committee also proposes allowing cabotage after the partial unloading of trucks and in transit countries on return trips.
Finally, a majority in the Committee is proposing that cabotage should be made independent of whether or not the vehicle is fully unloaded and that restrictions on cabotage operations be lifted by 2014. (Mathieu GROSCH (EPP-ED, BE) report).

Employment policy
Progress made in equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the EU
2008-05-15 - 09:44
The European Parliament will debate and vote on calls for a "comprehensive directive" to combat any discrimination on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. The own initiative report by Elizabeth LYNNE (ALDE, UK) on the progress made in equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the EU also demands effective sanctions and support for victims. MEPs in the committee welcome the Commission's plans to draw up a comprehensive directive in June to combat discrimination outside employment on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation under Article 13 of the EC Treaty, but believe that the directive should make it clear that there is no hierarchy between the different forms of discrimination as "it does not make sense to outlaw discrimination in one area whilst allowing it in another".
The report invites Member States and the Commission to urgently agree on broad definitions of disability in order to facilitate the harmonisation of anti-discrimination legislation.
Combat all forms of discrimination
Any new directive should prohibit all forms of discrimination, including direct and indirect discrimination, in all areas that fall under EU competence as well as education, lifelong learning, social protection and social security, housing and healthcare, images of discriminated groups in the media and advertising, physical access for people with disabilities to information, telecommunication, electronic communications, transport modes and public spaces, social advantages and access to and supply of goods and services which are available to the public, states the report.
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to adopt a balanced broad concept of multiple discrimination and to include provisions explicitly designed to combat multiple discrimination in any future legislation, "which can be invoked on either one or a combination of more than one of the grounds".
Differences in treatment based on nationality or language which may constitute indirect discrimination is also included in the report.
Deficiencies in implementation of existing legislation
The report expresses concern about deficiencies in the transposition and implementation of the two existing directives: on equal treatment in employment and occupation (Directive 2000/78/EC) and of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (Directive 2000/43/EC).
As a result, the report urges the Commission to put pressure on the Member States, by way of infringement and non-compliance procedures, to respect their legal obligations in fully transposing these directives as soon as possible.
MEPs in the committee believe that exceptions linked to marital status in Directive 2000/78/EC has limited the protection against discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation offered by the Directive.
Effective sanctions and assistance for victims
The report urges that sanctions against a violation of national provisions must be "effective, propionate and dissuasive".
As the burden is often on the individual to challenge the perpetrator of discrimination "often with neither support from any public authority nor access to public funding for legal aid", the report stresses that Member States should ensure the victims of discrimination are automatically assisted in legal proceedings, if necessary by public funding through national legal aid schemes.
Governments of Member States are also urged to ensure equal treatment and opportunities under employment and social inclusion policies, and in particular, "to address the serious barriers raised by discrimination in recruitment procedures".
Lastly, the report considers that minority communities, and in particular the Roma community, need special protection "since their problems of exploitation, discrimination and exclusion have become even more acute in the areas of education, health, housing, employment and women's rights", and that special attention be paid to encounter all forms of discrimination encountered in education.

Employment policy
MEPs to vote on revision of Employment Guidelines
2008-05-15 - 09:44
Tax-benefit structures should not discriminate against women, and workers should be encouraged to prolong their working lives, says the Employment Committee's report on the EU's guidelines for employment policies that will be debated by MEPs. The report also mentions of the targets to be reached by 2010, such as an average rate of early school leavers of no more than 10% or a raise in the effective retirement age by five years. The consultation report drafted by Anne VAN LANCKER (PES, BE) on the Commission's proposal for guidelines for the employment policies of Member States wishes to include "measures to ensure that people combining work and care are not penalised late in life" by pensions and social security benefits, and the encouragement of workers to prolong their working life if they want to retire later.
The Employment Committee calls for a review of tax-benefit structures that impact negatively on women's participation in the labour force and the implementation of new guidelines on active social integration. These guidelines include aims to tackle poverty and social exclusion more efficiently by guaranteeing a decent income and better access to quality social services.
Noting that proficiency in a number of languages facilitates worker mobility and "is necessary in the European Union", the report calls on the Commission to provide for foreign language learning as part of initial and lifelong training.
The report also includes calls on the Commission to prevent "brain drain" from peripheral regions, reduce periods of unemployment, prevent illicit work and prevent pupils from leaving school without qualifications.
Situation in UK and Ireland
In 2006 both the UK and Ireland were above the EU average for their general levels of employment, with a total employment rate of 71.6% and 68.6% respectively compared to the EU average of 64.6%, and well above average with the employment rate of older workers (57.4% and 53.1 % compared to the EU average of 43.5%) (see link below).
However, significant progress needs to be made for the UK and Ireland to reach the other 2010 targets of the European Employment Strategy mentioned in the report, such as the average level of participation in lifelong learning and the provision of childcare to children between three years old and the mandatory school age.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
More female scientists needed, says report
2008-05-15 - 09:44
The report by the Women's Rights Committee calls for gender balance on decision-making bodies, mainstreaming of the male-female dimension in research programmes and support for scientific careers for women to increase the number of female scientists in the EU. Research is a key sector for the EU's economic development: Europe needs to recruit 700,000 additional researchers under the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment.
However, female researchers are in a minority within the EU, comprising of only 35% of researchers in government and the public sector and only 18% of researchers in the private sector. This is also the case in the UK and Ireland, where the proportion of female researchers is is line with the EU average (see link hereunder).
The report by Britta THOMSEN (PES, DK) seeks to address the barriers that account for this under-representation which is limiting Europe's capacity to reach its full scientific potential, including the persistence of stereotypes in Europe's teaching systems, the low number of women in decision-making bodies and a lack of transparency in recruitment procedures.
Gender balance in decision-making bodies
The report calls on the Commission and Member States for more transparent recruitment processes and for an obligation to ensure gender balance in evaluation panels and committees, with a target of at least 40% women and at least 40% men.
Fighting stereotypes and mainstreaming the male-female dimension in EU programmes
Universities, research institutes and private businesses are encouraged to adopt and enforce equality strategies in the organisation, including more "gender neutral" approaches to evaluating performance.
The report considers that Gender Action Plans within the proposal and evaluation stage of the EU's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) is an essential part of the EU's gender equality programme and therefore should remain an integral part of European research funding.
Encouraging scientific careers for women
The report calls on the commission and the Member States to take positive action to encourage female researchers, such as setting up support programmes for young women scientists and strengthening networking among female scientists at national, regional and EU level.
Votes
The report was adopted by the Women's Rights Committee by twelve votes for and eight abstentions, with the main point of conflict being the issue of quotas. Rapporteur Britta THOMSEN PES DK A6-0165/2008 Women and science Procedure : own-initiative

External/international trade
Trade in raw materials and commodities- MEPs concerned about supply
2008-05-15 - 09:44
The Committee on International Trade is proposing an own-initiative report by Jens HOLM (GUE/NGL, SE) on trade in raw materials and commodities. MEPs in the committee are concerned by the prospect of an increasing demand for raw materials on world markets and by the trend to restrict free access to raw materials in third countries by trade distorting measures. They insist on the need to guarantee the supply of raw materials to the European Union and to ensure access to raw materials on the world markets.
The report notes that the European Union currently does not provide a coherent strategy to face the challenges for the competitiveness of its economy due to enhanced competition in access to raw materials. Therefore, the Commission is called upon to:
promote investment in research and development in technologies for the recycling of raw materials and the efficient and economic use of raw materials;
address the issue of free and fair access to raw material markets in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO);
actively pursue the objective of multilateral elimination of trade distorting measures in the sector of raw materials, while fully respecting restrictions based on developmental grounds for least developed countries (LDCs);
give more weight to the issue of free and non-discriminatory access to raw material markets in all bilateral negotiations on free trade agreements or WTO accessions;
include the issue of raw materials in the market access strategy.
MEPs in the committee regret that many developing countries, and in particular LDCs, have been locked into the production and export of raw materials and commodities whose volatile prices have been declining over the long term, constituting a serious impediment to the alleviation of poverty. However, they recognise that increasing commodity prices have contributed to significant improvements in the external accounts of some developing countries dependent on primary commodities.
The report underlines the inherent opportunities for the producer countries in the exploration and management of raw material deposits. It supports current efforts in developing countries, and in particular in LDCs, to diversify their economies and to secure access to food for the local populations. Developing countries are encouraged to raise the necessary investments and consolidate economic diversification through strengthened infrastructure and institutional capacity building, promoting good governance in managing economic development as well as facilitating access and distribution of products from small-scale producers to local markets.
MEPs in the committee consider that in the long term regional economic and trade cooperation should be fostered and could lead to free trade agreements. In this respect, the EuroMed free trade agreement should be a priority given the importance of trade in raw materials in this region.
To enable developing countries, and in particular LDCs, to benefit from raw materials, MEPs call on the Commission to:
implement a comprehensive and balanced strategy in the field of access to raw materials taking into account the interests of EU industry and developing countries;
support national commodity development and diversification strategies in LDCs with support from the European Development Fund when necessary;
use aid-for-trade as an important tool for development as well as strengthening existing mechanisms for transfer of technology, especially as a means to manage climate change;
promote and invest in the transfer of environmentally friendly technologies;
promote transparency of the revenues stemming from raw materials via programmes like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process;
review its compensatory finance scheme, FLEX, to ensure it is responsive and effective in supporting developing countries and in particular LDCs;
to step up its efforts to obtain an international agreement on conflict resources whose primary objective would be to prohibit all trade in resources fuelling or resulting from armed conflicts.
The Council and the Commission are called upon to:
ensure that multilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements signed by the European Union are in accordance with the objective of sustainable development;
promote Fair Trade, and other independently monitored trading initiatives contributing to raising social and environmental standards.
Lastly, the parliamentary committee points out that the new trading policy of some emerging countries, especially China, searching for raw materials worldwide, in particular in Africa, is having a major and negative impact on the European Union's access to commodities in this continent, because of an approach based on one-to-one relations between states and neglecting references to human rights, corporate social responsibility and environmental and social standards.

Regional policy
Learning the lessons of the PEACE programme
2008-05-15 - 09:44
The experience gained from the PEACE programmes in Ireland, positive results and best practice, what may be improved, challenges still to be faced and lessons to be learned are set out in an own-initiative report by Bairbre DE BRÚN (GUE/NGL, UK) for the Regional Development Committee. Lessons from these programmes could help elsewhere, within and beyond EU borders. The possibility of creating a Europe-wide network of regions and cities living with, or emerging from, conflict and exclusion is now under discussion, notes the report.
Lessons
Local empowerment is essential to peace-building, because civil society participation improves policy making and governance.
Experience in dealing with EU funds, and in developing provision mechanisms that involve the voluntary sector, non-governmental organisations and local authorities, could serve in other, similar funding programmes.
Establishing a network of enterprise centres in deprived areas contributes to economic and social development, and helps boost confidence and hope.
Co-operation among participants in EU-funded programmes should not stop once EU funding comes to an end - government departments are asked to consider how to maintain this work, so as to ensure that mainstream funding continues thereafter.
When structuring future initiatives, the Commission is asked, in relation to its task force on Northern Ireland, to replicate the "active citizenship" approach from the PEACE I and PEACE II programmes, [and to step up its support for infrastructure improvement]
Cross-border work is central to regenerating urban and rural communities, and should be further developed, as should [co-operation between local chambers of commerce and] working relationships and forums for the voluntary and community sectors on both sides of the border [and for voluntary organisations that already work on a cross-border basis]
Funding programmes should make widespread use of both large and small-scale local consultations and include schemes that allow for the approval of small grants to fund work that is needed at short notice [as well as schemes that allow for long-term sustainability and can make a contribution to local communities].
A reduction in bureaucracy is needed to ensure that small projects are not overburdened.
Progress takes time. Peace-building is an evolutionary process, and individual grants need longer time frames to allow projects to make a difference.
It is important to consult the voluntary and community sectors in order to develop local strategies, and local businesses are also influential participants.
Development in rural areas requires greater synergies between rural and regional development funding than has been the case to date.
A database could be created as a learning tool for work on peace and reconciliation at home and abroad, including success stories from projects funded by PEACE I, PEACE II and the International Fund for Ireland. Experience from projects under these programmes should inform other international peace-building work, as part of a two-way process.
PEACE programmes
PEACE programmes benefit a wide range of sectors, areas, groups and communities and encourage cross-community projects. The bulk of PEACE funding is managed by local partners and NGOs, enabling various sections of the community to work together.
The Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation 1995-1999 (PEACE I), allocated €750m to 15,000 projects. Designed with a lot of local community input, it helped legislators to learn how to work with voluntary sector and community partners.
The EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation 2000-2006 (PEACE II), allocated €994m to 7,000 projects. PEACE II placed more emphasis on the economy and economic viability, but some of the "bottom-up" approach was lost, says the rapporteur.
The current PEACE III programme (2007-2013) is expected to provide total funding of about €333m. It stresses reconciliation, and seeks to use the work of Hamber and Kelly1.
Since 1989, the EU has also been a key contributor to the International Fund for Ireland, established by the Irish and British governments in 1986. The other contributors are the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Under PEACE II programme measure 4.1, there was an exchange of experience at project level between areas across Europe and further afield, including Albania, Belarus, Moldova, Serbia, the Ukraine and Bosnia.

Regional policy
Strategy for the outermost regions - achievements and future prospects
2008-05-15 - 09:44
EU action should act as a catalyst for a spirit of enterprise that, on the basis of public/private partnerships, turns its outermost regions into centres of excellence driven by sectors that fully utilise their advantages and know-how, such as waste management, renewable energies, energy self-sufficiency, biodiversity, student mobility, climate research or crisis management, says an own-initiative report by Margie SUDRE (EPP-ED, FR). The EU's seven outermost regions (Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Réunion, Martinique, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands) give the EU an economic zone covering 25 million km2 and act as European bridgeheads for fostering trade relations with their neighbours. However, these regions also have severe economic handicaps, including remoteness from the European mainland, insularity, difficult topography and climate, inadequate transport services and small markets.
So far, the political priorities of the EU, which the report states must remain consistent with the ever more binding international commitments dictated by globalisation such as within the WTO, frequently run counter to the specific measures taken to assist the outermost regions.
As a result, the report by Margie SUDRE with the aim of guaranteeing genuine prosperity for the regions' populations, argues that all community policies must include specific measures to offset these handicaps, for example, in the fields of customs and trade, fiscal policy, agriculture and fisheries, state aid and regional policy.
MEPs in the committee wish to see proper consideration given to the financial impact which the ongoing international negotiations and the measures undertaken at the WTO may have on the sugar cane, rum and bananas sectors, and urges the Commission to seek compromises to protect the interests of outermost regions when final Economic Partnership Agreements are reached with ACP countries.
MEPs in the committee also recommend that ways of overcoming the narrowness of local markets, the increasingly open competitive environment and the difficulty of finding market outlets locally or in mainland Europe markets should be priorities for debate, together with effective participation in EU policies to promote innovation and bridge the digital divide.

Ensuring pan-European coverage for mobile satellite services
2008-05-15 - 09:44
Draft rules providing for systems providing mobile satellite services - such as broadband internet or mobile TV - to be selected at EU level in the future are backed by the Industry Committee. Parliament will vote on a first-reading compromise package, negotiated with Council, which lays down that each system has to provide services in at least 60% of the EU's total area when it starts operating and should cover at least half of each Member States' population after seven years at the latest. "The challenge is to get the best possible deal for citizens, especially for those in the more peripheral countries and regions of the EU, while ensuring that the requirements demanded of applicants are realistic", said Rapporteur Fiona HALL (ALDE, UK). She added that "time is also of the essence because the EU satellite service industry faces fierce competition on the global market".
Mobile satellite systems can offer a wide range of pan-European telecommunications and broadcasting services - from high-speed internet through mobile TV to emergency communications. The proposed decision will lay down common procedures for the selection of operators providing mobile satellite services as well as provisions for a coordinated authorisation by national authorities. The aim is "to facilitate the development of a competitive internal market for mobile satellite services across the Community and to ensure gradual coverage in all Member States", says the text as amended by the Industry Committee.
Selection should emphasise pan-European coverage and public policy objectives
The committee adds a provision to the proposal saying that no more than 15 MHz for Earth to space and 15 MHz for space to Earth can be assigned to one applicant. If the combined demand of all applicants exceeds the amount of radio spectrum available, the Commission will select operators following certain criteria.
MEPs in the committee want these selection criteria to be clearly defined and weighted. Strong emphasis will be put on pan-European geographic coverage (with 40% weighting) and public policy objectives like public protection (20% weighting). Consumer and competitive benefits shall account for 20% of the eligibility, spectrum efficiency for 20%.
Services have to reach at least half of the EU's population and 60 % of its land area
Each system has to cover at least 60% of the EU's overall land area when it starts operating, says the co-decision report. After 7 years at the latest the mobile satellite service must be provided within all Member States covering at least 50% of their population and 60% of each Member States land area.
Background
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has designated the 2 GHz radio frequency band for use by mobile satellite systems. The radio spectrum from 1980 to 2010 MHz is used for Earth to space (upstream) communications and the spectrum from 2170 to 2200 MHz for space to Earth (downstream) communications. Member States, who own the radio spectrum, have agreed to give up their national rights on spectrum allocation to make these frequency bands available for a common European approach.

Industry Committee supports establishment of Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking
2008-05-15 - 09:44
The Industry Committee is backing the Commission's plans for a 5th Joint Technology Initiative for research on hydrogen and fuel cells. Under the Seventh Research Framework Programme the Community will invest EUR 470 million. Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs) are introduced in the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) as a way of creating public-private partnerships in research at European level. The "Co-operation" Specific Programme identifies fuel cells and hydrogen as one of six areas where a JTI could be particularly relevant, alongside aeronautics and air transport, innovative medicines, embedded computing systems, nanoelectronics and global monitoring for environment and security (GMES). JTIs arise mainly from the work of European Technology Platforms (ETPs). In a small number of cases, ETPs have achieved such an ambitious scale and scope that they will require the mobilisation of high public and private investments as well as substantial research resources to implement important elements of their Strategic Research Agendas. JTIs are proposed as an effective means of meeting the needs of these ETPs.
The new public-private partnership shall "aim at placing the European Union at the forefront of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies and at enabling the market breakthrough of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies, so that the substantial benefits expected of such technology can be achieved by the market", says the non-binding consultation report drafted by Pia Elda LOCATELLI (PSE, IT). The Commission should therefore guarantee adequate support for long-term research in the field.
Under the Seventh Research Framework Programme the Community will provide EUR 470 million for the JTI. MEPs stress that in line with FP7 SMEs, research centres and universities may receive a maximum public funding of eligible costs of up to 75%.
The Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Undertaking shall have its seat in Brussels, Belgium, and should cease working by the end of 2017. The Industry Committee opposes a possible extension of the Joint Technology Initiative after this period. Instead MEPs clarify that after the last call for proposals in 2013 all running projects have to be implemented, monitored and funded until 2017.

Promote sustainable industries but avoid unemployment and carbon leakage, says Industry Committee
2008-05-15 - 09:44
The EU's climate change and renewable energy goals should be seen as a chance for EU industries to become world leaders in sustainable technologies, says an own-initiative report on industrial policy proposed by the Industry Committee. Yet, a relocation of European industries to countries with less strict environmental policies should be avoided as well, stress MEPs in the committee. "The EU's environmental goals should not be seen as a threat to industry", says the own-initiative report drafted by Romana JORDAN CIZELJ (EPP-ED, SI). Rather the EU's renewable energy and climate change objectives should be regarded "as an opportunity to gain a first mover advantage and make industry in the EU a world leader in environmentally friendly and socially acceptable technologies, products and services", stress MEPs in the committee.
Avoid relocation of European industries, unemployment and 'carbon leakage'
They underline that the Commission's Action Plan for sustainable industrial policy, which it plans to put forward on 14 May, should facilitate the gradual transition towards a low carbon and energy- and resource-efficient industry (amendment 5). At the same time, the Industry Committee stresses that unemployment and 'carbon leakage' should be avoided i.e. the EU's strict climate policy goals should not prompt companies to relocate their production to countries with a less strict climate policy which would lead to increased CO2 emissions by these countries and to higher unemployment in the EU. Thus, MEPs in the committee urge the Commission to set up global sectoral agreements which reduce the environmental impact of specific industries worldwide
As "the EU is completely dependent on imports of several metals", MEPs in the committee ask the Commission to propose integrated measures on how to guarantee sustainable access to raw materials.
Introduce a European patent and combat counterfeiting
Moreover, MEPs in the committee call for a transparent, simplified intellectual property rights policy "that is actually enforced". Hence, the Council should introduce as soon as possible a European patent while the Commission should keep on combating counterfeiting by seeking global solutions in this area.
Cut red tape and remove tax obstacles for SMEs
The committee also calls on the Commission to "properly apply the so-called 'think small first' principle" in all EU policies. Therefore, MEPs in the committee "strongly support" the Small Business Act which the Commission plans to present on 2 July. This Small Business Act should be a legislative proposal which includes "new, concrete initiatives" to cut the red tape for SMEs. The proposal should also guarantee that SMEs have access to financial resources and to research infrastructure, say MEPs in the committee.
The report also stresses that an EU-wide market for venture capital should urgently be established "by removing existing regulatory and tax obstacles to venture capital investments in Europe's most innovative small firms".

Follow-up to the 2005 Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness
2008-05-15 - 09:44
Simplifying aid procedures and phasing out economic policy conditionality are among the demands of the EP Committee on Development in a report on aid effectiveness to developing countries. To be more efficient, aid should also be disbursed according to partners´ own priorities and timetables, says the report. The report also underlines the necessary fight against corruption. The Paris Declaration, endorsed on 2 March 2005, is an international agreement to which over one hundred Ministers, Heads of Agencies and other Senior Officials adhered and committed their countries and organisations to continue to increase efforts in harmonisation, alignment and managing aid for results with a set of monitorable actions and indicators.
The 'international aid effectiveness agenda' established by the Paris Declaration in 2005 aims to ensure that the ultimate objective of the aid system as a whole, namely the fight against poverty, is being met.
With this in mind, the report drafted by Johan VAN HECKE (ALDE, BE) calls on the Commission to set up two new instruments: an indicator to monitor parliamentary scrutiny in the countries receiving development aid which will increase accountability and permit more strategic forms of oversight, and a revision of the Donor Atlas initiative to promote cross-country policy dialogue between European donors and tackle the problem of orphan countries and sectors.
MEPs in the Committee on Development call for the simplification of aid procedures and "considers that increasing transparency of information on aid flows is a critical objective for improving the effective use of aid and mutual accountability".
In recognition of the role of corruption in obstructing the effectiveness of aid, the report calls on the Commission to "ensure greater accountability as well as transparency of countries' public financial management systems" and to take practical measures to fight corruption, for example, by supporting civil society initiatives.
Member States and the Commission are urged to "phase out policy-oriented conditionality" to support a common understanding on key priorities, and the report stresses the need for the international financial institutions and donor countries to publish the conditions for granting development aid, "so that genuine democratic control can be exercised by parliaments, local authorities and civil societies".
The report also stresses the need to disburse aid according to the partners' priorities and timelines, and supports the Commission's choice to increasingly use budget support, enabling national parliaments, local authorities, civil society and the EP to trace the results of the EU contributions.
Finally, the role of women and diasporas are highlighted in the report, as there is a disproportionate impact of poverty on women and the involvement of people of foreign origin in a partnership between the EU and their country of origin "is a powerful factor of integration".
UK and Ireland
In 2007 Ireland reached its highest ever level for development aid with 0.54% of GNP, an increase of 6.7% on its 2006 figures. Within the European Union, only Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg allocate a greater percentage of GNP to overseas development assistance than Ireland.
The UK is among the eleven EU Member States to reduce its development contributions, resulting in the percentage spent on development aid across the EU falling from 0.41% of GNP in 2006 to 0.38% in 2007. The EU Member States have spent less on development aid than they had promised, with 1.8 billion euros missing.

Global treaty to ban uranium weapons
2008-05-15 - 09:44
Elly de Groen-Kouwenhoven, Angelika Beer and Caroline Lucas, on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group, Luisa Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Ana Maria Gomes, on behalf of the PES Group, Ģirts Valdis Kristovskis, on behalf of the UEN Group will be asking the Council and Commission questions on global treaty to ban uranium weapons. The use of Depleted Uranium in warfare runs counter to the basic rules and principles enshrined in written and customary International Humanitarian and Environmental Law. Therefore, in November 2006, the European Parliament strengthened its previous calls for a moratorium on uranium weapons by adopting its resolution on ‘biological weapons and inhumane conventional weapons’. There is increasing support worldwide. In March 2007 Belgium adopted its national law to forbid the manufacture, use, storage, sale, acquisition, supply and transit of uranium weapons. In May 2007 the European Parliament exhibited the pictures and testimonies of victims of uranium weapons in Iraq (70% of Iraq is covered with DU dust).
In October 2007 the Italian Defence Minister disclosed that between 1996 and 2006, 37 Italian soldiers most probably died because of exposure to uranium weapons on their missions to Iraq and the Balkans. In several other countries similar cases occurred, affecting hundreds of veterans. In the UK and the United States increasing concern over DU’s health effects has led to the implementation of testing regimes for returning soldiers. In December 2007 the UN General Assembly passed, by an overwhelming majority, a resolution highlighting concerns over the military use of uranium. The resolution, entitled ‘Effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium’, urges UN member states to re-examine the health hazards posed by the use of uranium weapons. Growing evidence of uranium’s chemical toxicity and potentially carcinogenic nature dictates the application of the Precautionary Principle in line with EU law.
1. What steps is the Council taking or planning to take to follow up this European Parliament resolution?
2. How will the Council integrate the issue of uranium weapons into the European Security Strategy and Strategy on Weapons of Mass Destruction it has adopted?
3. What guarantees can the Council provide – in line with the precautionary principle and in the form of DU assessment in the context of each mission – that the use of uranium weapons will be avoided in ESDP missions, both on behalf, or under the auspices, of the EU and in cooperation with NATO and the US?
4. What measures can the Council take to ensure that ESDP personnel do not make contact with DU-contaminated objects or enter DU-contaminated quarters or areas?
5. What dialogue has the Council secretariat established on this issue with its US counterparts, Euromil, soldiers and civilians, for example in connection with operations in the Balkans and Iraq?
Questions to the Commission:
What measures is the Commission taking – in line with its obligations under the precautionary principle – to avoid exposure of its humanitarian personnel to DU in contaminated regions?
Does the Commission plan to open a dialogue with Euromil, which is in favour of a ban?
What funds does the Commission have available to make an inventory of contaminated areas, carry out an environmental investigation into the contaminated areas and assist in the cleaning up of contaminated areas?
What funds is the Commission ready to spend on information measures for civilians, aid workers and military personnel?
What funds does the Commission have available to provide medical investigations and health surveys of uranium victims and compensation for those victims? Oral questions to Council and Commission

Budget
EP Budget 2009: provisional estimates to be endorsed
2008-05-15 - 09:44
In a report on Parliament's estimates of revenues and expenditure for the 2009 financial year, MEPs in the Committee on Budgets endorse draft estimates and agree with the principle of establishing a "Lisbon reserve". The report by Janusz LEWANDOWSKI (EPP-ED, PL) endorses the draft estimates for the financial year 2009 as adopted by the Bureau on 21 April 2008, but underlines that "a more detailed examination of individual budget items should take place before the first reading of the budget in autumn".
MEPs in the committee state the 2009 budget should respond to a series of main challenges (already identified in the previous report by Mr Lewandowski and adopted in plenary on 10 April 2008), including:
Challenges related to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty ("Lisbon reserve" amounts of EUR 2 million -awaiting further evaluation);
Challenges related to 2009 as an election year for the Parliament;
Challenges related to the new Statute for Members and to the change of term.
The report stresses the fact that human resources were predominant questions at the pre-conciliation and "welcomes the fact that the bureau acted on concerns raised" by integrating the 65 Lisbon-related new posts (EUR 2 020 023 for 2009) and the changes to staff redeployment within and between DGs.
Parliamentary Assistants
The committee is also encouraged by the information that contacts have been made with Member States, the Council and the current and forthcoming Council Presidencies, concerning the new regime for parliamentary assistants. The committee recalls, in this respect, its guidelines and stresses once again the importance it attaches to resolving this issue.
In the report the overall level of the 2009 EP budget would stay below the traditional voluntary share of 20% and include a new Regime for parliamentary assistants, the new Member's Statute, financing the improvement of services to Members and a buildings policy.
