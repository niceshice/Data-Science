Parliament adopted a report demanding extra aid for the ACP countries hit by the overhaul of the Community sugar regime. MEPs in the committee wanted the EU to provide €80m in 2006, double the €40m proposed by the European Commission when it unveiled the reform in June this year. However, the final figure of €40 million was approved by Parliament in order to reach agreement with the Council in first reading.
Parliament's rapporteur Bernard Lehideux (ALDE, FR) therefore called for his name to be withdrawn from the report although reluctantly supporting the first-reading agreement on the €40 million.
The figure of €80m would come from the External action budget heading, a key area in the ongoing negotiations between Parliament and Council on the 2006 budget.
At the same time, the House urges ACP countries affected by the reform to promote non-food uses of sugar such as bioethanol production. And MEPs want the reform's flanking measures to be extended automatically to 2007 if negotiations on the next financial perspective drag on, thereby delaying implementation of the new instrument for development aid and economic cooperation.
