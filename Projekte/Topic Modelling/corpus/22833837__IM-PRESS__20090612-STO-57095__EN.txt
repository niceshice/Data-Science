Their first Parliamentary steps, Slovene Tanja Fajon (left) and Italian Lara Comi Pictured just outside the Parliament's Chamber Ms Comi called the space "open and dynamic" and Ms Fajon simply said it look "fantastic!" One of the first job´s is to have an official photo both for the online profile of Members but also for more mundane things like the purple ID badge required to get into the building! Newly arriving MEPs also need to register to be allocated an office as well as divulging other personal information normally associated with taking up a new job. Once registered they have to navigate their way through the large building to find their offices For Lara Comi this is her first taste of the Parliamentary Chamber where her reputation could be won or lost. Tanja Fajon, a long-time Brussels correspondent, is looking forward to being "on the side". On 14 July both MEPs will face their first test as the Constituent session of the Parliament opens in Strasbourg and the political debates start in earnest. This week the first newly elected MEPs started arriving at the EP. At the desk where they register we met Italian Lara Comi and Slovene Tanja Fajon who were taking their first steps in their 5-year term as MEPs. We went for a walk around the Parliament's buildings in Brussels as they acquainted themselves with their new surroundings and asked them a few questions about their new job.
Thirty-eight year old Socialist Tanja Fajon, a former correspondent of the Slovene TV told us that "living in such a diverse community as Europe means a challenge and privilege for me".
At just 26, Lara Comi of the centre-right EPP is believed to be the youngest Italian MEP and told us she is proud 60,000 people supported her. She said she regrets however that a busy political life will probably mean she will have to give up her favourite pastime - football. Have a read of what they both had to say.
TANJA FAJON
LARA COMI
First impressions?
I am not new to the Parliament. However, it is different to be on the other side. So far it is fantastic.
First time in Brussels?
No. I've lived in Brussels for almost 8 years.
What was your previous role?
For the last 7 and half years I have worked as correspondent for RTV Slovenia (Slovene national radio and TV station) in Brussels. I reported on the EU, NATO, Belgium, French, Netherland and Luxembourg.
In which areas would you like to put most efforts?
The lobbing for the parliamentary committees has just started. In my mind I have the Civil Liberties and Economics Affairs. But this does not mean that I will get what I want.
What picture will you hang first in your new office?
A picture that my Brussels friends and colleagues-journalists gave to me. It is a photo montage of photos of me with present European politicians.
Your favourite qualities in a politician?
To be able to listen, to choose what is important out of information overflow, to like talking with people, to be sociable, an adrenalin person, but to be able to find time for your own life as well.
First speech in the chamber - nervous, excited...?
I am not afraid of it. I have had many public speeches in front of a camera for many years. In fact I am looking forward to it and hope I will be able to say something very clever already in my first speech.
How would you make a mark here?
As a young, ambitious, hardworking and pleasant (in Slovenia "simpatična") person.
Your heroes in world history?
Leonardo DaVinci.
Your favourite motto?
To live in such a diverse community as Europe means a challenge and privilege for
me.
MEPs are very mobile. Are you used to travel a lot?
That's what I like most. I am used to be with one leg and a suitcase on the road.
Which languages do you speak?
English, French, German, Serbo-Croat. I also understand Italian and Spanish.
What is your favourite occupation when not working?
Sport. Running, dancing, scuba diving, skiing. I need to move! I am very much an adrenalin person. I also play piano.
Do you think you will still have time for it?
You can always find time if you organize yourself well. Until now I've been always good at that.
Do you have a good sense of direction? Are you afraid to get lost in the building?
I've never had a good sense of direction. On the road I use navigation system. Parliament's building I know quite well but it surprises me again and again how many new corridors are here. I guess I will be still getting lost!
First impressions?
Brussels is a truly European city. Here you can really feel an open and dynamic atmosphere.
First time in Brussels?
No. The second time. I visited EP as a regional coordinator for the young branch of 'Forza Italia' before.
What was your previous role?
I was brand manager for a big Italian toys company. As an MEP I will certainly keep my political activity at local level and maintain the connection with my constituency. I have to respond to over 60,000 people who choose me and defend their interests in Europe.
Into which area would you like to put most efforts?
Having the economic background I would like to follow Industry and International Trade.
What picture will you hang first in your new office?
A photo of me with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. He gave me the opportunity to run in these elections.
Your favourite qualities in a politician?
Concreteness and determination. You need to be frank and clear in your goals.
First speech in the plenary: nervous or excited?
Nervous for sure, but also proud to have the chance to represent Italy.
How would you make a mark here?
I would like to show that Italy is at the same level as Germany and France. That it is a modern country and is able to contribute to the political development of the EU. Being 26, I look at the long-term future of Europe!
Your heroes of the world history?
Two economists: Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes. Smith is more in theory -I don't think our system could really self-regulate. Keynes is more concrete and this is what we should apply.
MEPs are very mobile. Are you used to travel a lot?
Yes, I am used to it. I even live close to Milan airport!
Which language do you speak?
English and Spanish. I would love to learn French.
What is your favourite occupation when not working?
Cooking, as for any real Italian woman! And playing football.
Do you think you will still have time for it?
I think I will have to give up football, but I will definitely continue with cooking. I would love to cook for foreign colleagues, to help them discover Italian specialities!
Do you have a good sense of direction? Are you afraid to get lost in the building?
I walk around with a map of the Parliament. Although this morning I found immediately the meeting room!
