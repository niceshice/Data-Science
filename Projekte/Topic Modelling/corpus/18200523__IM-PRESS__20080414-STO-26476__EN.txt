MEPs explain their reactions to the press after visiting asylum centres
Living conditions and access to medical facilities in Danish asylum centres are very good, although there are concerns about how long people remain there. That was the conclusion of a visit by MEPs on the Civil Liberties Committee to the asylum and detention centres near Copenhagen on 10-11 April. Members thought the conditions compared favourably to those in other EU states although there was disquiet that some inmates had been there for up to eight years.
It was part of a series of fact finding missions MEPs are conducting across Europe to assess conditions in closed centres for immigrants and asylum seekers. Last Thursday, MEPs visited Sandholm Camp for asylum seekers, Ellebæk Detention Centre and Centre Kongelunden, all located in the Copenhagen area.
Following the visit, most of the delegation members agreed that the physical living conditions in the Danish centres were outstanding, comparing favourably with the situation observed in other European Union countries. Access to education and medical help within the centres was also highlighted: “The Red Cross is doing a terrific job in making the living conditions as normal as possible for the asylum seekers in the centres”, said Danish Socialist Britta Thomsen.
Some in centres for 8 years
The main concern raised by MEPs was the length of time that refused asylum seekers (who refuse to return their country of origin), spend in the centres without any certainty about their future. Some had stayed in the Sandholm centre for more than eight years, without being able to work or take part in life in the surrounding community.
Heading the delegation was Cypriot MEP Panayiotis Demetriou (EPP-ED). He told us that while other member states are facing serious problems with the physical living conditions in detention centres, at Sandholm the problem was different: “The problem for me is the length of time that these people have to stay in the centres, after the rejection of their application. It also has serious consequences for the parent’s ability in bringing up their children. When we are dealing with human beings, we have to be more flexible.”
Fears for social prospects of children
Parliament's rapporteur on the issue is French Socialist Martine Roure. She agreed that the main problem is the length of time refused asylum seekers stay inside the centres: “We are very concerned about the people who spend years and years, without the possibility to work – It’s also a way to create socially handicapped children.”
The delegation members expressed regret that they had not been able to meet the Danish Minister for Integration, Birthe Rønn Hornbech. "We would have liked to speak to the minister about the law, which apparently causes people to spend several years in the Danish asylum centres," Mr Demetriou said.
The aim of the EP missions is to check whether Community standards are being followed in EU states. So far, delegations from the Civil Liberties Committee have visited detention centres in Italy, Spain, France, Malta, Greece, Belgium, the UK, the Netherlands, Poland and now Denmark. Their next destination will be Cyprus.
In our next article on immigration we will take a closer look at the main problems that asylum seekers face in their daily lives.
