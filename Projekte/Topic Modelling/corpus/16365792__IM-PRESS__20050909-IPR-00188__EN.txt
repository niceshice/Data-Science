How can the EU and its Member States do more to combat poverty and social exclusion? The Women's Rights Committee gave its view on how to deal with this problem as it affects women in particular, when it adopted an own-initiative report by Anna Z치borsk치 (EPP-ED, SK) on Thursday.
Ms Z치borsk치's report looks at four main areas:
- the development of gender-based indicators and methodology, so as to measure the differing impact of poverty and social exclusion on women and men;
- the importance of involving poor women and families at all levels of decision-making;
- measures to improve the balance of family life and work in a disadvantaged environment;
- the contribution of civil society.
MEPs emphasise that "poverty has various manifestations" and that "new forms of poverty and marginalisation exist" . Poverty is not only about lack of income, it can also be related to ill-health, limited or non-existent access to education, unsafe environments and social discrimination and exclusion. A job is not in itself enough protection against extreme poverty. MEPs call on Member States to take targeted action to ensure that disadvantaged women have access to housing, public health and education. They also draw attention to serious consequences of poverty, stressing that extreme poverty situations are "conducive to trafficking in women, to prostitution and to violence" .
The committee argues that "extreme poverty is more prevalent among women" , saying that in seventeen of the Member States the risk of extreme poverty amongst women greatly exceeds the risk of extreme poverty amongst men. The majority of single-parent families, who run a greater risk of falling into poverty, are headed by a woman. A study of six EU Member States showed that female-headed households earn between 9% and 26% less than their male counterparts, the biggest disparity being in the UK (26%), followed by Sweden (14%), France (12%), the Netherlands (11%), Germany (10%) and Italy (9%). Moreover, the wage gap between men and women in Europe is still on average between 16% and 33%. More working women (30%) than men (6.6%) have a part-time job - a choice often forced upon women by a lack of affordable childcare facilities. In view of all this, MEPs call on the Member States to take practical steps to address pay differentials and promote working conditions that will enable both women and men to participate fully in the labour market.
The report is on the agenda for the plenary session of 12-13 October and thus gives the full Parliament a timely opportunity to discuss ways of tackling poverty a few days before World Day to Overcome Extreme Poverty (17 October).
