This Human Rights Conference and Sakharov Prize Network event provides a timely occasion to discuss the powerful role of new technologies in the battle for human rights.

The conference wants people engaged in the struggle for human rights around the World to look at Brussels as not only as the European Union's capital, but also as a human rights hub.The event will close with a public debate at the BOZAR Cultural Centre in the evening in Brussels.
