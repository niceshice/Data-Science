External Parliamentary Activities
President's diary. EP President Jerzy Buzek will be meeting Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy (Monday) and the President of the EU Committee of the Regions, Luc Van den Brande (Tuesday). He also has a meeting with Pavol Paška, the Speaker of the National Council (parliament) of Slovakia, which will be followed by a press point (Tuesday).
External activities. The week is otherwise set aside for MEPs to work in their constituencies or to make working visits as part of parliamentary delegations. There are therefore no official meetings of Parliamentary bodies scheduled in Brussels.
