The 2012 EU budget ©Belga/PhotoNonStop The European Parliament's October vote on next year's EU budget marked the beginning of the final stage of negotiations. With the agreement on the size and priorities of the 2012 budget, reached on the evening of 18 November, it took a concrete step towards a final agreement. The EP and Council agreed that the 2012 budget should rise 1.86%.
The so-called conciliation procedure, which runs 21 days and is the last stage in the process of adopting the yearly EU budget, began 1 November. The agreement reached got a final stamp of approval from the EP on 1 December and was then signed into law by EP President Jerzy Buzek.

2012 budget: MEPs' reactions to the package
MEPs voting the budget in plenary EP President Jerzy Buzek signed the 2012 budget 1 December, ending months of negotiations between the Parliament and the Council that ended in agreement on a budget of €129.1 billion for next year. While the budget is up slightly, in real terms it represents a drop in administration costs. So are MEPs satisfied? We spoke to representatives from six of the political groups who sit on the Budget Committee.
What would you like to have seen prioritised in the 2012 budget?
Jose Fernandes Costa a Portuguese member from the centre-right EPP: I believe that payment expenses should have been higher because the current multiannual framework for 2007-13 is coming to an end (payments for EU-programmes are traditionally higher towards the end of the long-term budget cycle). I predict the need for amending budgets to meet the expenses of the cohesion policies, such as the Cohesion Fund, ERDF and the European Social Fund.
Spanish Socialist Eider Rubial Gardiazábal: Aid to developing countries is underfinanced. Each year we have to ask for more money for the most urgent needs: Palestine, the new democracies in northern Africa, financing the Europe 2020-staregy. We also have to increase credits for programs like People, Lifelong learning, Erasmus-Mundus and EURES.
German Liberal Alexander Alvaro : We were able to shift some of the funds to EU-programmes benefiting growth and competitiveness, in line with the 2020 strategy. Where the EU can really provide added value in these difficult times is by fostering research and innovation.
French MEP and Green leader Daniel Cohn-Bendit: We need a restructuring of the budget. First of all we need a budget with "own resources", so we aren't dependent only on member state contributions, and we need to find the money for an ecological investment strategy at European level.
Miguel Portas a Portugese member of GUE/NGL : We presented concrete proposals to redeploy resources - which are now mobilised to multinationals - to enhance support to small and medium-sized enterprises and the more depressed European regions. We support programs for the integration of migrants and a policy against return policies. The governments of the EU are imposing a minimum budget for a minimal Europe.
Italian Claudio Morganti of EFD: As a group, we agreed on an EU budget, which is not too burdensome for citizens. Generally speaking, we are quite happy. In such a difficult period, we couldn't have asked for more. We are glad that SMEs and agriculture got the funds they need and we also strongly support the engagement on research and innovation. However, we regret the low quantity of funds allocated to Frontex (the EU's border agency).
Where would you have liked to have seen cuts?
Fernandes : I see no possibility of further cuts beyond those already made. It was a concerted effort by all the institutions on administrative and operational costs.
Gardiazábal: Parliament voted for some cuts, mainly in administrative expenses that have decreased in real terms. But the EU budget is essentially an investment budget. Making severe cuts means contracting member state economies and the European Socialists are against this way of reacting to the current crisis.
Alvaro : With a limited and balanced EU budget, intelligent budgeting is of the utmost importance. More money doesn't necessarily mean it is always spent wisely. The EP has managed to save some 74 million through cuts, internal reorganisation and redeployment. We could save much more if we only had one EP seat instead of the monthly travelling circus between Brussels and Strasbourg.
Portas : Appropriations for military and security research and programs such as Frontex...It is incomprehensible and unacceptable. The same can be said regarding several EU-programs supporting the export of commodities. These refunds are disastrous to developing countries' economies. Finally, savings and transparency improvements could still be made on the administrative expenditure of the EU institutions.
Morganti : We appreciated the cuts made at the administrative level, even if more considerable ones were possible, for example by reducing expenditures on the EP's three working places.
EU budget for 2012 approved by Parliament
EP president Jerzy Buzek, smiling as he signs budget Parliament endorsed the final size and priority spending areas of the 2012 EU budget, as agreed by its negotiating team and the EU Member States on 18 November, in a vote on Thursday.
Parliament's priorities adopted
In its proposals, the European Parliament had focussed on growth, innovation, employment, border control, migration management, and support of democratic development in the Arab world. These priorities were all taken on board by the Member States in the final deal.
Limited increase in payment appropriations
The increase in payment appropriations will be limited (1.86%) as requested by the Member States. The Commission, Council and Parliament agreed to take stock in the course of next year to see if the budget is realistic or if repairs are necessary. Member States signed a declaration to this end. The overall budget for next year will amount to €129.1 billion (1.86% increase) in payments and €147.2 billion (+3.8%) in commitments.
EP conciliation delegation chair Alain Lamassoure (EPP, FR) said: "In times of crisis we have managed to reduce operating costs while maintaining growth and competitiveness." He was nonetheless critical of the Council's preoccupation with the level of payments, whereas commitments were being disregarded. "We have to bring the two back in line to avoid having to discuss haircuts across the board every year", he said.
Mr Lamassoure thinks that the only way forward is to reduce Member States' contributions to the EU budget and replace them with own resources. "There will be no future financial framework without a political agreement on new resources", he said.
Parliament's rapporteur for most of next year's budget, Ms Francesca Balzani (S&D, IT) welcomed the adoption of Parliament's priorities by the Member States. But she also warned that the agreed level of payments might not be sufficient to pay all the bills next year.
The MEP who steered the administrative budgets through Parliament, José Manuel Fernandes (EPP, PT), said that the budget for administration - making up somewhat less than 6% of the total budget - "strikes the right balance between austerity and administrative needs". He underlined that administrative budgets for the different institutions were treated with rigour and will grow by around 1% only, which is a cut in real terms.
Budgets Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski welcomed the outcome of the negotiations and the self-restraint of the institutions in deciding their own budgets. However, he also warned that the agreed level of payments might be too low. "We have to reflect on our annual budget procedure, especially at the end of a multiannual financial framework. For now I trust the joint declaration signed by the Member States", he said
Nuclear Fusion Research (ITER)
The negotiated deal included an additional €100 million to finance the ITER nuclear fusion research programme in the south of France. A much greater amount will be needed to accommodate all the additional costs for this programme in future years. This will be further discussed in the Budgets Committee and with the Member States in "trailogue" meetings.
Amending the budget for 2011
Parliament also adopted an agreement on the additional financial needs for 2011. This was necessary as the Commission could no longer pay the bills in some policy areas. Apart from a reshuffle between budget lines, an additional €200 million will be added to the budget so that payments can again be made for Social Fund projects and research.
Another draft amending budget for 2011 will be voted in the Budgets Committee next week. It should meet the financial needs to cover EU Solidarity Fund aid totalling €38 million to Spain and Italy to repair damage caused by earthquakes in Lorca and flooding in the Veneto region.

Parliament, Council agree 2% increase for 2012 budget
People at work on the site of the future International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) ©BELGA_AFP_B.HORVAT The EU budget will rise by a little less than 2% in 2012 according to an agreement reached by the European Parliament and member states on Friday night. The overall budget for next year will be €129.1 billion (up 1.86%) in payments and €147.2 in commitments.
French EPP member Alain Lamassoure , who chaired the EP delegation in the conciliation committee said, "This budget shows that the EU institutions, in difficult times, are ready to agree on a budget combining budgetary discipline and investing in future growth."
Combines discipline, investment in future
The increase in the budget has been limited in line with demands by EU countries, but the European Commission, Council and EP agreed to take stock in the course of next year to see if the budget is realistic or if adjustments are needed.
The EP's priorities of growth, innovation, employment, border control, migration management and support of democratic development in the Arab world were taken on board.
"We were very selective with our priorities and I am glad they were accepted by the Council," said Italian Socialist Francesca Balzani , who guided most of the budget proposals through the EP. "This is the first budget in real support of the EU2020 strategy for growth and innovation. It means more money for research, better job qualifications and a competitive Europe."
"Real" cut in institutions' budget
Portuguese Christian Democrat José Manuel Fernandes steered the administrative budgets through Parliament and said that at somewhat less than 6% of the total the administrative budget "strikes the right balance between austerity and administrative needs". He said that in real terms the administrative budgets for the different institutions would grow only around 1%, which is a cut in real terms
An additional €100 million was agreed to finance the nuclear fusion research programme ITER in the south of France.
There was also an accord on additional finance for 2011 , as the EU has run out of funds in some policy areas. An additional €200 million will be added to the budget for social fund projects and research.
The agreement still has to be approved by the whole EP and by Council. Press release following agreement
Conciliation: the final stage to smooth over differences
The conciliation procedure began 1 November ©Belga/Xinhua Opinions on the appropriate level of EU spending at a time of austerity remained divided as MEPs and representatives of the Council on the Conciliation Committee met on 8 November in a bid to adopt the next year's budget by early December.
The EP thinks the EU needs a budget of €133.1 billion in 2012, up 5.2% from 2011. In money terms this is €4.06 billion more than the Council wants. EU countries are keen to keep the budget as low as possible, while Parliament is more in line with European Commission estimates of how much is needed to pay all the bills next year. The Commission says a 4.9% increase is necessary. These differences will be key in the negotiations during the conciliation procedure.
Of course budget talks are not only about amounts but also about political priorities. Parliament wants to add funds for Palestine and to increase spending on projects that stimulate investment, growth and employment. Member states on the other hand want to use a large share of research funding for the ITER nuclear fusion project in the South of France.
Conciliation is the culmination of the budget adoption process that starts each year in April when the Commission presents the draft budget. By October, both the Parliament and the Council have decided their stance and the negotiations start.
How does conciliation work?
a Conciliation Committee is set up, composed of 27 members of the Council or their representatives and an equal number of MEPs (meetings are scheduled 8 and 18 November)
trilogue talks between the Council, Parliament and Commission run in parallel (meetings 3 and 14 November)
the Conciliation Committee has 21 days to come up with a deal; if there is no agreement, the Commission has to come up with a new draft budget
if a deal is agreed, the EP and Council have 14 days to approve or reject it
The EP can adopt the budget even if the Council rejects the joint text.
if Council and Parliament reject the joint draft, the budget is rejected and the Commission has to submit a new draft budget
If everything goes according to the plan, the EP will vote on a joint text during the 30 November - 1 December plenary in Brussels, but a vote could also take place during the 12-15 December plenary in Strasbourg. Budget procedure - Commission Treaty rules on the budget
EU budget: boosting growth and employment
A 2012 budget for growth and employment ©Belga/Photoshot The EP thinks the EU needs a 2012 budget of € 133.1 billion to fulfill its priorities and meet its legal obligations, € 4.06 billion more than EU countries are willing to spend. In a vote 26 October, MEPs demanded significant increases in R&D investment and regional policy spending, saying that the EU budget needs to support economic recovery. The EP also goes well beyond the council's stance regarding activities outside the EU, like Palestine, Asia and Latin America. There are five broad categories of EU spending outlined below.
Sustainable growth (headings 1a and 1b): R&D, education and training, trans-European networks (railways, highways); supporting development of least developed EU countries and regions, inter-regional cooperation.
Agriculture and environment (heading 2): common agricultural policy, common fisheries policy, rural development and environmental measures
Freedom, security, justice and citizenship (3a and 3b): justice and home affairs, border protection, immigration and asylum policy, public health, consumer protection, culture, youth, information and dialogue with citizens
Foreign affairs (heading 4): all EU "foreign policy"
Administration (heading 5): covers the administrative expenditure of all the European institutions, including salaries, rent of buildings, pensions etc Table of Council and Parliament positions on the 2012 budget Multimedia - EU budget at glance
Parliament votes growth-stimulating budget for 2012
EP voted a budget for growth, employment and innovation in the Union ©European Union Parliament aimed for a 2012 budget for growth, employment and innovation in the Union and for supporting development and democracy in neighbouring countries, when it voted its position on next year's budget on Wednesday.
In general, MEPs sought to restore the draft budget proposed by the Commission, which the Council cut in July. Parliament's position implies an increase in payments of 5.2% as compared to this year's budget, resulting in a budget of €133.1 billion. The budget resolution was adopted with 431 votes in favour, 120 against and 124 abstentions.
A 21-day conciliation period starts in November, with meetings foreseen on 8 and 18 November. Furthermore, there are budget trilogues foreseen on 3, 10 and 14 November. If Parliament and Council can agree, the final budget could be approved at the December I session in Brussels.
Investments in R&D, cohesion and structural funds on track
The spending categories that see the biggest increases in payments are Research and Development (+10.35%) and Cohesion and Structural funds (+8.8%). This is because these policies in fact consist of long-term investment projects which now, in the fifth year of the current multiannual financial framework (MFF), are up to full speed and for which money committed earlier now needs to be paid out.
Another category that sees a significant increase is Freedom, Security and Justice (+6.84%), due to growing needs to manage refugee and migration flows and step up maritime surveillance in the Mediterranean.
By contrast, in category 1A, "Competitiveness for growth and employment" and category 4, "the EU as a global player", Parliament wants to spend only slightly more than the Commission originally proposed.
Several MEPs criticised the Council for inconsistencies in its position on the Commission's Draft Budget. The budgets for the new European financial supervision bodies and Frontex are deemed insufficient for them to function properly, whereas their work is considered a top priority.
Research, innovation and education (heading 1A)
Ms Francesca Balzani (S&D, IT), who is steering the budget through Parliament, stressed that investments are needed to secure future growth and employment. Parliament followed her proposals to increase spending on programmes related to the EU2020 strategy
Parliament does not agree to funding the EU's nuclear fusion programme ITER with money allocated for R&D under the 7th Research and Development Framework Programme, as the Commission and Council propose. As the idea for this mega-project was mooted during the current MFF period, MEPs feel it should be financed with fresh money, and not by funding taken from other research projects.
Cohesion policy (heading 1B)
On the policy for greater cohesion between the EU's regions, MEPs restored the Commission's draft budget proposal, which Member States had sought to cut.
Agriculture and environment (heading 2)
Parliament agreed to add €250 million to emergency funds for fruit and vegetable producers. This money is meant to prevent future crises such as last year's EHEC-bacteria one and to compensate farmers for the financial consequences of further crises.
MEPs strongly defended the EU's "food-for-the-needy" scheme, which provides food to food banks, for which Council is blocking a new legal basis.
Freedom, security, justice and citizenship (headings 3a and 3b)
Parliament disagreed with cuts proposed by the Council on the EU Refugee Fund, Return Fund and External Border Fund (€45 million). The budget for the EU border agency Frontex should be increased by a reserve of €25 million, they said, because this money might be needed for maritime border controls in the Mediterranean and for stepping up surveillance at the Greek-Turkish border. Just last month extra money was added to the 2011 budget for these purposes and MEPs feel that matters may not improve by the end of the year.
Foreign affairs (heading 4)
MEPs approved an increase of €100 million in aid to Palestine, the Middle East Peace process and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). They also approved €27 million for the development co-operation instrument for Asia and Latin America, and added €3 million for election observation missions and €3 million for the Turkish-Cypriot Community. To fund this, MEPs cut other lines, such as the EU Police Mission in Afghanistan and the line for emergency measures under the common foreign and security policy (CFSP).
Administration (heading 5)
The rapporteur for the EP budget and those of the other institutions, Mr José Manuel Fernandes (EPP, PT) proposed further cuts to Parliament's budget. Parliament opted for a below-inflation increase of 1.44%, while doing significantly more with the money. The proposal now includes the accommodation of 18 extra MEPs as a result of the Lisbon Treaty. If these costs were excluded, the increase would amount to only 0.8%. To bring the expenses down, MEPs intend to save money on translation and interpretation, by making organizational changes, and voted for a 5% cut in travel expenses, for example by reducing the number of business flights. All allowances will be frozen at 2011 levels.

Balzani: 2012 budget should be development-oriented
Francesca Balzani Wednesday's vote on the EU 2012 budget marks the beginning of the last phase of the budget negotiations between the Parliament and member states. Italian Socialist Francesca Balzani, one of the draftsmen of the EP's position on the budget, says it should promote growth and the creation of high-quality jobs in line with the EU's 2020 strategy. The Council should finance the latter in a proper way, despite calls for austerity, she says.
What is the main point of contention between the EP and Council?
The promotion of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy, which creates growth and high-quality employment by delivering on the Europe 2020 strategy goals has been endorsed by all 27 member states and the EU institutions, but while the Council recognises its importance, because of austerity constraints, it is not prepared to finance the EU2020 strategy in a proper way.
The EU 2020 strategy aims to establish the conditions for economic recovery. The EP believes that investments must be made now and not delayed any further. We think some actions are underfunded and are asking for implementation of the strategy to be speeded up.
How far apart are the Council and EP? How many billions are we talking about?
The difference between the EP's position and Council's position is €1.5 billion in commitments and €4 billion in payments. The EP is talking about €147.766 billion in commitments and €133.143 billion in payments, while the Council wants to limit commitments to €146.254 billion and payments to €129.088 billion.
In July the Council went for a budget freeze, allowing only increases in line with inflation. Does the EP think increases are warranted at times of austerity?
The EU budget for each year is a part of a 7-year financial framework which estimates how much money EU programmes will need. The EP's proposal for next year's budget addresses the need to respect existing commitments and to speed up programmes that are running out. The EP thinks inflation is not a good benchmark, especially not two years before the end of the financial framework.
The EU's role increased under the Lisbon Treaty, but it seems member states want more done with less money. Are there enough of reserves to manage that?
Great efforts will be needed from all institutions to save money as well as the redistribution of money from old to new actions. Nevertheless, the EP will try to secure financing for the priorities of the 2020 Strategy for more and better jobs in EU. Article following committee vote (6 October)
Budgets Committee in "balancing act" to jumpstart EU growth
Parliament's Budgets committee finalised its position on the 2012 EU budget ©BELGA_KEYSTONE_Martin Ruetschi MEPs voted to boost EU 2012 spending by €30 million to support growth investments on Wednesday. The Committee's decision is an attempt to prevent Europe from slipping further into a crisis, as Italian MEP Francesca Balzani warned that the EU's "2020" growth strategy should not fall victim to the current austerity climate. At the same time, Members made cuts of €26 million in administration and foreign policy expenses.
MEPs in the European Parliament's Budgets committee were considering the EU's draft 2012 annual budget proposed by the Commission, following amendments made to it by Europe's 27 finance ministers meeting in the Council.
Seeking to add value at the European level
MEPs rejected cuts made by Council to financing for development in Europe's poorest countries, restoring the levels of "cohesion" expenditure originally proposed by the Commission.
They also voted to add €250 million in the agricultural budget for fruit and vegetable producers to prevent future crises such as last year's EHEC-bacteria food safety scare.
In the domain of external relations, though overall cuts were made, €100 million more was set aside for aid to Palestine, while Frontex, the EU's border agency, was allocated €25 million more than in the draft budget received from Council.
In the context of the current economic crisis and high indebtedness of EU countries, budget commissioner Janusz Lewandowski described the draft budget under consideration as a "delicate balancing act combining austerity and growth boosting measures".
Parliament's position in negotiations with the Council…
In June this year, MEPs already defended an increase in payment appropriations (money actually paid out in a given year on the basis of prior commitments) of 4.9% over 2011 for the next financial year, challenging EU Member States to explain publicly which of the EU's political priorities or projects they would otherwise be prepared to delay or drop altogether.
… and Council's
On 25th July, the Council opted for a freeze on the budget in real terms, thus allowing for an increase in payments of just 2.02% over 2011 (€129.1 billion), with inflation forecast at 2%. According to the Council, its position "takes due account of the member states' fiscal consolidation efforts whilst allowing the financing of the EU priorities".
Next steps
The Budgets Committee will vote on a draft budget resolution next week, explaining why its figures were adopted. Parliament will then vote its position at the 26 October plenary session. A 21-day conciliation period starts in November. If Parliament and Council can agree, the final budget could be approved by the end of November.
