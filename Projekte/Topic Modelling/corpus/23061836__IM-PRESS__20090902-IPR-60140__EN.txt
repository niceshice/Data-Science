The Directive on working time for road transport workers is further delayed amid disagreement between MEPs from the Employment Committee on whether to apply the rules to self-employed drivers.
The European Parliament's Employment Committee decided Wednesday to refer a vote on the proposal by the Commission for a new directive on working time for road transport workers, to its next meeting on 29/09 in Brussels.
The European Parliament had come to a position in plenary in May when it adopted a report rejecting the Commission's proposal to exclude self-employed drivers from the scope of the directive.
On 29/09, if committee MEPs adopt Edit BAUER's (EPP, Hungary) report on the Commission's proposed Directive, the European Parliament's plenary position will be considered confirmed. If Mrs Bauer's report is rejected, a new report will be drafted and the debate reopened in committee.
