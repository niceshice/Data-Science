Donald Tusk at the European Parliament
Marking an apparent warming of Poland’s attitude to the EU, new Prime Minister Donald Tusk was at the European Parliament on Tuesday in only his second foreign visit. Mr Tusk said ratification of the new Reform Treaty was of the “utmost priority”, although Poland will keep its opt-out on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
He met with Parliament’s President Hans-Gert Pöttering and leaders of Parliament’s political groups during his visit. Mr Pöttering paid tribute to “the strong will of the Polish people for democracy and freedom” that had helped bring such changes to the continent in the 1980s and marked the contribution of Lech Walesa and Pope John Paul II.
“Positive tension”
In one of his first speeches as Prime Minister Mr Tusk outlined his views on the European Union saying that “there should be no distinction between Poland and the EU. Poland is a strong part of the EU’s political and moral basis for unification".
Mr Tusk said during his visit that in the EU there may be “differences” and “problems” but that “problems are there to be solved”. He went on to say that “differences of interests and positions can be the source of positive tension and not conflict".
Asked by a journalist about the Polish opt-out on the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, Mr Tusk said he personally advocates full ratification of the Charter. However, the Polish Cabinet has decided to retain it because of concerns its inclusion could block ratification of the Reform Treaty in the Polish Parliament. He reiterated that ratification of the Treaty was of the “utmost priority” for his government.
In a recent resolution the EP urged Poland and the UK to fully implement the Charter as soon as possible.
