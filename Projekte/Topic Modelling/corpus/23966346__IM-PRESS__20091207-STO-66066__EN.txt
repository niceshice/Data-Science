Soon gone Climate change has already had a serious impact on some countries. Tuvalu is one of them. If nothing is done, this country of several islands in the Pacific Ocean, is likely to disappear as the sea level rises. Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia, was in Parliament Thursday and spoke to us about his hopes that the Copenhagen summit will get an agreement on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
What consequences has climate change had in your country?
Our islands are tiny and they are being eroded by the rising sea level and climate change. There are a lot of the cyclones and strong winds during the last few years. There are strong, big waves going into the land and they've been leaving a lot of salt in the soil. They are reaching places they never have before and have killed vegetation, trees, crops and gardens.
What is the worst case scenario for the future?
Our islands could be submerged. If we get a tsunami, a wave big enough to go over the land, because we are low lying islands, we are very tiny, very narrow, only about a mile or so in some places. If a wave comes it will go right across the whole island, that is the worst-case scenario. People will die, they will drown and all the properties will be damaged.
What do you expect from the climate change conference in Copenhagen and from the EU?
I expect a legally-binding agreement to be signed. I am going there to sign it and I want all the leaders to do the same. So, I am asking the EU, all the countries in the EU, to work with Tuvalu to make sure that there is a legally binding agreement to be signed.
That is why I am here, that is why I am talking to them. I am trying to tell them that they have to work with me, and with all vulnerable countries, the countries most at risk from climate change.
