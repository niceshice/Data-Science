Aiming for a greener European Parliament

A special geothermic heater used in the Parliament's building in Strasbourg. With 736 elected Members and almost 6,000 staff spread in 27 different countries, the European Parliament faces enormous challenges to meet its own self-stated aim of cutting its carbon footprint by 30% by 2020. To do this an Eco-Management and Audit scheme (EMAS) has been put in place to try and cut emissions. One step forward has been that since last year the Parliament has decided to use only electricity generated from renewable sources.
Added to the problem is that the Parliament also has to travel - with Plenary sessions in Strasbourg and Committee meetings in Brussels. The introduction of a train service last year to replace the previous charter flights has been one step in reducing the carbon footprint.
In addition to this new buildings in Brussels have been packed with eco-technologies to reduce their impact. A planned new office building in Luxembourg will use geothermic energy, solar and photovoltaic panels to generate electricity, bio fuels as well as fuel cells.
Cutting down on wasted energy in people's office
The EMAS scheme has tried to concentrate on day-to-day offices practices like excessive printing and leaving computers on overnight. By printing on both sides of the paper and introducing a system that automatically shuts down computers a lot of wasted energy has been saved.
In terms of political work less travel by employees and more use of video conferencing have been two ways that the carbon footprint is being addressed. In addition to this green clauses have been built into public procurement contracts that the Parliament concludes.
Green week highlights issues
Nevertheless, there is a realistic understanding that more steps need to be taken so substantial carbon cuts can be made. These include looking at the heating and air conditioning systems as well as improving insulation to prevent heat loss. Changing the Parliament's vehicles over to hybrid ones could also be another step.
From today a series of events will be held in the European Parliament in Brussels less as part of the annual "Green week" (24 June - 15 July) aimed at raising awareness of eco-issues and promoting change. These include ways of measuring how much electricity different appliances likes lights and household appliance use. There will also be an exhibition on climate change in the Arctic.
