Institutions
Plenary sittings
2010-12-13 - 18:14
The completion of the 2011 budget procedure, a debate on the Cancún climate summit and this year's Sakharov Prize award to Guillermo Fariñas were among the topics on this week's agenda highlighted by Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek as he opened the last Strasbourg session of 2010. Mr Buzek also paid tribute to those who lost their lives under martial law in Poland 29 years ago.
The President first highlighted Parliament's debate on the 2011 budget on Tuesday, with the vote following on Wednesday. He also drew attention to Tuesday afternoon's debate on the Cancún climate change summit, pointing out that a sizeable delegation of MEPs had attended the summit.
Turning to the week's other highlight, the President said "On October 21 Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas was chosen as the winner of this year's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. Regrettably, Mr Fariñas is experiencing problems leaving the country, even though I made a personal appeal in a letter to the President of Cuba, Mr Raul Castro. We expect that Lady Ashton will take due note of these problems and that she will take this into account in future relations with Cuba. If Guillermo Fariñas were to leave in the next few hours, he could still be here in time to receive his prize".
Mr Buzek then reminded the House that 29 years ago, on 13 December 1981, martial law was imposed on Poland. Thousands were arrested and around 100 people killed. "We pay tribute to those who gave their lives to save Europe from the communist yoke", he said.
Lastly, the President announced that following his behaviour in the plenary chamber on 24 November for which he had made no apology, Godfrey Bloom (EFD, UK) would, in accordance with Parliament's rules, lose seven days' worth of parliamentary allowances.
Agenda changes
The House approved two additions to the agenda. At the request of the EPP group, the report by József Szájer on the Commission's exercise of implementing powers: rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States, will be debated on Wednesday and put to the vote on Thursday. At the request of the S&D group, oral questions to Council and Commission on economic governance and Article 9 of the Lisbon Treaty will be debated on Wednesday afternoon.
