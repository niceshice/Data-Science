In the heartland: A town hall meeting in Grenoble, South East France, during the Euro elections This is a "turquoise" week in Parliamentâ€™s calendar, a time when the focus turns outwards and MEPs traditionally leave Brussels and Strasbourg and devote time to constituency matters. There is no formal political activity at the European Parliament itself.
During the four turquoise weeks in 2009, MEPs have the opportunity to concentrate on their constituencies and meet the electorate at home, or take part in official delegations to maintain and develop the Parliament's international contacts.
Last week the new delegations were formed in Strasbourg. Currently 40, they offer the EP a vital network of contacts and a forum for dialogue with parliamentarians in partner countries outside the EU.
