Citizens' forums test the political water this Autumn
Do you have an opinion of where the EU should be heading in future? Well now is your chance to have your say as the European Parliament's "Citizens' forums" discussion groups continue around the EU. Seven countries will host them throughout November and December, presenting an opportunity for the public and their elected representatives to discuss what they would like the EU to be doing for them.
This initiative is the Parliament's contribution to the "period of reflection" called after Dutch and French voters said "No" to the proposed EU constitution. MEPs and national politicians now go local to meet the citizens and hear their ideas and concerns on the future direction of the European Union. A successful spring of discussions took in Germany, Greece, Finland, France, Poland and Sweden. Autumn will now feature the Czech Republic, Italy, France, Portugal and Slovenia.
Some of the issues already discussed include: How long will EU border restrictions remain? What change will the Euro currency bring? Can we work and study in other EU countries? Also considered have been ways of increasing cooperation between border regions in different countries.
Don't miss the opportunity to be involved if they are near you. The schedule for November and December is:
