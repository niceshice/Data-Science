Briefing - 18-21 June 2007 - Strasbourg
2007-06-14 - 09:28
The June plenary session in Strasbourg sees the House debating and voting on the final report on the Crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. The EP debates the definition and labelling of sprit drinks including vodka and whisky. The House will also debate a call to ban the imports of cat and dog fur. MEPs will also tackle the issue of improving the portability of supplementary pension rights.
Monday 18 June 2007
MEPs will debate a first-reading legislative report on the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks . Parliament will vote on controversial new rules on the production and labelling of spirits such as whisky and vodka when a first-reading report from the Environment Committee comes before the plenary. A compromise text has just been agreed with Council covering all the main issues including the most hotly-contested one: the ingredients and labelling of vodka .
Later on Monday, the House will debate banning the import of or export from the Community of cat and dog fur . The first-reading report being tabled by the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee would scrap an exemption allowing trade in fur from cats and dogs if they were "not bred or killed for fur production". MEPs fear this would leave a "gaping loophole" in the legislation, which traders would quickly exploit.
The last item on Monday evening will see MEPs debate the topic of multiple sclerosis . Marcin Libicki (UEN, PL) on behalf of the Committee on Petitions will be asking the Commission to indicate the specific measures which it has taken to implement this resolution and, in particular, the Code of Best Practice.
On the sidelines of the plenary, the Transport Committee will vote on a key legislative report on the accomplishment of the internal market of postal services. There will be a technical briefing on the proposed directive at 10.30am in the European Parliament press room in Brussels (PHS A050).
Tuesday 19 June 2007
Parliament will debate and vote on the final report by the Committee of Inquiry into the Crisis at the Equitable Life Assurance Society . The House is expected to endorse the inquiry's findings, which include recommendations aimed at preventing such cases in future and at fostering a healthy European pensions and insurance market. The report also calls on the UK government to set up a compensation scheme for Equitable's victims.
Later on Tuesday, Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK) will present her report on public procurement legislation . The committee recommends that the Commission propose an action plan to encourage Member States to fulfil their obligation to tackle persistent and emerging transposition and implementation problems in public procurement, focusing on illegal direct awards and late or incorrect transposition.
The House will also debate and vote on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury . The Environment Committee is tabling a report calling for a proposed ban on exports of mercury to be brought forward to 1 December 2010. It also wants stricter rules on storage of this substance, which is regarded as dangerous to health and the environment. In addition, it is proposing that an import ban be introduced from 1 July 2010, something which was not included in the Commission's draft legislation.
MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on the recent developments on the financing of Galileo - the EU's satellite navigation system. MEPs in the Budgets Committee urge the Commission to come up with a revised proposal for a regulation for the financing of the EU satellite navigation system. The funding proposal should be made under the co-decision procedure, the resolution says.
On Tuesday afternoon, Glenys Kinnock (PES, UK) will present her report on the Millennium Development Goals at the Midway Point . The report commends the Member States that have reached or exceeded the 0.7% Overseas Development Aid (ODA) / GNI target and those that are increasing their actual aid levels, but regrets that some EU-15 countries have missed the interim 0.33% target by a large margin in 2006.
Later, the House will debate the outcome of the recent G8 meeting held in Heiligendamm, Germany after hearing statements from the Council and the Commission.
The House will also debate and vote on the recent Petitions Committee fact-finding mission to Andalucía, Valencia and Madrid concerning the extensive urbanisation projects in these autonomous regions of Spain about which many petitions have been received.
Wednesday 20 June 2007
The key debate of the week is the debate at first-reading on the improvement of the portability of supplementary pension rights . Parliament's Employment and Social Affairs Committee, in a first-reading report by Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP-ED, NL), broadly endorses the Commission proposal but spells out the point that the directive should apply to all supplementary pension schemes for workers, e.g. group insurance contracts, pay-as-you-go schemes, funded schemes or pensions backed by book reserves.
The House will then debate the enlargement of the eurozone to Malta and Cyprus from 1 January 2008.
On Wednesday afternoon, the House will debate a report on MEDA and financial support to Palestine - evaluation, implementation and control.
The rest of the afternoon is dedicated to a series of reports from the Civil Liberties Committee. Among them is a report from Martine Roure (PES, FR) on the framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia . On 20 April 2007, the Council of EU Justice Ministers in Luxembourg achieved political agreement, the Parliament will give its views on this.
Thursday 2 1 June 2007
On Thursday, the Internal Market Committee will be putting forward a legislative report on review procedures concerning the award of contracts . The directive amends the “Remedies Directives”, the European Commission is seeking to improve economic operators’ recourse to effective and harmonised procedures in cases of illegally awarded public procurement award contracts.
The House will also vote on a resolution on the situation on the Middle East following the debate held with Javier Solana in Brussels on 6 June 2007.

European Parliament to vote on findings of Equitable Life inquiry
2007-06-14 - 09:28
On 19 June Parliament will debate and vote on the final report by the committee of inquiry into the crisis at the Equitable Life Assurance Society. The House is expected to endorse the inquiry's findings, which include recommendations aimed at preventing such cases in future and at fostering a healthy European pensions and insurance market. The report also calls on the UK government to set up a compensation scheme for Equitable's victims. The report - drafted by Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK) - was approved on 8 May in committee by 13 votes to 0 with 4 abstentions. No further amendments can be tabled: the plenary can only endorse or reject the committee’s text. Commissioner Charlie McCREEVY , who is responsible for single market legislation, will take part in the plenary debate.
The inquiry was set up in January 2006 in response to two petitions received by Parliament from policyholders who were among the victims of the debacle at Equitable Life that inflicted major financial losses on over a million people, mainly in Britain but also in other countries, including Ireland and Germany. The problems arose because of mismanagement by the company: it did not set aside adequate reserves to cover its liabilities and then ran into financial difficulties when interest rates began to fall in the 1990s.
The EP committee could only investigate the EU-related aspects of the case. The committee has been looking into the role of UK government and regulators in implementing EU insurance law and that of the European Commission in monitoring the implementation of such law. The spotlight has been on two key issues: the plight of the policyholders and the implications for the European single market in financial services .
Poor implementation of EU law and weakness of financial regulators
The committee concludes that EU life insurance legislation was transposed into British law in an unsatisfactory fashion (this raises the general question of how well EU law is transposed in all the different Member States and how far this process is monitored by the Commission). In addition, the UK's financial services regulators are severely criticised, notably for their “excessive leniency” towards Equitable Life’s solvency margin (its inadequate reserves).
Difficulty in obtaining redress, both inside and outside the UK
When Equitable policyholders (most based in the UK) sought to defend their rights, they “had great difficulty in knowing what route to take or who to apply to in trying to obtain information, make a complaint and obtain redress", whether through the courts, through alternative dispute schemes or through ombudsman services. Non-UK policyholders, such as the 8,000 in Ireland and 4,000 Germany, suffered from a further problem: which regulatory bodies were responsible? Was it those in the “home state” (the company’s country of origin) or the “host state” (the country where it sold its policies)? The EP inquiry concludes that this was not clear.
Recommendations of the inquiry
Following up on its conclusions, the inquiry makes a number of proposals. Regarding the victims of the crisis, MEPs believe that "the UK Government is under an obligation to assume responsibility" and should therefore devise an appropriate scheme "with a view to compensating Equitable Life policyholders within the UK, Ireland, Germany and elsewhere".
Turning to the 'lessons for the future', the report stresses as a general point "the need to foster consumer confidence in pension products" (especially given Europe's ageing population and hence the growing importance of pensions). It requests that "any financial services legislation duly recognises the priority of consumer and investor protection issues", while still minimising red tape and not stifling innovation in the financial services industry.
More specifically, it calls for stricter rules on insurance supervision and regulation throughout the EU, for Member States and the Commission to improve the transposition and monitoring of EU legislation and for national regulatory authorities to cooperate better.
The European Commission, according to the report, did not monitor the application of the EU insurance legislation effectively, and should in future be “more proactive” on this front "to ensure that the legislation is producing the required effects".
The inquiry also suggests that the European Parliament's standing committees should play a more active role in following up the implementation of legislation in their own policy areas.
Strengthening the role of committees of inquiry
Committees of inquiry, as provided for in the Maastricht Treaty, allow the European Parliament to investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law. Parliament has set up only two previous inquiries under this procedure, both completed in 1997. The first investigated the Community transit system and the second the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis.
However, witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence and in the present case some did not do so. The committee report "expresses irritation and regret at the discourteous conduct of several witnesses who did not cooperate with the Inquiry" and MEPs therefore call for broader powers for EP committees of inquiry, notably regarding the summoning of witnesses and cooperation by Member States' authorities.

Multiple Sclerosis - Code of Best Practice
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Marcin LIBICKI (UEN, PL), on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, will be asking the Commission the following questions on Multiple Sclerosis Code of Best Practice. In November 2003, the EP adopted a report on a petition on Petition 842/2001 concerning the effects of discriminatory treatment afforded to persons with multiple sclerosis within the European Union. On the basis of the resolution and in cooperation with Multiple Sclerosis Societies in the Member States and the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform, a Code of Best Practice has been prepared and submitted to the EU institutions.
Would the Commission indicate the specific measures which it has taken to implement this resolution and, in particular, the Code of Best Practice? Oral question to the Commission

Fact-finding mission to the regions of Andalusia, Valencia and Madrid - has urbanisation gone too far?
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Marcin LIBICKI (UEN, PL) and Michael CASHMAN (PSE, UK), on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, will be asking the Commission and the Counci questions on their recent fact-finding mission to the regions of Andalusia, Valencia and Madrid. On 11 April, the Petitions Committee approved a report (see link) which resulted from a fact-finding mission to the regions of Andalusia, Valencia and Madrid concerning the extensive urbanisation projects in these autonomous regions of Spain about which many petitions have been received.
The report was strongly critical of the fact that the basic rights of thousands of European citizens to their legitimately acquired property are being severely undermined by these massive urban development programmes. Furthermore, due to lack of transparent procedures, European directives on public procurement are not complied with, water supply and compliance with European directives on water management are threatened, and the directives on the protection of the environment and biodiversity are frequently being ignored. Parliament itself approved a resolution on this issue on 13 December 2005 by an overwhelming majority, concerning the Valencian region where the most serious cases are occurring. Both the report of the fact-finding visit and the resolution of Parliament have been transmitted to the Council Presidency and the European Commission.
What actions are being taken by the Commission / Council Presidency to ensure the correct application of Community law and respect for the fundamental rights of European citizens, as contained in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union?

MEPs to call for a complete ban on the cat and dog fur trade in the EU
2007-06-14 - 09:28
The House will debate and vote in Strasbourg on a proposed EU-wide ban on trading in cat and dog fur. The first-reading report being tabled by the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee would scrap an exemption allowing trade in fur from cats and dogs if they were "not bred or killed for fur production". MEPs fear this would leave a "gaping loophole" in the legislation, which traders would quickly exploit. In December 2003, Parliament adopted a declaration calling on the European Commission to draft a regulation banning the import, export, sale and production of cat and dog fur and skins. Three years later – after a public outcry over evidence that cat and dog fur products were still entering the EU, despite a voluntary code of conduct adopted by European fur traders – Parliament got its wish.
“The placing on the market and the import to or export from the Community of fur of cats and dogs and products containing such fur shall be prohibited”, stipulates Article 1 of the draft regulation proposed by the Commission. The committee backed this element of the legislation by a large majority.
However, they did not back a derogation proposed by the Commission to the ban, which would open up the possibility for cat and dog fur to be placed on the EU market provided that the fur (or products containing it) were (a) “labelled as originating from cats or dogs that have not been bred or killed for fur production”, or (b) constituted “personal or household effects” introduced into, or exported from, the Community.
Rapporteur Eva-Britt SVENSSON (GUE/NGL, SE) was adamant about doing away with the derogation, saying that it “would provide a gaping loophole, which would be ruthlessly exploited by traders of all future consignments of cat and dog fur, thus rendering the entire regulation useless”. Fellow MEPs agreed, voting to delete the relevant article, and committee chair Arlene McCARTHY (PES, UK) echoed their views, saying “We want a ban, not a restriction”.
In the course of negotiations with the Council, MEPs did agree, however, that, "by way of exceptional derogation", the Commission may adopt provisions allowing cat and dog fur on the EU market "for educational or taxidermy purposes."
By entering into negotiations with the Council Presidency ahead of the plenary vote, MEPs have secured a first-reading agreement on the ban. This means, effectively, that the Council is expected to back the Parliament's report (i.e. its amendments) and to adopt the legislation without any further changes. The ban will apply from 31 December 2008.
NGOs working in this sector estimate that around two million dogs and cats a year die in this trade in China alone, simply to supply the European market.

Consumers
Consumer confidence in the digital environment
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Zuzana ROITHOVÁ (EPP-ED, CZ), for the Internal Market Committee, will be tabling an own-initiative report on consumer confidence in the digital environment. The report deals with the very broad issue of confidence when using information and communication technologies for e-commerce, information services, digital communication and entertainment; in other words, the report relates to the everyday life of a majority of European consumers and business operators in the 21st century. The committee firmly believes it to be unacceptable that consumers are redirected from the vendor's website to some other website without being properly warned, since this causes the true identity of the actual supplier of the goods, services or content to be concealed from consumers.
MEPs call on the Commission, in addition to seeking to improve the quality of consumer legislation, to focus on developing appropriate rules for cross-border e-commerce in the form of standards to which holders of the European trustmark for cross-border e-commerce would adhere voluntarily.
The report calls on the Commission to support a suitable framework for the development of e-commerce that would boost the current low level of consumer confidence, create a more attractive business environment, improve the quality of legislation, reinforce consumer rights and the position of small business operators on the markets, and stop the fragmentation of the internal market in the digital environment.
Increasing consumer confidence in the digital environment
The report considers also that a relaunched e-confidence initiative should not only deal with consumer protection but also set out a coordinated approach to the issue of the digital environment as a whole, including analyses of non-market factors such as the protection of privacy, access by the general public to information technologies ('e-inclusion'), internet security.
European trustmark for cross-border e-commerce
The report calls on the Commission to initiate the definition of conditions and a logo for a European trustmark to guarantee greater certainty in the area of cross-border e-commerce and in this connection to ensure a general legal framework for voluntary trustmarks, as it was called on to do in the e-Commerce Directive ; recommends that this should involve:
– an inexpensive system,
– non-competition with existing trust- or quality marks,
– costs being borne only in the event of dispute,
– the self-regulatory principle (the mark is not awarded institutionally, but traders use it if they publicly demonstrate that they have provided compulsory information within a defined timescale, used recommended contracts, dealt with complaints without delay, used alternative dispute resolution (ADR) systems or conformed with other European standards),
- penalties for improper use.
The committee notes, however, the following problems with implementing effective trust mark schemes:
– unwillingness of stakeholders to invest in the marketing and promotion of such schemes;
– the possibilities for fraudulent use are opened unless proper supervision takes place. Rapporteur Zuzana ROITHOVÁ EPP-ED CZ A6-0191/2007 Consumer confidence in the digital environment Procedure : own-initiative

Employment policy
Minimum standards for supplementary pension rights
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Demographic changes are making supplementary pensions an increasingly important way of securing a decent standard of living in old age. Against this background, Parliament's Employment and Social Affairs Committee will ask the plenary to approve with amendments a draft directive seeking to facilitate worker mobility within and between EU Member States by laying down minimum standards for acquiring and preserving supplementary pension rights. Many people nowadays do not wish to rely on the basic state pension but contribute to supplementary or occupational pension schemes as well. People also change jobs more frequently than in the past but they can be discouraged by the "pensions issue": some occupational pension schemes impose waiting periods (before employees can even join the scheme they have to serve a minimum number of years with the employer); some schemes impose vesting periods (workers can join a scheme but do not derive any benefit from it until they have paid in for a minimum number of years); not all schemes recognise dormant rights (where workers can leave a job and hence the pension scheme but leave their contributions in, and then later claim a pension); not all schemes allow the transfer of rights to other schemes, let alone to schemes in other countries.
In short, there are huge inconsistencies across the EU, a situation which can create injustices as well as deterring workers from moving to new jobs, especially in other countries. This is why the Commission has brought forward the new directive.
Member States would be affected quite differently by this legislation. In some there are no supplementary pension schemes at all, in some the coverage is quite low, while in others most workers have occupational pensions.
UK and Ireland
In the UK, around 43% of the employed population have supplementary pensions. In Ireland 43.3% of employees are members of supplementary pension schemes only, with a further 3.5% having both a supplementary pension and a personal pension. Pension rights can be transferred within both countries but transferring them abroad is more problematic. The new EU legislation is thus of considerable interest to people who might wish to work abroad at some point during their lives.
View of EP committee
Parliament's Employment and Social Affairs Committee, in a first-reading report by Ria Oomen-Ruijten (EPP-ED, NL), broadly endorses the Commission proposal but spells out the point that the directive should apply to all supplementary pension schemes for workers, e.g. group insurance contracts, pay-as-you-go schemes, funded schemes or pensions backed by book reserves.
Acquisition conditions
The Employment Committee backs the Commission's plans for common minimum standards for acquiring supplementary pension rights. However, in their amendments MEPs seek to go further. They lay down a maximum "vesting" period of five years (i.e. after five years in a job, employees will have acquired rights that have to be paid or preserved if their employment ends) and state that no vesting conditions may apply to members of a scheme once they have reached the age of 25 (in Germany the current minimum age is 30 years). They also say that if an employee has not acquired vested pension rights when his employment ends, all contributions paid, or their investment value if the worker bears the risk, must be reimbursed.
Fair treatment of dormant pension rights
The committee also calls for outgoing workers to be allowed to retain their vested pension rights in a scheme. In addition, the report demands "fair treatment" of those dormant rights: their value should generally move in line with the rights of active members, for example in line with inflation or salary levels.
MEPs more cautious on transferability of pension rights
However, MEPs took a more cautious line on the transferability of pension rights, speaking against the Commission's proposal to include this right in the new directive. The Commission proposes that workers be able to transfer their vested rights to a new employer. In some countries this is currently not possible at all. In others, transfers are allowed internally but cross-border transfers might be hindered by tax rules or forbidden by law to prevent tax evasion.
On this issue, MEPs decided that Member States should "endeavour, as far as possible and in particular when introducing new supplementary pensions schemes, gradually to improve the transferability of vested pension rights". They also ask the Commission to draw up a report, no later than five years after the directive takes effect, on the conditions for transferring capital representing workers' supplementary pension rights. This report should be the basis for proposing any amendments to this directive.
As is common in EU legislation, the proposed standards represent a minimum. Nothing prevents employers and employees in individual Member States adopting higher standards.

New rules on ingredients and labelling of spirits - so what is vodka exactly?
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Parliament will vote on controversial new rules on the production and labelling of spirits such as whisky and vodka when a first-reading report from the Environment Committee comes before the plenary. A compromise text has just been agreed with Council covering all the main issues including the most hotly-contested one: the ingredients and labelling of vodka. However, amendments are likely to be tabled on precisely this point in plenary. Scotch whisky or Irish whiskey, rum, cognac, vodka, gin, marc, slivovice …. every nation has its favourite tipple. But in a European single market EU rules are needed on all these products to safeguard product quality, protect producers' rights and give consumers reliable information.
The new regulation drafted by the European Commission is an update of existing legislation. It will ensure compliance with WTO rules and standards agreed in the TRIP agreement on intellectual property rights, thus enabling EU producers to safeguard their "geographical indicators" on the world market.
How many categories of spirits?
The Commission's original proposal suggested establishing three categories of spirit drinks but the Environment Committee - in its first-reading report drafted by Horst Schnellhardt (EPP-ED, DE) and adopted by the committee in January - voted instead for a single category. This single category has been preserved in the compromise with the Council.
Battle over vodka ingredients
The Environment Committee also amended the Commission's proposals on the ingredients and labelling of vodka, which MEPs believed should only be described as traditional if it is produced from grain, potatoes or molasses. Vodka could be made from other ingredients, but this must be indicated in large wording on the label (2/3 of the size of the word 'Vodka').
The compromise envisages a slightly different approach: traditional vodka could only be made from grain or potatoes (not sugar beet molasses as the Environment Committee suggested). If the vodka is made from other raw materials, the ingredients must be stated on the label. However, the size of this label is not specified.
Some MEPs from traditional vodka-producing Member States (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden) would prefer to allow the name 'vodka' to be applied only to spirits made from grain, potatoes and molasses. They are likely to table amendments to the plenary to this effect.
Traditional whisky names safeguarded
The Environment Committee voted for existing geographical names to remain valid. These could be supplemented by additional descriptions provided they are regulated at national or regional level or are included in the technical specifications, such as "single malt" and/or "Highland" for Scotch whisky. Applications for geographical designations must justified by the Member State of origin. This point is unchanged by the compromise.
Flavourings banned in some products
The Environment Committee voted to ban flavourings of spirit drinks, contrary to the Commission's proposal. Moreover, said the committee, the addition of sweeteners should be regulated and they should be mentioned on the bottle label.
The compromise bans flavouring of certain categories of spirits (including rum, whisky/whiskey, grain spirits, wine spirits, brandies and others), although caramel may be added to them for colouring purposes. Other spirit drinks may have added alcohol (only of agricultural origin) as well as flavouring, colouring and sweetening.
Co-decision and entry into force
The Environment Committee argued that any changes to the definitions of spirits should take place under the co-decision procedure, thereby giving Parliament a say, but MEPs have dropped this demand under the compromise reached with Council. As a result, committees of experts will take such decisions.

Midway point of MDGs: Member States should honour their promises
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Glenys Kinnock (PES, UK) for the Development Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the midway point of the Millennium Development Goals. The report commends the Member States that have reached or exceeded the 0.7% Overseas Development Aid (ODA) / GNI target and those that are increasing their actual aid levels, but regrets that some EU-15 countries have missed the interim 0.33% target by a large margin in 2006. Italy missed the 0.33% target by wide margin, with its aid in 2006 amounting to only 0.2% of its national income, after a 30% drop in real aid levels. Portugal - due to host the EU-Africa Summit during its Presidency in 2007 -, achieved only 0.21% ODA/GNI in 2006.
The report notes that the worst inflators of aid are Austria (57%), France (52%), Italy (44%), Germany (53%) and the UK (28%). Germany, which holds the Presidencies of both the EU and G8, would not have reached the target of 0.33% ODA/GNI without inflating its aid.
The report calls on the Commission and Member States to exclude spending on debt relief from aid reporting, in line with what's been decided in Monterrey in 2002.
European Development Fund and the European Investment Bank
On the European Development Fund, the EP calls on the Commission to ensure that funds will be available during the probable transitional period (2008–2010), i.e. before the 10th EDF is ratified by all 27 Member States (most likely in 2010). The EU could decide to implement new forms of funding MDGs such as through the European Investment Bank (EIB), according to the report.
China
The Development Committee urges the EU and the G8 to recognise the growing importance of new donors and, in particular, China, and to engage these new donors in a dialogue on approaches and standards for external assistance, including the importance of applying internationally agreed norms and standards in aid implementation.
Healthcare
MEPs in the committee believe that healthcare infrastructure deserves stable and long term financial support from national budgets and international assistance in order to deliver on the health-related MDGs : reducing infant mortality by increasing immunization coverage, reducing maternal mortality by increasing access to skilled professionals, supporting research and development of and access to new diagnostics and therapies, providing safe drinking water and sanitation, and scaling up significantly towards the goal of universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support of HIV/AIDS, Malaria, TB and other diseases by 2010, including for marginalized populations and those most vulnerable to infectious diseases.

Development and cooperation
Work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Thierry CORNILLET (ALDE, FR) for the Development Committee will be tabling an own initiative report on the work of the African Caribbean Pacific - European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The report calls upon the Commission to honour its commitment without delay on the basis of the procedure applied in the case of the regulation establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation. The Assembly met twice in the course of 2006. The 11th session was held at Vienna (Austria) from 17 to 22 June and the 12th session was held at Bridgetown (Barbados) from 18 to 23 November. 2006 is the first year in which the sessions were reversed. Nine resolutions were adopted in that year, and there were seven joint delegations. In the course of its proceedings the Assembly welcomed not only the successive Co-Presidents of the ACP-EU Council but also the Members of the Commission responsible for development and humanitarian aid and for trade.
The report calls upon the ACP countries’ national parliaments strongly to urge their governments and the Commission to ensure that they, in collaboration with civil society organisations, are constantly involved in the programming, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the national strategy documents relating to cooperation between the EU and their country (2008-2013 period)
The Development Committee also regrets the use of voting in separate colleges, which led to the rejection of the resolution on East Africa at the Bridgetown Session, even though a majority of the Assembly members supported the resolution.

Mercury: ban exports and imports - and make storage safer
2007-06-14 - 09:28
The Environment Committee is tabling a report calling for a proposed ban on exports of mercury to be brought forward to 1 December 2010. It also wants stricter rules on storage of this substance, which is regarded as dangerous to health and the environment. In addition, it is proposing that an import ban be introduced from 1 July 2010, something which was not included in the Commission's draft legislation. In March 2006 Parliament adopted a resolution on a general strategy for mercury put forward by the Commission (see link below). The draft regulation on exports and storage is a specific application of the general strategy. Parliament's rapporteur on this topic is Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL, EL) and his first-reading report was adopted in committee by 30 votes to 12, with 1 abstention.
This regulation should not be confused with a separate one introducing restrictions on measuring instruments containing mercury, such as thermometers and barometers, which comes before Parliament's plenary in July.
Uses and hazards of mercury
Mercury can come from waste recycling (e.g. fluorescent lamps, batteries), natural gas cleaning or the industrial treatment of non-ferrous metals. It is used above all in the chlor-alkali industry, which has undertaken to convert towards techniques that are less dangerous to health and the environment; the old methods produce large quantities of highly toxic calomel (mercurous chloride).
Mercury is highly toxic to humans, especially when transformed into methylmercury. It is also bio-accumulative, meaning that it concentrates in the food chain. Numerous scientific studies blame it for cardiovascular and immune-system ailments. Above all it can affect the brain development of unborn children, even in minimal doses.
Mercury use is declining both in the EU and globally. Global demand is around 3,400 tonnes per year, with the EU-15 accounting for 440 tonnes in 2005.
Globally, the main uses of mercury are in small-scale gold mining, the chlor-alkali industry and production of vinyl-chloride monomer, the basis of PVC plastic. In the EU only the chlor-alkali industry remains a significant user, and it is progressively phasing out the use of mercury-containing cells in its production of chlorine. The next most significant use in the EU is in dental amalgam.
Exports to be banned
The world's biggest mercury mine (now disused) is situated in Almadén, Spain. Mining operations ceased there in 2003. However, the owner company, MAYASA, is collecting and trading internationally (mainly to developing countries) the mercury from western Europe's decommissioned chlor-alkali plants, as well as from other sources. It is estimated that between now and 2020 some 12,000 tonnes of mercury will become available due to the phasing-out of mercury cells from the EU chlor-alkali industry.
In reducing its mercury use, Europe is thus building up a stock of the metal, which it is currently disposing of on the world market, mainly sending it to developing countries where safety standards may leave much to be desired. Under the new regulation, this stock will from now on have to be kept at home, notably the 12,000 tonnes saved by the chlor-alkali industry.
Exports of mercury compounds to be banned too
In its draft legislation, the European Commission seeks to ban exports of metallic mercury only. MEPs wish to go much further by also applying this ban to cinnabar ore, calomel and other mercury compounds with a mercury concentration of above 5% by weight.
The Commission had proposed that the export ban should enter into force on 1 July 2011 but MEPs voted for this date to be brought forward to 1 December 2010. As and from 1 January 2010, products containing mercury which cannot be placed on the market in the EU may no longer be exported either.
Why not ban imports as well as exports?
Since it has a supply of mercury and an increasingly restrictive policy on the use of mercury use, should the European Union not also halt imports of this substance? The Environment Committee thinks so: it voted for imports to be banned and for Member States to meet their own demands for mercury, for example from waste recovery.
Safer storage
In their amendments MEPs also voted for tougher safety conditions for storage, for both environmental and health purposes. They believe any storage should be temporary, pending the final disposal of the mercury towards which all Member States should be working, notably by setting up financing arrangements which would be funded, in proportion to their production, by the chlor-alkali and other industries. The mercury could be stored in former salt mines or special surface facilities.
Under the polluter-pays principle, MEPs say the owner of the storage facility must be responsible for safety. They propose looking into the possibility of using a site at Almadén as the chief storage depot. As this site was until 2003 the biggest mercury mine in Europe, MEPs believe it would be appropriate if the area were to benefit from compensatory measures to boost employment and economic activity.
The Environment Committee also passed several amendments to ensure that the mercury trade is more closely monitored. Lastly, it calls for sanctions on anyone who breaches the regulation.

Cyprus and Malta heading for euro membership?
2007-06-14 - 09:28
MEPs are set to have their say on the request by both Cyprus and Malta to adopt the euro as their currency from 1 January 2008. The European Commission and the European Central Bank agree that they meet – or are about to meet – all the criteria for euro membership. The Economics Committee will vote on this issue on Monday evening with a debate and vote in the full Parliament to follow on Wednesday. MEPs will also hear statements from the Commission and Council on improving the way the Parliament is consulted. Parliament’s position is not binding, but the Council cannot act until Parliament has adopted its opinion. While there is relatively little controversy about the applications from Cyprus and Malta, some MEPs are concerned at the very short period within which they are being asked to react on this occasion and want to ensure this does not set a precedent for decisions on future euro area enlargements.
The main criteria set out in the treaty for entering the euro area are to have appropriately adapted all the relevant national legislation and to be in line with the convergence criteria covering inflation, national debt, budget deficits and interest rates. The applicant’s currency should also have been in the Exchange Rate Mechanism II for over two years.

Fiscalis 2013 – cooperation between national tax authorities
2007-06-14 - 09:28
MEPs will hold a first reading debate and vote on the EU’s new programme to facilitate cooperation between national tax authorities over the next six years, Fiscalis 2013. At the time of writing, discussions aimed at a first reading compromise with the Council have yet to bear fruit. Following on from the previous programme, Fiscalis 2013 aims to provide a forum for increasing knowledge and exchange of best practice between national tax authorities, to enhance the fights against fraud and illegitimate trade by strengthening cooperation and mutual assistance, including via computer information exchange systems and to help cut red tape for taxpayers by looking at the optimal balance between controls and the administrative burden they cause.
MEPs in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee gave their views in March, when they amended and adopted a draft report presented by Hans-Peter Martin (NA, AT). They are proposing a number of changes aimed at enhancing transparency of the scheme, and also want to limit it to EU Member States, where the Commission was proposing to include countries participating in the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy too.
The proposed budget for Fiscalis 2013 is around €157m. Rapporteur Hans-Peter MARTIN NI AT A6-0117/2007 Operation of taxation systems: Fiscalis 2013 Procedure : Codecison (1st reading)

Competition Policy in 2005
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Parliament will debate an own-initiative report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee on the EU’s competition policy in 2005. The report welcomes the Commission’s moves to modernise competition policy, in particular its reinforced stance on targeting cartels and unauthorised state aid, as well as the sectoral enquires launched by Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. The report, drawn up by Elisa FERREIRA (PES, PT), welcomes the Commission’s economic rather than rules-based approach, and the efforts to improve the quality of enforcement of decisions. It calls for further progress in reducing differences of interpretation by national courts, and suggests setting up a network of judicial authorities, similar to that already linking competition authorities – the European Competition Network.
Among other points, the report:
repeats Parliament’s call for clarification of the application of competition rules to services of general economic interest;
asserts that some taxation practices in certain Swiss cantons constitute state aid which breaches the EEC-Switzerland agreement of 1972;
expresses concern at the relative failure to achieve genuine competition in energy markets [§17], especially in a situation where markets open to new players might facilitate environmental progress;
suggests that progress would be welcome in reviewing the “two-thirds rule” which governs whether national or European competition authorities deal with a particular case;
stresses the need to avoid competition and duplication between Member States’ state aid schemes;
notes that EC competition policy should focus on aid practices of third countries which might favour competitors to EU firms in globalised markets, while preferring a cooperative, mutual recognition approach rather than subsidy competition. Procedure : own-initiative

MEPs to call to re-launch energy dialogue with Russia
2007-06-14 - 09:28
The International Trade Committee will ask Parliament to back its appeal for a constructive dialogue on economic relations between the European Union and Russia, an area overshadowed by recent disputes which were highlighted by divisions at the Samara summit of 17-18 May. The committee believes the future partnership should include a meaningful energy dimension to safeguard Europe's energy supplies from its primary source of oil and gas. "The sole means of achieving a formal agreement on energy, ratified by Russia, is to negotiate a new framework document, i.e. in the context of the new partnership and cooperation agreement" says the committee in an own-initiative report by Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl (EPP-ED, DE). The current partnership agreement expires in December 2007 and negotiations on a new one have reached deadlock. The EU remains highly dependent for its energy on the Russian Federation, taking 63% of the latter's oil exports and 62% of its natural gas exports.
The interruption of gas supplies to Ukraine at the beginning of 2006 and of oil to Lithuania at the start of 2007 are weighing heavily on EU-Russia relations. MEPs call on Moscow "to offer fair and nondiscriminatory treatment to all its partners". They also call for investment to modernise Russia's nuclear power stations.
Concern over climate for investment in Russia
MEPs note that the EU is open to investment from Russia. They therefore consider it "highly problematic" that foreign companies operating in the natural resource sectors in Russia are not granted the same degree of access. In particular, they voice concern at "the bill recently introduced in the Russian Federation, which allows the government to reject foreign bids for majority stakes in Russian companies, thus prohibiting foreign ownership of more than 49% […] in 39 strategic industries". They believe this measure risks damaging Russia's attraction to European investors, who are its main source of capital. MEPs also want to see increased efforts in the fight against corruption.
The report acknowledges that it is important for the EU that Russia should join the WTO but stresses that this "must not result in higher levels of import duties and stronger protectionism".
Intellectual property rights and Polish meat
According to the committee, the Russian court system needs to be adapted "in order to effectively protect intellectual property rights", in particular to combat the production and sale of counterfeit pharmaceutical products.
Russia's embargo on Polish meat has become another source of friction between Europe and Russia. MEPs urge the EU "to find a common solution to problems with exports to the Russian market", specifically relating to health and plant health issues. Russia is an important market for agricultural exports - meat, fish and dairy products - from several EU Member States.

MEPs to vote on a resolution on the Middle East
2007-06-14 - 09:28
The House is due to vote on a resolution on the situation in the Middle East following on from the debate in Brussels on 6 June at the last plenary session. European Parliament President Hans Gert Pöttering visited the Middle East from 27-31 May and he addressed the Israeli Parliament (Knesset) in Jerusalem on 30 May. Javier Solana , High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) briefed MEPs on his view of the situation as it stands in the region amid renewed violence between Israel and the Palestinians and in Lebanon. He told Members that "we've faced 40 years of suffering from both sides...we can look back at the past and see what mistakes we've made, or we can look at the future".
Although painting a stark picture of the situation he did express some optimism that the time may be right for progress towards peace. Indeed he said that not since the 2000 Camp David talks has there been a better time for peace.
He stressed three reasons why he thought this the case. The first was that an Arab peace was now in place. This refers to the Saudi Plan endorsed by the Arab league this year that would see Israel return to its 1967 borders in return for peace treaties and recognition from Arab states. The second factor Mr Solana noted was the psychological importance of the 40th anniversary of the six day war. Finally he said that for the first time the EU was strongly represented at the negotiating table. Motions for resolutions

Broadband can help bridge the digital divide
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Rolling out broadband internet connections to bring e-government, e-health, or e-learning on-line services to remote or rural areas like Greek islands or Andalusian mountains is vital to making Europe a world-leading knowledge-based economy. In an own-initiative report on broadband policy options the Industry Committee sets out measures to bridge the "digital divide" between urban and rural areas. At the end of 2006, 28% of all households within the EU27 had broadband internet access at home, says the Commission's latest Eurobarometer ' E-Communications household survey '. Measured by numbers of broadband lines rolled out, Europe has been ahead of the USA since October 2005. However, internet connection performance varies markedly across Europe, with some connections carrying more data, and faster, than others. Whereas in the Netherlands and Denmark broadband is quite common, very few households in Greece, Cyprus, Slovakia, and Romania have access to this technology.
A critical mass of 500 million users
Broadband availability is limited, especially, in inaccessible and rural areas like islands and mountains because the low demand outside metropolitan centres discourages service providers. Yet the report by Gunnar Hökmark (EPP-ED, SE) points out that a single market of nearly 500 million people with broadband connections would create "a globally unique critical mass of users", helping Europe to become "a world leading knowledge-based economy".
MEPs note that it is precisely in the EU's less-developed regions that broadband internet connections may contribute most to "more sophisticated, inclusive" health-care and education systems, by enabling distance-diagnosis and distance-healing as well as distance-learning applications in regions that lack a satisfactory school infrastructure. The report as approved by the Industry Committee calls on Member States to promote broadband connections at every school, university and educational centre in the EU "with a view to a future where 'no European child and no individual involved in educational programmes is left off line in Europe'".
Invest in broadband, but don't distort the market
Improving broadband infrastructure should therefore be a special priority for the use of EU structural and rural funds. MEPs in the committee believe that these funds could also be used for upgrading or replacing broadband networks that do not provide connections with "suitable functional capacity". Nevertheless, the report also calls on the Commission to closely examine whether the EU regulatory framework is fully implemented and whether state aid rules are applied whenever those funds are used for broadband investments. EU funding should not favour specific players or technological options, but "only the most efficient solutions" and should only be permitted "in under-served areas". The EU's role would be to provide "a regulatory framework that invites competition and private investment" and by the use of relevant funds to drive demand for broadband services.
The committee also urges the Community institutions and Member States to work with industry to solve problems (such as micro-payments, security and trust, interoperability and Digital Rights Management) that hamper the development of new business models in the broadband field.
Ensure equal access for service providers, stimulate competition
The Commission should ensure that all service providers have equal access to any broadband networks that have been rolled out with the help of EU structural and rural funds. The committee therefore advocates a "functional unbundling of access networks of market incumbents from their operating activities", so as to ensure fair and equal treatment of all operators. Moreover, for MEPs in the committee it is "imperative" that national regulators, competition authorities, national and local governments promote "more vigorous competition and investment in broadband markets". They should also take legal measures against abuses of dominant positions and cartels.

Financing of Galileo - MEPs to have their say
2007-06-14 - 09:28
MEPs will debate and vote on a resolution on the recent developments on the financing of Galileo - the EU's satellite navigation system. MEPs in the Budgets Committee urge the Commission to come up with a revised proposal for a regulation for the financing of the EU satellite navigation system. The funding proposal should be made under the co-decision procedure, the resolution says. A call for a revision of the financial framework is, in this case, explicitly made by MEPs in another paragraph.
A total of €1bn was foreseen by the financial framework for 2007-2013. Transport ministers meeting in Luxembourg on 8 June asked the Commission to provide further details of alternative scenarios to finance Europe's satellite navigation project Galileo, including the various options for public funding.
This decision effectively shelved the public-private-partnerships, or PPPs, initially-proposed to launch Galileo.
With the final price tag expected to be around €3.5bn(with € 1bn already accounted for in the EU budget), some MEPs in the Budgets Committee stressed the urgent need to move ahead with Galileo - or else face the embarrassment of being overtaken by emerging countries: "China and even India could have their systems up and running earlier than the EU", warned Catherine Guy-Quint (PES, FR).
According to Reimer BÖGE (EPP-ED, DE) Chairman of the European Parliament's Budget Committee, the House must have a full say with regard to the future financing of Galileo, the EU satellite navigation system.
The Chairman of the Budget Committee has said: "Parliament is furthermore ready to review its mid-term financial planning because it considers Galileo to be a project of added European value while at the same time strictly limiting any revision to it. We are thereby giving a clear indication that the consistency of the European budget is to be retained. We are therefore against any return to intergovernmental financing outside of the EU budget, as this would be a dangerous development running counter to further consolidation of the European Union."

Review procedures concerning the award of public contracts
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Jean-Claude FRUTEAU (PES, FR) for the Internal Market Committee will be putting forward a legislative report on review procedures concerning the award of contracts. The directive amends the “Remedies Directives”, the European Commission is seeking to improve economic operators’ recourse to effective and harmonised
procedures in cases of illegally awarded public procurement award contracts. This has been agreed as a first-reading deal. The proposal no longer contains the requirement for a double Standstill on framework contracts and so it should help achieve the benefits of stronger remedies for business (thus enhancing competitiveness) without adding unnecessary additional administrative burdens.
The proposed directive aims to improve the effectiveness of review procedures concerning the award of public contracts. The committee clarifies that the directive applies to "contracts within the meaning of this Directive include public contracts, framework agreements, public works concessions and dynamic purchasing systems."
Exemptions
In order to maintain the consistency and effectiveness of the directive and assign priority to simplicity of regulation, the committee prefers to limit the number of possible exemptions.
(a) It is therefore proposed that exemptions from the standstill periods should be confined to cases in which:
– there is only one tenderer and the contract is awarded to him
– there is no requirement of prior publication of a contract notice. This case includes very urgent cases.
These cases do not concern framework agreements: if exemptions were permitted there, it would give rise to excessive risks of evasion of the rules and objectives of the directive.
(b) As regards directly awarded contracts, exemptions from the rule of ineffectiveness of contracts (penalties) are confined to cases in which imperative public-interest reasons of a non-economic nature require them.

Internal market rules for defence procurement
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Arlene MCCARTHY (PES, UK), on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) will be asking the following questions to the Commission on derogations to internal market rules for defence procurement on the basis of Article. 296 TEC. As defence procurement is still being awarded within mostly fragmented national markets, the IMCO Committee takes note of the European Commission’s interpretative communication on the application of Art. 296 of the Treaty in the field of defence procurement (COM(2006)0779 final), adopted on 7 December 2006. This communication helped clarify the existing legal framework and specified under which conditions the derogations are allowed to apply.
The IMCO further notes efforts by the Commission to propose new legislation which should substantially contribute to creating a more competitive environment for the European defence industry and its suppliers. It highlights in particular the important role of defence procurement for the European economy.
The IMCO asks the European Commission the following questions.
1. What is the progress on the directive on the 'procurement of defence equipment not subject to the derogations of Art. 296 TEC' which is being drafted? What are the subsequent steps planned by the Commission?
2. How does the Commission evaluate, from the perspective of a fair and efficient working of the internal market, the situation within the European defence industry, where – in different Member States – a significant number of highly skilled jobs appear to be at risk? What impact does it expect the directive to have on the sector?
3. What is the Commission's strategy to induce Member States to cooperate more closely on defence procurement issues and to improve transparency and gradually open up their national defence procurement markets, in order to establish a productive and competitive environment for this sensitive sector?
What conclusions can be drawn from the Code of Conduct that was established in 2006? How does the Commission understand the future relationship between a directive and the Code of Conduct? Rapporteur Arlene MCCARTHY PES UK Oral Question Derogrations to internal market rules for defence procurement on the basis of Article 296 TEC Oral question to the Commission

Public procurement legislation - an action plan to encourage Member States to fulfil their obligations
2007-06-14 - 09:28
The Chair of the Internal Market Committee Arlene McCARTHY (PES, UK) will be presenting her own-initiative report on the transposition and implementation of public procurement legislation. The committee recommends that the Commission propose an action plan to encourage Member States to fulfil their obligation to tackle persistent and emerging transposition and implementation problems in public procurement, focusing on illegal direct awards and late or incorrect transposition. The committee welcomes the recent modernisation and simplification of the EU public procurement rules, which has significantly boosted efficiency in EU public procurement processes.
The new 2004 public procurement Directives set out a framework of minimum applicable standards for Member States and also enshrine relevant ECJ developments. In keeping with the drive for better regulation in the EU, the new Directives aim to simplify and modernise the earlier separate Directives on public procurement.
Given that public procurement accounts for in excess of 16% of EU Gross Domestic Product, and in the context of the challenges posed by EU enlargement, favouritism for national champions and other failures to award contracts on a competitive basis, are a continued threat to the health of a now expanded Internal Market.
Implementation of Community legislation on public procurement
The committee strongly believes that breaches of the rules could be reduced if Member States and the Commission introduced more collaborative practices. MEPs in the committee encourage therefore Member States and the Commission to actively promote informal exchanges at an early stage.
The committee considers that, given the number of infringements, the Commission should be given the human resources to police the implementation of public procurement legislation more effectively. MEPs also call on the Member States to provide the Commission with sufficient data on the implementation of the public procurement directives.
MEPs in the committee call for the introduction of national advisory agencies on public procurement to assist contracting authorities in the correct implementation of the public procurement rules, and to assist tenderers, in particular small and medium enterprises, in bidding for public contracts.

Visa policy
Uniform format for residence permits for third country nationals
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Carlos COELHO (EPP-ED, PT) for the Civil Liberties Committee will be tabling a non-binding report on uniform format for residence permits for third country nationals. The European Commission is presenting a new proposal regarding a common format for residence permits for third-country national on the basis that it has proven technically impossible to incorporate biometrics onto a visa or residence permit in the form of a “sticker”. The problems identified by the technical committee relate to the durability of the chip and the interference between several chips on one passport. Taking these technical challenges into account, the Council invited the European Commission in February 2005 to propose (within 24 months) alternatives such as incorporating biometric identifiers into residence permits in the form of a separate card.
With the intention of harmonising the format of residence permits issued by Member States to third-country nationals, the Council adopted in June 2002 a regulation to lay down a uniform format for "residence permits" (not to mistake with VISAS). However, some technical problems arose concerning the chip and what format to choose for the permit-sticker or standalone card-.
Finally in March 2006 the Commission presented a modified proposal which sets out that the unified residence permit will be produced as a standalone card, must be machine readable and include biometric data (facial image and fingerprints to be introduced within 2 and 3 years respectively).
The Civil Liberties Committee is backing this proposal. MEPs in the committee agree on the use of biometrics as it will help combating document fraud and falsification, but stress that such data needs to have "rigorous security standards" and be used only for verifying the authenticity of the document and identity of the holder: national governments must ensure confidentiality and prevent unauthorised access to data. MEPs in the committee say that specific rules should also strengthen the protection of data from children .
The Commission proposal also allowed Member States to insert in the residence permit a contact chip to store additional information useful for authentication (digital signature or use for e-government services for third-country nationals residing legally in EU territory). Although the committee welcomes, in principle, the insertion of the additional chip, MEPs stress that there is not sufficient proof to guarantee the protection and security of sensitive data and, therefore, they deleted this provision.

Exchanges between the Member States of information extracted from criminal records
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Agustín DÍAZ DE MERA GARCÍA CONSUEGRA (EPP-ED, ES) for the Civil Liberties Committee will be tabling a non-binding report on exchanges between the Member States of information extracted from criminal records. On 13 October 2004 the Commission adopted an initial proposal for a framework decision on the exchange of information extracted from criminal records, with a view to the short-term improvement of the mechanisms of the 1959 Convention. However, this proposal does not substantially alter those mechanisms, and takes only a partial step towards remedying their dysfunctions. The present proposal is aimed at a major reform of those mechanisms, so as to ensure that the Member State of nationality can give a swift, correct, complete and exhaustive reply to the requests for information it receives.
Account should also be taken of the Council framework decision on the taking into account of convictions in the Member States of the EU in the course of new criminal proceedings. At the JHA Council meeting of 4 and 5 December 2006 a general agreement was reached on the application of that decision; nonetheless, it can only be effective if there are mechanisms to facilitate the exchange of information on criminal records.
The committee believes that the Commission's proposal is to be welcomed, and considers that the implementation of the proposed mechanism will make a positive contribution to the adoption of resolutions in the legal field.
The committee proposes a number of amendments aimed at making the proposal more inclusive and clarifying its wording. Some of the amendments are intended to bring it into line with the framework decision on the taking into account of convictions in the Member States of the EU in the course of new criminal proceedings.
The proposal needs to be clearly and precisely worded, avoiding conditional formulations which could give the impression that the transmission of information could be purely a matter for Member States' goodwill. Equally, its legal terminology in each of the language versions must correspond in full with that in use in the Member State concerned.
In order to boost the efficiency in practice of legal cooperation in the criminal field, it is important to maintain the mechanism proposed by the Commission, under which:
1. the Member State of nationality will be responsible for keeping the information on convictions of its own nationals;
2. any alteration or deletion of information on criminal records that occurs in the convicting Member State must entail the same alteration or deletion in the Member State of nationality.
The arrangements for alteration or deletion of criminal records are very important. There are of course two possibilities: those alterations or deletions can follow either the law of the Member State of nationality of the convicted person, or that of the convicting Member State.
With the first option, criminal records arising from a sentence of a national court would be available or not to the other Member States depending on the convicted person's nationality. A Member State asking for information from the register of the Member State of nationality would not necessarily obtain all the information existing on the person concerned: it would obtain only such data as the Member State of nationality believed it should keep under its own law.
It appears more correct to apply the law of the convicting Member State. In this case, even if there would be no guarantee that the same rules would apply on the time-period for keeping criminal records, the formula avoids distortions arising from nationality and ensures the integrity of the data contained in the registers of criminal records.
Finally, the decision must not propose requirements which it would be difficult for the Member States to comply with, as this would slow down the exchange of information. Some of the provisions proposed would entail creating sub-indexes or sub-registers which would delay implementation of the mechanism to be created.

Progress in negotiations concerning the framework decision in combating racism and xenophobia
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Martine ROURE (PES, FR) for the Civil Liberties Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on progress in negotiations concerning the framework decision n combating racism and xenophobia. On 20 April 2007, the Council of EU Justice Ministers in Luxembourg achieved political agreement on a Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. The Council says in its political agreement that the maximum penalty for approval, denial or gross trivialisation of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes will also be at least one to three years in prison.
The Framework Decision provides for minimum harmonisation of the criminal provisions to combat racism and xenophobia. The focus is on the prohibition of public incitement to violence and hatred against persons of a different race, colour, religion, or national or ethnic descent. This prohibition is the common prerequisite for imposing criminal liability for any conduct of this sort. However, the Framework Decision does not prohibit specific symbols per se, such as swastikas.
In view of the fact that the German Presidency has proposed to the Council that the negotiations be continued on the basis of a text submitted on 15 January 2007, the Civil Liberties committee addresses the following recommendations to the Council:
(a) send out a strong political message in support of a Citizens’ Europe and provide a high level of protection for fundamental rights through the avoidance of a third failure in respect of the proposal for a framework decision,
(b) make education towards peace, non-violence and respect for fundamental rights, and an interfaith and intercultural dialogue at EU level the main instruments of the fight against racism and xenophobia,
(c) ensure that the framework decision contributes European added value over and above the 1996 Joint Action and does not merely combine the various Member-State positions,
(d) together with the Commission, apply more actively existing anti-discrimination and anti-racist legislation and Treaty provisions, and monitor closely the future transposition and implementation of the framework decision in each Member State, and report back to the European Parliament; ensure that the Commission starts infringement proceedings against those Member States which fail to implement the legislation,
(e) recognise that some Member States have criminalised the denial or flagrant trivialisation of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes,
(f) insert in the final text of the framework decision the definition of racist and xenophobic offences which is already included in the Commission proposal for a framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia, pursuant to which “directing, supporting or participating in the activities of a racist or xenophobic group with the intention of contributing to the organisation's criminal activities” is punishable as a criminal offence,
(g) define more closely and more clearly derogations and the options for excluding certain types of behaviour from criminal responsibility (with particular reference to behaviour towards a group of people or a member of such a group defined by reference to its religion),
(h) exclude from the derogations the notion of a public order offence, since it is not based on a precise definition of that concept,
(i) leave intact the possibility of derogating from the principle of dual criminal liability in order to enable the Member States to provide mutual support in judicial matters for the purpose of prosecuting those who behave in a racist and xenophobic fashion and in order to enable cross-border racist movements to be combated as an essential part of the compromise achieved,
(j) incorporate a non-regression clause such as the one contained in Article 6 of Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin(7), in order to ensure that the implementation of the framework decision does not lead to a weakening of existing forms of protection,
(k) ensure that implementation of the framework decision will not undermine any obligation imposed pursuant to the abovementioned 21 December 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,
(l) set up, under the aegis of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, a unit for the purpose of monitoring similar offences in the Member States, its task being to record, store and classify data,
(m) ensure that the framework decision is satisfactorily implemented by allowing the Commission report to take account of the opinions of the Fundamental Rights Agency and the non-governmental organisations concerned, in accordance with the model established in Directive 2000/43/EC,
(n) introduce a comprehensive legal framework enabling discrimination to be combated in all its forms, through the swift adoption of a comprehensive directive on the fight against discrimination (pursuant to Article 13 of the Treaty) which should provide for effective, proportionate and deterrent penal sanctions for all forms of discrimination, as well as administrative sanctions, rehabilitative sanctions such as mandatory education and community service, or fines, which, in the case of public figures and representatives of the authorities, should be more severe owing to the fact that their status should be considered to be an aggravating circumstance,
(o) take into account the fact that there should be no hierarchy among the grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13 of the Treaty and that, accordingly, these forms of discrimination deserve equal attention from the Council; include within the scope of criminal liability hate crimes and violent crimes based on those grounds or a combination of those grounds (multiple discrimination).

Asylum policy
Common European Asylum system
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Hubert PIRKER (EPP-ED, AT) for the Civil Liberties Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report on a common European Asylum system. The report condemns the clearly inadequate resources available to the Commission to monitor the implementation of the various directives which deal with asylum-related matters. The committee urges the Member States to facilitate the Commission's task by systematically submitting to it a table of equivalences setting out exactly what measures have been taken to implement what provisions of those directives.
MEPs in the Civil Liberties Committee calls on the Council and the Commission to work to bring about the introduction in all Member States of a single procedure which makes for fair and effective decision-making, in order to ensure that refugee status is granted as quickly as possible to all those who are entitled to it.
Information campaigns in the countries of origin
The report calls for information campaigns to be carried out in countries of origin and transit with a view to making clear to potential migrants both the risks inherent in illegal immigration and the consequences of denial of refugee status, and the scope for legal migration and the possibility to apply for asylum in a justified case, as well as the dangers involved in trafficking in human beings, in particular women and unaccompanied minors.
The report calls for the measures applicable to persons who have been granted refugee status or humanitarian protection to be implemented quickly and fairly, in order that decent living conditions, effective integration in social and political life and shared active involvement in decisions taken by the host community may be fostered.
MEPs in the committee want the Commission to overcome as quickly as possible the technical and political problems involved in introducing a joint database containing information about countries of origin.
The report stresses the need to establish reception centres with separate facilities for families, women and children and suitable facilities for elderly and disabled asylum-seekers.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Students with family responsibilities need appropriate assistance
2007-06-14 - 09:28
The Women’s Rights and Gender Equality Committee is proposing a report on a regulatory framework for measures enabling young people to combine family life with their studies or training.
In the report, MEPs in the committee call among other things for tax breaks, appropriate housing, sufficient childcare and flexible study conditions for young women and men with family responsibilities. National "certification" schemes for family-friendly higher-education establishments should also be set up.
MEPs in the committee point out in the report by Maria PANAYOTOPOULOS-CASSIOTOU (EPP-ED, EL) that according to the conclusions of the Green Paper on demography, the European demographic deficit is due in part to the various stages of life (education, work, family) being reached later. On the other hand, it also means more and more students have family responsibilities - in Sweden, 41% and in Finland, 31% of women had their first child before completing their education. MEPs in the committee therefore want the Commission and the Member States to "promote policies which make it easier to combine studying, training and family life and which support the balanced assumption of family responsibilities by young people" .
Resources have to be suited to needs
MEPs encourage the Member states to be more aware of the situation of young men and women, who have family responsibilities while they are in education or training and particularly to make available to them resources suited to their needs. They encourage the Member States to offer affordable "student insurance", in particular social and medical cover - which could be extended to the student’s dependants and "to reduce or put an end to taxation of young people who both study and work and who have family responsibilities or responsibilities towards dependants". MEPs in the committee also call on the Member States and credit institutions to simplify and facilitate loans on advantageous conditions to young people who combine family responsibilities with their studies.
The higher education establishments on their part are invited "to take account of the financial situation of young men and women who have family responsibilities when calculating course fees and encouraged to provide appropriate assistance". Member States and higher education establishments are both asked to continue to provide social benefits to persons with family responsibilities for six months after they complete their studies, so as to make it easier for them to enter the labour market.
Suitable housing and childcare
The Member States are encouraged to adopt measures to enable students who are parents to live in housing that is suited to their needs and to have access to sufficient and adequate child care under the same conditions of eligibility as working parents. In doing that they should make full use of the possibilities provided by Community funds and in particular the ESF in this area.
The higher education and vocational training establishments are also encouraged to set up child-care services on their premises and MEPs believe Member States should support such initiatives.
Flexible study conditions
The Women's Rights Committee also calls on the Member States, in association with higher education or vocational training establishments, to propose more flexible ways of organising study courses, for example by increasing the provision of distance learning and the possibilities for part-time study and by allowing more adults to continue their education, as part of lifelong learning.
In addition to that, Member States should establish a national "certification" scheme for the identification of higher-education or vocational-training establishments at which student life and family life may be combined.
Exchange of best practice and possible reform of education systems
MEPs in the committee recommend to the Member States, Council and Commission that in the Open Coordination Method and meetings of education ministers and social services ministers, they exchange best practice concerning support for students with family responsibilities and take account of innovative arrangements in this area which some European countries have introduced.
The report also calls on the "Member States to consider, according to their national situation, whether a reform of their education system to encourage flexibility and better management of time in education would have the effect of enabling young people to begin their working lives at an earlier stage and achieve their desire for motherhood and fatherhood".

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Tackling juvenile delinquency
2007-06-14 - 09:28
Prevention, social inclusion and decriminalisation are the key points of a strategy for combating juvenile delinquency proposed in a report by the Women's Rights Committee. Practical measures should include a European Juvenile Delinquency Observatory and a Community framework programme, say MEPs. In the own-initiative report, drafted by Katerina BATZELI (PES, EL), MEPs note that juvenile delinquency has assumed huge proportions and is starting at a younger age. They believe an integrated strategy at national and European level is the only way to tackle the problem.
Policies at national level
All stakeholders in society must be directly involved in devising and implementing national strategies, says the report. An integrated and effective school, social, family and educational policy is needed to pass on social and civic values and help young people adjust to society at an early age. Reducing social inequalities and child poverty are also crucial.
Three levels of action are identified in the report: primary prevention directed at all members of society, secondary prevention directed at occasional and potential juvenile offenders and tertiary prevention directed at persistent juvenile offenders.
"Legislative management measures" (i.e. a move towards decriminalisation) and other steps, e.g. one-year parental leave, special training for teachers, conflict management courses and a (European) "road map" for the media are also proposed.
Policies at European level
At EU level, MEPs say that governments and the Commission should agree on minimum standards and guiding principles common to all Member States. Models should be devised for managing juvenile delinquency, while custodial measures and punishment should be the last resort. The Commission should fund preventive measures under existing Community programmes and create a new budget heading for actions and networks to combat juvenile delinquency and to contribute to the social integration of all young people.
In addition, the Commission should set up a European Juvenile Delinquency Observatory to collect statistics from all Member States, disseminate experience and plan innovative programmes at international, inter-regional and Community level.
The Commission is also asked to put forward an integrated Community framework programme involving Community preventive measures, support for NGO initiatives and transnational cooperation, and the funding of regional and local pilot programmes. This would be based on best national practice, would attempt to disseminate this best practice throughout Europe and would cover social and educational infrastructure.

Fisheries
Industrial fisheries and the production of fishmeal and fish oil
2007-06-14 - 09:28
The House will vote on an own-initiative report by the Fisheries Committee which stresses the problem of discards from marine fisheries - up to 1 million tonnes a year in Europe, according to estimates. The committee suggests that use of discards by the fishmeal and fish oil industry should be examined, given the rapidly expanding EU fish farming (aquaculture) industry. Another issue is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Concern has been expressed about whether using fishmeal and fish oil for animal feed can spread BSE. However, the report - drafted by Struan STEVENSON (EPP-ED, UK) - argues that "there is no scientific evidence to support banning fishmeal on the grounds that it may transmit BSE or other TSEs". It also stresses that there are no ethical reasons for prohibiting the use of fishmeal in EU ruminants' diets and notes that a ban on feeding of fishmeal to ruminants is likely to exacerbate welfare concerns. It therefore calls on the Commission and the Council to lift the ban on feeding fishmeal and fish oil to ruminants.
The Fisheries Committee welcomes the €25 million investment by the fishmeal and fish oil industry in Denmark and the UK, aimed at eliminating dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs and ensuring the creation of a safe and healthy product.
Fishmeal widely used in animal feed
The UK is the largest consumer of fishmeal in the EU largely because of its large fish farming sector. Germany, France, Spain, Denmark and the Netherlands use fishmeal for their agriculture and aquaculture sectors. Greece, Italy and the smaller Mediterranean islands rely on fishmeal for their sea bass and sea bream aquaculture.
Fishmeal is not eaten directly by people with the exception of very small volume sales of fishmeal tablets in Norway sold through pharmacies for dietary supplements of sportspersons. About 33% of the fishmeal consumed in the EU is fed to farmed fish; the balance is fed to pigs and poultry. Thus the effect of fishmeal on human health is as a result of the meat eaten from farmed fish, pigs, and poultry fed on the product as a feed ingredient. Fishmeal is rich in both essential amino acids in the form of protein, and in the long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA (PUFAs) which provide health and welfare benefits to animals. Meat, milk and eggs from farm animals fed on fishmeal and oil are, in turn, foods that benefit human health.
