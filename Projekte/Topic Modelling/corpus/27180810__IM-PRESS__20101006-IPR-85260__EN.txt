MEPs strongly condemn the mass rape and human rights violations inflicted on at least 500 women and children between 30 July and 4 August in North Kivu province, Democratic Republic of Congo. In a plenary resolution passed on Thursday, they call on the United Nations and Kinshasa to conduct an impartial and thorough investigation of the attacks.
The cases of mass rape in the east of the DRC should be referred to the International Criminal Court, says the resolution, approved on Thursday with 585 votes in favour, 8 against and 34 abstentions.
More than 500 people were victims of mass gang rape, including young girls, women as old as 75 and baby boys and girls, from 30 July to 4 August, in the eastern Congo mining district. These attacks were perpetrated by the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a Hutu rebel group, and the Mai Mai militia.
MEPs voice "deep concern" that the UN's MONUSCO Mission could not use its mandate to provide protection against such mass rape and other human rights abuses by armed movements, in the vicinity of its peacekeeping base.
They also call for the creation of a "true" and decently paid and trained national army, able to control the mineral-rich eastern region of the DRC.
MEPs underline that the rehabilitation and reform of the judicial system, including prevention and protection and combating impunity with regard to sexual violence, and also assistance for and reintegration of victims, should be central to the aid programmes to be funded.
