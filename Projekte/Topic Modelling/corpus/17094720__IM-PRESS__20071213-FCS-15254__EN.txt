Persevering for Peace: a conversation with Hans-Gert Pöttering
Institutions
2007-12-19 - 13:02
Since becoming President of the European Parliament in 2007, Hans-Gert Pöttering has consistently put two related subjects at the top of his, and thus the Parliament's, political agenda: peace in the Middle East and intercultural dialogue. Rather than being typical items in the in-tray of a political leader, observers note that these subjects, respectively perhaps the most intractable and the most sensitive issues facing modern politicians, are for Pöttering sources of personal motivation.
The past year has seen a range of activities, many reported on this website, where Pöttering has pursued his - and Parliament's - interest in supporting the peace process and bringing cultures together. He has travelled in some of Europe's most troubled neighbours, talked politics with key players, met religious leaders from many faiths and engaged with ordinary people living in extraordinary situations.
As the 2007 ends, and 2008 - the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue - arrives, we met President Pöttering to talk about the role of the European Parliament in helping bring peace and reconciliation to those most in need of it, but also about some of the personal experiences and impressions his work has brought him.

"Hope and optimism are part of our lives"
"Understanding between cultures is crucial for world peace" We met Hans-Gert Pöttering to talk about how Parliament can contribute to peace in the Middle East and the role to be played by fostering intercultural dialogue.
Your first official visit as President was to Israel, Palestine and Jordan. Do you believe that post-war European reconciliation can offer any hope or lessons for the people of the Middle East?
We were very successful in Europe after the Second World War in bringing peace to what is now the European Union. Some say that this European example cannot be an example for other parts of the world. My question is: why not? There were once wars between the peoples of Europe in almost every generation, but we finally learned the lessons. This should be possible in the Middle East as well. Our great ambition must be that both Israel and the Palestinians can live in safety, develop good relations, identify common interests and build a partnership together.
It is our responsibility to do our utmost to support dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis. Of course, all the countries in that region have to be involved - including the whole Arab world. Our American friends are working for this, but we Europeans must not leave this to them alone. We should be more engaged: not only by giving out financial aid, but being decisive in promoting the peace process in the Middle East. This is one of the great challenges for 2008, which is also year of dialogue between cultures.
Your activities indicate that you believe the European Parliament has an important role to play in the world's efforts at peace and reconciliation in the Middle East and wider the neighbourhood. What special influence do you think the Parliament can bring to bear?
It is vital to speak to the people holding responsibility: politicians in Israel, politicians in Palestine. Many EU officials are doing this: Javier Solana (EU High Representative foreign affairs) and the European Commissioner for External Relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
The leaders of the political groups in Parliament recently accepted my proposal to invite the President of Israel, Shimon Peres, to come to the Parliament next year. We have also decided to invite Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestine Authority. So hopefully both of them will come. We also invited the Grand Mufti of Damascus, Dr. Ahmad Badruddin Hassoun.
These are just a few of those we are inviting to a conference in the European Parliament early in 2008, in which Tony Blair, with his responsibilities for the Middle East, will also participate. We hope this way to make our contribution to the peace process.
Also in 2008 we plan to organise an "Arab Week" and events to celebrate 60 years of the State of Israel. We want to invite young people from Israel and Palestine and bring them together with young Europeans, to help them develop an understanding for each other. Such steps help build confidence and the wider peace process.
Next year will be the year of Intercultural Dialogue. You have said this is central to your mandate. Why is this theme so important for you?
Understanding between cultures is crucial for world peace. In particular, relations between the Western world and the Arab and Islamic world will be decisive for the 21st century. It is my deep belief that terrorism should not have the chance to take root. Some terrorists claim that they use force because Islam teaches them to do so. This is not acceptable, for Islam is in itself a peaceful religion.
I never forget the speech to the European Parliament made by the late Egyptian leader Anwar Al Sadat, in which he powerfully made that point: that real Islam is a religion of peace. We must take our opportunity to connect with people of good will in the Islamic world. If we do, the "clash of civilisations" some predict cannot happen. It is thus our responsibility to develop this dialogue, which must however be based on mutual tolerance and truth. It cannot be a one-way street.
Sometimes there seems little cause for hope. Are you optimistic that things can really change for the better?
Have you ever seen a pessimist win through in the end? We have to be optimistic. As a Christian, I say hope and optimism are part of our lives. You can only be successful and achieve your goals if you believe in them. Take the European integration process. I have had the privilege to be in the European Parliament since 1979. At that time many people would never have thought that Europe would be reunited, that we would have a strong European Parliament, a strong European currency - yet we have achieved all this. Not in one week, but through hard work, good will and the cooperation of others. So I am optimistic that we will be successful as far as the dialogue of cultures is concerned.

The Bnat n'Soumer association in Algeria
With women at the Bnat n'Soumer women's association in Algeria: October 2007 In this, and the next two sections, President Pöttering gave us his personal impressions of some of the activities he has undertaken in the cause of peace and reconciliation.
In October, you visited Algeria, a country which has suffered much from terrorist violence, and met the Bnat n'Soumer women's association in Algeria. What was it about these women that struck you so much?
It was very impressive that these ladies, young ladies, elderly ladies, devoted themselves to victims of terrorism. People there have suffered terribly from terrorism and they need psychological assistance and support. That these ladies were prepared to provide this was a genuine example what we call Nächstenliebe [love for one's neighbour]. This showed a true wish for the reconciliation of society. Reconciliation is a wonderful basis for human beings to move into the future together. It does not give terrorism an opening.
Editors Note: the interview took place prior to the bomb attacks in Algiers on 11 December. Following these Mr Pöttering issued a condemnation of the attacks and sent a message of sympathy to the Algerian people on behalf of the European Parliament.

Meeting school children in Ramallah
Ramallah, 28 May 2007 In the course of your visit to the Palestinian Territories in May, you made a point of including encounters with ordinary people in your itinerary. This included a visit to a school in Ramallah. What thoughts did that visit provoke for you?
It brought home to me that Palestinian schoolboys and schoolgirls are just as happy, and sometimes just as sad, as Israeli schoolboys and schoolgirls. They study just as carefully as Israeli boys and girls. So human beings are equal. I said this before the Knesset (the Israeli Parliament): the dignity of Israelis is the same as that of Palestinians.
We must acknowledge the dignity of each human being, because to do so is to recognise the need for cooperation and dialogue. This is the basis for living together. It strikes one forcefully when one meets so-called ordinary people that they react one way: they want to live in peace, fulfil their ambitions and live in a free society. This is what being human is all about. See President Pöttering's visit to the West Bank: 28 May 07 MEPs express "deepest concern" about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza: 11 October 07
Contemplating the horrors of the past - Yad Vashem
Yad Vashem - "past has to be a lesson" In Israel, also during your May visit, you went to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem. Does contemplating this darkest of stains on European history offer any insights which can help bring peace to the current-day Middle East?
This visit to Yad Vashem reminded me of what crime and terror can be created by human beings. As a German, I was especially sad to reflect again that all this was done by people mainly coming from my own country. What happened in those terrible years in Europe, in Germany, must be a lesson for us: it must never happen again. Nor must we ever view others on the basis of their race. All human beings are equal and we have to defend the dignity of all human beings. The past has to be a lesson for both the present and our future.

And finally…
European Parliament, Strasbourg, Christmas 2007 We have talked about some weighty subjects, but the Christmas and New Year holidays are before us and everyone is entitled to a break. What are your plans for the festive season?
I will spend the Holy Evening with my family. After Christmas I will go skiing with my grown-up sons in Switzerland. From there though you can ski to the other side of the mountain in Italy - and be back in the European Union!
Happy Christmas to all your readers and all the best for 2008! Website of Hans-Gert Pöttering
