The EU should pass a "Single Market Act" by May 2011, setting out a policy priorities for creating a highly competitive social market and green economy and covering both legislative and non-legislative initiatives, says a report on delivering the single market to consumers and citizens, approved by the Internal Market Committee on Wednesday.
The single market and consumer protection policy implications of the Lisbon Treaty and Europe 2020 strategy are set out in this own-initiative report, drafted by Louis Grech (S&D, MT) against the backdrop of the economic and social crisis. It is intended as Parliament's contribution to a report being prepared by Mario Monti, at Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso's request, to develop a "comprehensive concept" to revitalise the single market.
The committee considers strengthening the single market to be essential if the Europe 2020 strategy is deliver protection for citizens and consumers and preserve the social dimension of the EU model, whilst at the same time giving the Union the competitive edge it needs.
MEPs call on the Commission to incorporate in the future "Single Market Act", specific measures to ensure that single market policy focuses on consumer interests and social welfare, improves consumer and small business access to e-commerce and digital markets, support the development of an inclusive, low-carbon, green, and knowledge-based economy, protect services of general economic interest and create a strategy for better communicating the single market's social benefits.
The Grech report was approved with 32 votes in favour, none against and 3 abstentions. The plenary vote is scheduled for May 2010.
