Much was at stake in a snow covered Strasbourg when the European Parliament met in December: the EU's 2011 budget, WikiLeaks, toxic toys & permits for migrants. It also saw the award of the Sakharov prize to Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas. The traditional Flame of Peace arrives at the European Parliament in Strasbourg from Bethlehem every December. EP President Jerzy Buzek meets those who had helped carry it there. WikiLeaks: Healthy transparency or a threat to national security? EC President Barroso answered MEPs' questions on the subject. He defended freedom of speech but also the right to privacy and data protection against cyber attacks. Dutch MEP Corien Wortmann-Kool (EPP) enjoys a lighter moment during a debate. "Yes, we did it". Satisfaction for Zita Gurmai (S&D, Hungary) and Alain Lamassoure (EPP, France). By the end of 2011, one million citizens from at least 7 member states will have the right to propose new legislation. Rebecca Harms (Greens/EFA, Germany) indicates the Political Group voting line to her colleagues during the vote on the budget. Last minute deal on the 2011 budget. After debates, discussions and many disagreements inside the European institutions, the EU has its budget for 2011, committing the EU to a €141.9 billion of expenditure next year.

An empty chair and a Cuban flag. There were the two symbols of the Sakharov 2010, awarded to Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas. Guillermo Fariñas did not come to the Parliament for the Sakharov Prize award ceremony. His health is weak and he fears exile if he leaves Cuba. But his message of hope and resistance filled the Chamber in Strasbourg. And the last 2010 sitting ends...Members of Parliament leave Strasbourg and look ahead to the challenges of the New Year. Click on the photos for some of the action from the Parliament's December sitting in Strasbourg Sakharov, EU budget, crisis mechanism for euro and Wikileaks all feature on agenda The award of the Sakharov human rights prize saw an ovation for a Cuban dissident represented by an empty chair, the EU finally got its 2011 budget, Commission President Barroso fielded MEPs' questions on Wikileaks, the rules for a brand new democratic mechanism were laid down and political disagreements erupted Interrupting a draft law on a proposed new single EU work permit, meaning the last plenary of 2010 wrapped up the parliamentary year in suitably dramatic fashion.
Sakharov prize : A moving taped message of defiance to the Cuban regime by Guillermo Fariñas was played Wednesday during the award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to him. He was unable to travel to Europe to receive his prize and instead an empty chair represented the Cuban dissident and journalist. He urged people in the West not to forget the plight of the Cuban people.
1 & 7: 1 million people from 7 countries will have the right to propose, oppose or demand changes to existing EU legislation under the new " citizens' initiative" backed by MEPs this week. It should come into force by the end of 2011.
€141.9 billion in commitments and €126.5 billion in payments; that is how much the newly adopted EU budget for 2011 is worth. The total figure provides more funding for key priorities set by MEPs including youth, innovation and the Middle East peace process.
Members keep up pressure to ban battery cages for hens
Chickens were back on the Parliament's legislative menu. A ban on battery cages for hens should be in place within two years but many Members were concerned that some European countries may not respect that deadline. In a resolution they called on the European Commission (which runs Europe's Common Agricultural Policy) to check on progress and take action against governments if necessary.
3 special guests : Among many attending the Sakharov ceremony was three fans of Parliament’s Facebook page, who won a trip to participate in the event. Almost 2,000 people registered on Facebook to take part in the prize draw.
The traditional "Flame of Peace" arrived at the European Parliament from Bethlehem and was presented to EP President Jerzy Buzek by a group of scouts. In the run up to Christmas it will be carried all over Europe.
Wikileaks furore debated in Parliament
Wikileaks: The implications of the latest Wikileaks revelations and what it means for cyber security were debate by MEPs and the Head of the EU's executive, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso Tuesday. Many MEPs were concerned about the fate of its founder Julian Assange and to what extent European countries are vulnerable to cyber attack. Mr Barroso said the Commission had unveiled new plans in September to guard against attacks.
In the EU there are around 16 million "international" marriages. But if love turns sour, which law should apply to the divorce ? Parliament endorsed new rules allowing European couples to choose which EU country's law should govern their divorce. The new legislation is the first example of an "enhanced co-operation procedure" between 14 countries.
No agreement on single permit for legal immigrants across EU countries
In a resolution passed on 15 December, Members called for better protection of vulnerable consumers from intrusive and misleading advertising , in order to assure respect for privacy and protection of the most vulnerable, namely children.
MEPs and their political parties could not agree on a draft single permit law to simplify procedures for legal immigrants to obtain residence and work permits in the EU. After several amendments were passed, the proposal was no longer acceptable for the majority and it will now return to the Committees for further discussion...
Toys under detox : During this festive season MEPs strongly backed EU-wide limits on certain chemicals in toys and want an EU standard for toy safety. Consensus may prove difficult as there are different scientific views over what levels of chemicals can be considered safe. Perhaps Father Christmas could offer some advice...
