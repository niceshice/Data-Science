Portuguese MEP Carlos Coelho stressed the need to ensure the external borders to the passport free zone are secure Portuguese MEP Carlos Coelho has specialised on border issues Recalls queuing up at border controls Travelling around Europe without passport controls is one of the most tangible aspects of the European Union. Launched at the small Luxembourg town of Schengen a quarter of a century ago, it has become more successful than its founders had dared. However, the importance of the external border to the Schengen area have become crucial and the free movement of people has raised concerns. We spoke to Portuguese centre-right MEP Carlos Coelho who has authored several reports on Schengen.
What was the defining moment?
The most important date was definitely 1985, when we began the Schengen adventure because it represents a switch from the idea of economic integration to a Europe of citizens. Before that we spoke about the internal market, goods, money, services, but, after, we started to speak about people.
Now we have to build the Europe of people, of citizens. 1985 marks the point when we began to pull down internal borders and assure the freedom of circulation in the EU.
What are the main advantages of Schengen?
The first advantage is about people having the right to circulate inside the Schengen area, inside the EU and the countries that are associated with the area - Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and, probably soon, Liechtenstein. I remember people queuing to travel from Portugal to Spain and vice-versa, stopping at the border, so the police could check the amount of candy we had in our cars. It's unbelievable but true - and not so many years ago!
There are also a lot of advantages connected with fighting crime. We know that trans-border criminal organisations are growing. These types of crimes - trafficking of human beings, drug trafficking, money laundering, nuclear and the dangerous chemical trade - are increasing and no country, no government, can fight these trends alone.
In the Schengen area we have a lot of tools for information exchange, police and judicial cooperation to fight international crime. The Schengen area therefore provides better security as well as better freedom for European citizens.
What are the main challenges the system faces?
There are two main challenges: the first is to respond to those countries that want to join the Schengen area, and because we have no internal borders, we have to ensure that the common external borders are well controlled. That means that someone trying, for example, to enter Spain from North Africa is in effect also entering Portugal, France and so on. So we have to trust each other and the main challenge is to be sure that countries asking to join the Schengen area respect all the conditions.
We have to trust their border controls as we trust the border controls in our own country. In my opinion, the evaluation system, which is still intergovernmental, could be improved by becoming a European system.
The second challenge is to increase security at the external borders. This is directly connected to "SIS II" (Schengen Information System - the computer database central to its workings), the second generation Schengen Information System. Today's SIS is a very good tool. It means that when someone tries to enter Portugal, border control can access information available from other Schengen area countries.
That's good, because nobody can enter Portugal if there is a judicial indictment or an arrest warrant for that person, or a suggestion from a police force to submit that person to surveillance. This is vital shared information. So the SIS is working well, but it is not enough.
We want to seriously upgrade the SIS, essentially with two new tools: first, biometric data, in order to fight wrong identification. If we can connect identity documents to the bearer through biometric data, we can solve a lot of problems connected with wrong identification.
With SIS II, we will be able to check if a car is connected in any way, for example, to a dangerous international paedophile network or a terrorist organisation or something similar.
That's why I think the most crucial challenge for the Schengen area right now is to make the second generation of SIS operational. It was supposed to happen in 2007, which is why the EP is very critical of the management of this programme: we are in 2010 and nobody can tell us when SIS II will be operational.
You have been closely involved in Schengen issues in the EP. How would you describe your involvement?
Some colleagues call me "Mr Borders". Since I started in the Civil Liberties Committee I have worked on this, because for me Schengen is the core of real freedom, security and justice. Everything is connected to it. Schengen is successful integration at the European level and the heart of the new space we are creating.
Over time I drafted several reports and then led Parliament's work on the SIS. I think that it was after that everybody realised that I was trying to do an even-handed job. You can see, from right to left - notwithstanding some political differences - that a broad consensus has built up and that most of my colleagues are prepared to follow my advice in this field.
