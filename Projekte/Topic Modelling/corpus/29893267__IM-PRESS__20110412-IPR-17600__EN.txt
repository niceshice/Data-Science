A delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will visit Washington from 12 to 15 April 2011 to discuss several issues on the transatlantic agenda, including the EU-US data protection agreement, the EU-US Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement and the implementation of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) agreement. Cyber security will also be discussed.
Members of the European Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee arrive in Washington on Tuesday for four days of meetings on data protection and security issues. They will take part in a seminar discussion with members of Congress on data protection and EU-US cooperation, which will also cover the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program and passenger name records scheme. There will be bilateral meetings with Members of Congress working on these areas and further discussions on cyber crime organized through the Hungarian Embassy with Congress members. They will also meet officials from relevant departments.
"The EU and the United States continuously enhance their cooperation, both in fighting terrorism and organised crime and in simultaneously protecting the fundamental privacy rights and liberties of our citizens. These goals and values define Europeans and Americans alike. During our visit to Washington, DC, the members of the Civil Liberties Committee of the European Parliament will discuss the proper balance between security and fundamental rights in a number of upcoming EU-US agreements to which the European Parliament will be asked to give its consent", said the Head of the Delegation, Stavros LAMBRINIDIS (S&D, EL).
Other members taking part in the visit are Timothy KIRKHOPE (ECR, UK), Sophia IN 'T VELD (ALDE, NL), Rui TAVARES (GUE/NGL, PT), Axel VOSS (EPP, DE), Jan Philipp ALBRECHT (GREENS/EFA, DE), Carmen ROMERO LÓPEZ (S&D, ES), Agustín DÍAZ DE MERA GARCÍA CONSUEGRA (EPP, ES), Georgios PAPANIKOLAOU (EPP, EL) and Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK).
