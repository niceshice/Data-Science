2006-02-08 - 15:31
The undoubted highlight of the February plenary session in Strasbourg will be the debate and vote on the Services Directive on Tuesday 14 and Thursday 16 February respectively. Plans to facilitate the provision of services in the EU single market could take a major step forward at Parliament, when MEPs will debate and vote on a first reading report tabled by Evelyne GEBHARDT (PES, DE) for the Internal market Committee. On Wednesday, 8 February, representatives of the two largest political groups reached a draft compromise on some of the key aspects of the directive based on a newly defined principle of " freedom to provide services ." The debate takes place at 3pm on Tuesday.
A large demonstration is expected to take place in Strasbourg on 14 February.
On Monday 13 February, the session begins with a debate on a report on welfare standards for chicken farms. MEPs will also be debating the effect of globalisation on the internal market with a call for the EU-15 to open up their labour markets to the 10 new Member States. Michael CASHMAN (PES, UK) will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the confiscation of vehicles by the Greek authorities.
Tuesday 14 February, starts with a debate on the enforcement of the human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements. Catherine Stihler will be putting forward a non-binding report on fisheries, specifically the Shetland Box and Plaice Box, calling for them to be extended for a further three years.
On Wednesday morning, Parliament will discuss the furore surrounding the publication of cartoons featuring the prophet Mohamed. There will then be Council and Commission statements on the confrontation between Iran and the International Community and the outlook for Bosnia Herzegovina.
At midday on Wednesday 15 February, Dr. Heinz FISCHER , the President of Austria, will address the House in a formal sitting.
On Wednesday evening, Mairead McGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE) will present her report on strategic guidelines for rural development for 2007-2013.
On Thursday morning at 10am, the House will vote on its first reading report on services in the internal market. The session will end as usual with three short debates on human rights matters, this time concerning Azerbaijan, Sri Lanka and Guantanamo Bay.

MEPs to tackle Services Directive
2006-02-08 - 15:31
Plans to facilitate the provision of services in the EU single market could take a major step forward at Parliament, when MEPs debate and vote on a first reading report tabled by Evelyne GEBHARDT (PES, DE) for the Internal Market Committee.
On Wednesday, 8 February, representatives of the EPP-ED and Socialist groups reached a draft compromise on some of the main points of this directive based around a new definition of the principle of " freedom to provide services " to replace that drawn up by the Internal Market Committee and the Commission's original plan to use a " country of origin " principle. The text below reflects the position taken by the Internal Market Committee rather than this latest compromise.
A large scale demonstration is likely in Strasbourg on Tuesday 14 February, the day of the debate. MEPs will vote on the first-reading report on Thursday 16 February.
The committee had thoroughly scrutinised the text of the directive, which has aroused much controversy and which even became an issue in the French referendum on the EU Constitution. No fewer than 1600 amendments were tabled at committee stage. Committee members agreed a compromise on several aspects of the directive in line with proposals made by rapporteur Evelyne GEBHARDT (PES, DE). MEPs in the committee accepted the principle of a framework directive rather than a number of sectoral directives. In committee, they agreed on a range of clauses concerning the purpose of the directive, its relationship to other Community legislation (including the directive on the temporary posting of workers), administrative cooperation between Member States and clauses seeking to make it easier for a company providing services to set up shop in another Member State.
However, the agreement between the political groups did not resolve the two most contentious issues: the country of origin principle (by which a service provider is broadly subject to the legislation of his country of establishment and not the country where the service is provided) and the scope of the directive, i.e. precisely which services it will cover.
"Country of origin principle" becomes "freedom to provide services"
The committee changes the terminology of the Commission proposal. The chapter in the Commission proposal named the " country of origin principle " becomes the " freedom to provide services ". The Internal Market Committee defines this principle as follows: " Member States shall respect service providers' rights to provide a service in another Member State than that where they are established. When providing a service, they are subject only to the provisions of the Member State of establishment relating to access to a service activity and to the exercise of a service activity, in particular the requirements governing the establishment and operation of the service provider, his behaviour, the quality or content of the service, standards and certifications ". However, the committee introduces a new safeguard clause: " This does not prevent the Member State into which the service provider moves from enforcing its specific requirements with regard to the exercise of a service activity that are indispensable for reasons of public policy or public security or for the protection of the health or the environment in order to prevent particular risks at the place where the service is provided ."
The committee also says that " The Member State of destination shall be entitled to take supervisory measures ."
Mrs Gebhardt had proposed distinguishing the right to provide crossborder services from the practical exercise of this right. The right to exercise a service activity would be acquired by the provider in his country of origin, i.e. his country of establishment. But the provision of a service in another Member State - the host country - would be subject to the legislation of that State. " I am in favour of a free market in services ", said Mrs Gebhardt, " but labour legislation must not be brought into question by the directive on the liberalisation of services ." On labour issues, the law of the country in which the service is provided must apply. This is a fundamental matter". Mrs Gebhardt was supported by the Socialist and Green groups. However, the Internal Market Committee finally voted (by 21 votes to 16, with 3 abstentions) in favour of a solution closer to the Commission's initial proposal. The amendment in question was jointly submitted by members of the EPP-ED, ALDE and UEN groups.
Scope of the directive
As to the scope of the directive, nobody questioned the exclusion from the directive of public services " of general interest " (something which in any case is laid down in the Treaty). But members of the ALDE and EPP-ED groups strongly opposed a broader exclusion of " services of general economic interest " (those provided for payment by private companies), as proposed by Mrs Gebhardt. According to Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED, UK) "It would be unfair to prevent some private companies taking advantage of the free market on the grounds that the services they provide are of 'general interest'". At the vote, the committee backed this view and Mrs Gebhardt's amendments on this point were rejected by a narrow majority (17 votes in favour, 19 against and 3 abstentions). The committee, in a proposed amendment, explicitly says that the " directive shall be without prejudice to labour law, and, in particular, to any provisions on relations between the social partners, including the right to take industrial action and the right to collective agreements. This Directive shall not affect national social security legislation in the Member States."
The proposed directive covers a wide range of different services provided to consumers and to businesses. Examples of the services covered by the directive are: Business services such as management consultancy, certification and testing, facilities management (including office maintenance and security), advertising, recruitment services and the services of commercial agents. Services provided both to businesses and to consumers including legal or fiscal advice, real estate services such as estate agencies, construction (including the services of architects), distributive trades, the organisation of trade fairs, car rental, travel agencies, and security services, consumer services including health care services, household support services (such as help for the elderly), tourism, leisure services, sports centres and amusement parks.
However, the committee voted in favour of Mrs Gebhardt's proposal that the directive should not apply to certain services including gambling and lotteries, audio visual services including the cinema, professions and activities connected with the exercise of official authority (such as notaries), lawyers and above all health care.
No link to the posting of workers directive
For reasons of legal certainty and consistency, the Internal Market Committee deletes any explicit ink to the existing posting of workers directive. Labour law provisions, says the committee, can only be effectively enforced in the Member State where the work is performed". The drafting of the Commission proposal "lacks the necessary safeguards to serve labour law enforcement."
Following the plenary vote, the Council of Ministers, as co-legislator with Parliament, must decide its position on the directive (which is sometimes known at the " Bolkestein Directive " following the name of the Commissioner who originally presented it in January 2004) and the amendments introduced by Parliament. The text will then return to Parliament for a second reading.

Protection of workers from optical radiation - deal to be approved
2006-02-08 - 15:31
An EU directive designed to protect workers from exposure to optical radiation is set to be approved by Parliament. The Council has accepted Parliament's key demand that the legislation should cover only artificial sources of optical radiation and not natural sources such as the sun. The often heard name "sunshine directive" is thus now completely inappropriate.
The directive lays down minimum standards for the prevention and early diagnosis of damage to the eyes and skin from optical radiation, and for the prevention of long-term health dangers. It sets exposure limit values and requires employers to carry out risk assessments. It also includes provisions on workers' rights to information, training, consultation and health checks.
Optical radiation within the meaning of the directive is any electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range between 100 nm and 1 nm. The spectrum of optical radiation is divided into ultraviolet radiation, visible radiation and infrared radiation. The directive does not cover ionising radiation like x-rays or gamma rays, nor electromagnetic fields such as microwaves and radio frequencies.
Agreement was reached on most aspects of the directive at an early stage but there was one major sticking point at second reading: unlike the Council, MEPs believe national authorities - rather than the EU - should lay down the rules on whether and how employers should assess dangers to the eyes and the skin of natural radiation from the sun, and how they must respond to such risks. The Council wanted to require employers not only to assess the risks but also to set up an action plan if a risk is identified.
The deal approved by the two delegations excludes any reference to natural optical radiation from the directive and thus limits its scope to artificial optical radiation. If the full Parliament endorses the agreement, Member States will have four years to implement the directive at national level.
As to the sources of artificial radiation concerned, such as lasers and infrared lamps, the directive details the measures the employer must take to protect employees. These include adapting working methods to reduce the risks from optical radiation; limiting the duration and level of any exposure; the design and layout of workplaces and workstations; using appropriate personal protective equipment. Parliament agreed in second reading with these points. But MEPs successfully pushed the Council to accept that the Commission should produce a practical guide to help employers, especially smaller firms, to understand the technical aspects of the directive.
Background
This directive is the last of a series of four designed to protect workers from the dangers of various " physical agents ". Previous directives have dealt with vibrations, noise and electromagnetic fields.

Transport
Community licence for air traffic controllers to improve safety and combat staff shortages
2006-02-08 - 15:31
Christine De VEYRAC (EPP-ED, FR) for Parliament's Transport Committee is putting forward a second reading report establishing a Community Air Traffic Controller Licence. Rules on training and licensing of air traffic controllers are to be harmonised. The aims of the propose directive are to ensure high safety standards and make it easier for air traffic controllers to work outside their home country by simplifying the mutual recognition of national licences. Given the shortage of air traffic controllers in Europe - around 1,800 more are needed - mobility of controllers was one of the committee's main concerns. MEPs in the committee back moves to ease restrictions on the free movement of air traffic controllers: from now on, under the principle of "unconditional mutual recognition" , all EU Member States must recognise each others' licences and qualifications, language certificates and medical certificates for air traffic controllers.
Rapporteur Christine de Veyrac (EPP-ED, FR) also underlined the importance of the directive for the Single European Sky, created in 2004, as it facilitates both the establishment of cross-border functional airspace blocks and the provision of cross-border air-traffic control services. At present airspace blocks often end at national borders. One of the objectives of the Single Sky is a safer, more efficient flow of traffic by creating airspace blocks that do not end at national borders but straddle them where this makes operational sense. The Air Traffic Controller Licence is an important precondition for the creation of airspace blocks. Regarding language requirements, MEPs and Council have agreed on an operational language proficiency (level 4) for English, and for a local language where Member States consider it necessary for safety reasons. Moreover, in line with the committee's wishes, Member States are also allowed to require advanced proficiency in the local language (level 5) for important safety reasons: MEPs argued that staff responsible for air traffic control are also in contact with a number of local services (particularly the local emergency services), with whom they must be able to communicate easily. MEPs in the Committee approved the Council's Common Position as it stood, since it takes account of the amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading and of the Commission's amended proposal.

Human rights
Making human rights clauses more effective
2006-02-08 - 15:31
MEPs are to debate an own-initiative report by Vittorio AGNOLETTO (GUE/NGL, IT) on the human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements. It points out that the clause had now been introduced into more than 50 of the EU's international agreements.
Ten years after it was first drafted, it is now time to evaluate how it has been implemented and how it could be improved.
The report notes that many sectoral agreements, such as those on textiles, agriculture and fisheries, as well as agreements with developed countries, still lack the clause. The committee warns that Parliament is "no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause". It points out that, on many occasions, the EU had not been able to respond adequately to serious and persistent violations of human rights and democratic principles. The committee concludes that the EU must draw up new procedures and new criteria for applying the human rights and democracy clause, which must apply without discrimination between States or between their levels of development.
The report also calls for the establishment of human rights subcommittees under EU-third country agreements, to be responsible for reviewing compliance with the clause, monitoring its application and implementation, and proposing actions to address democracy and human rights problems.
MEPs in the committee say that one of the factors which has compromised the application of the clause was its vague language, which did not spell out detailed procedures for 'positive' and 'negative' interventions in EU/third country cooperation - unlike the democracy clauses in the Cotonou Agreements with the ACP States which had been very effective. In order to ensure a more coherent, effective and transparent approach to European human rights policy, a revision of the current wording is indispensable, says the committee. The revised text should take into account the following principles: reciprocity, with regard both to the territory of the EU and that of the other countries involved; gender equality and women's rights; no discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or disability; temporary suspension of a cooperation agreement as well as a "warning mechanism" in response to a breach of the clause; and consultations between all parties.
Lastly, the committee wants Parliament to be involved to a much greater extent in drawing up the negotiating mandate for EU/third country agreements, and insists on the need for it to be a joint decision-maker with the Commission and the Council when it comes to initiating consultations, suspending an agreement or suspending any negative measures already imposed on a country.

Local border traffic: special system for EU land border areas
2006-02-08 - 15:31
At present, there is no common policy regulating the controls of local border traffic in the EU, but following the adoption of the "Hague Programme" in 2004 and the extension of the codecision procedure to certain areas this year, the Commission has drawn up a new proposal to be considered by Parliament.
In a report tabled by Mihael BREJC (EPP-ED, SV), the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs expresses its support for the proposal, on the condition that a number of amendments are adopted.
The purpose of the proposed regulation is to "lay down common rules on the criteria and conditions for establishing a regime of local border traffic at the 'external land borders' of the Member States". The oommittee's proposed amendments include: replacing the "L" visa with a "local border traffic permit" ; to facilitate the crossing of borders at places other than the official border crossing points; to give Member States the right to "lay down in bilateral agreements a maximum permitted length of stay "; and to define "Border residents" as third-county nationals who have resided in the border area for at least a year. The report also points out that there should be no need to "differentiate between the different external land borders as the new Member States are expected to join the Schengen area in 2007" and that the border areas should be defined as the territory within 30-50km of the border line between countries.

MEPs hatch plans to protect chickens
2006-02-08 - 15:31
MEPs in the Agriculture Committee want to tighten up animal welfare criteria for chickens kept for meat production. They spoke out against cruel practices such as de-beaking, suggested a harmonised European system for the labelling of chicken meat for consumers, and called on the Commission to standardize criteria and penalties for chicken farmers who do not comply with EU rules.
In a consultation report by Thijs BERMAN (PES, NL), which now goes before the full Parliament, the Agriculture Committee approves the general rule established by the Commission to limit stocking densities to 30 kg/m2 per unit. However, MEPs in the committee call for several changes to the proposed directive.
The Commission would allow the possibility of a derogation to the rules, up to a maximum of 38 kg/m2, if a number of additional animal welfare criteria are met. While the committee agrees to this possibility, it is proposing a cut-off date of 1 January 2013, from which point on the stocking density may not exceed 34 kg/m2. In addition, some of these extra criteria regarding ventilation and temperature limits would be extended to all holdings, regardless of whether they were operating under the derogation.
Thus, under the amended proposal, all establishments would have to conform to a number of rules: non-flickering light of at least 50 lux intensity on a 24-hour rhythm, relative humidity of maximum 70% (when the outside temperature is below 10 degrees), temperature of maximum 3 degrees more than the outside temperature (when this exceeds 30 degrees), sufficient ventilation, regular feeding times, permanent access to water, minimal noise, dry litter, and twice daily inspections.
MEPs in the committee also wish to do away with the possibility of surgical interventions. Under the rules laid down in Mr Berman's report, practices of beak-trimming and the castration of male chickens would no longer be allowed under any circumstances. The enforcement of all these rules is to be carried out by national authorities "in the form of unannounced spot checks" at least once a year. The cost of these inspections is to be born by the competent authority itself. If deficiencies are detected, the authorities can mandate a reduction in the stocking density--severe deficiencies can lead to repeated reductions.
The committee would like a uniform classification scheme for symptoms of illness in chickens, harmonized penalties for infringements, as well as a common system of labelling chicken meat for consumers. The latter should indicate not only the origin and production standards of the products, but also the stocking density at which the chickens are kept.
Worried about the possibility of lower standards of animal welfare around the world, MEPs in the committee also propose an amendment calling on the Commission to " control, and where necessary, prohibit imports of chickens from third countries which come from holdings which do not observe similar rules on the welfare of chickens for meat production as those to be adopted by the EU ."

Strategic guidelines for rural development 2007-2013
2006-02-08 - 15:31
The rural development policy laid out for 2007-2013 focuses on three axes of measures: to improve the competitiveness for farming and forestry; to improve the environment and countryside; and to ameliorate the quality of life and diversification of the rural economy. There is also a fourth axis which introduces opportunities for "locally based bottom-up approaches to rural development". The guidelines proposed by the Commission aim to establish which strategies should be prioritised in order to realise the axes laid down in the Regulation.
Mairead McGUINNESS (EPP-ED, IE), for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, will be putting forward a non-binding report on the proposal for a Council decision on Community strategic guidelines for rural development.
The committee welcomes the proposal but its report also tables various amendments to be considered. It suggests changes concerning modernisation and innovation in the agriculture and the food chain. In particular it notes the important role of ICT technologies and suggests that spending should reflect this. Correspondingly, it asserts that support for young farmers should take precedence, as they play a fundamental role in "overcoming the problem of ageing of the farming population and in maintaining the sustainability of agriculture" , whilst noting that young farmers should be encouraged to remain in the countryside and farm in "a competitive and sustainable manner". Emphasis should also be placed on retaining existing jobs, not just for the benefit of the economy but also for the benefit of social cohesion and cultural heritage. The report highlights the need for a "targeted response" to animal disease in order to avoid the excessive losses that can come with this, and the need to promote farming practices that support biodiversity and the environment.

Developing the EU Forestry Strategy
2006-02-08 - 15:31
The plenary session will discuss the future of forestry policy in the EU when it considers own-initiative report from Heinz KINDERMANN (PES, DE) for the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee. The Commission is proposing an EU Action Plan for Sustainable Forest Management, which should provide a coherent framework for the implementation of forest-related actions and serve as an instrument of co-ordination between Community actions and the forest policies of the Member States.
MEPs in the committee support the Commission's proposal for an action plan, which should, they stress, be drawn up in close coordination with the Member States and the various stakeholders concerned. The report is a comprehensive analysis of eleven elements of the EU forestry strategy, offering ideas in areas from communication and competitiveness to conservation and protection of both EU forests and tropical forests.

Helping agriculture to cope with crises
2006-02-08 - 15:31
MEPs are to debate Commission proposals on how to ensure agricultural workers against natural disasters and the effects of trade liberalisation. The Agriculture Committee wants to extend the scope of 'crises' to include third country import restrictions and to consider "aid for fuel prices in times of exceptional fuel price rises."
The committee's own initiative report was drawn up by Friedrich-Wilhelm GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (Greens/EFA, DE) in response to the Commission's paper on risk and crisis management in agriculture. It makes a number of general recommendations before going on to look at the three specific policy options being proposed by the Commission (insurance against natural disasters, mutual funds and basic income guarantees).
It criticises the Commission's "one-sided approach" based on compensation and indemnification and calls for a greater emphasis on preventive measures to reduce risks and avert crises, such as the use of vaccination and better surveillance of illegal imports. Moreover, the definition of 'market crisis' should be extended to cover the issue of restrictions imposed by third countries on EU agricultural exports. Common market organisations (COMs) should be maintained in particularly vulnerable areas such as fruit and vegetable production. MEPs in the committee also say that, in view of the widespread removal of duties on agricultural products agreed within the WTO, there is a need to define conditions for market access, as a preventive measure, to prevent economic, ecological and social dumping. They add that consideration should be given to granting aid for the purchase of fuel in times of exceptional fuel price rises, while at the same time encouraging the production of energy crops through increased aid to producers. Finally, the committee wants special attention to be devoted to the position of young farmers, who are especially vulnerable to crises and disasters as they are often deeply in debt as a result of buying their farm.
Turning to the three options set out in the Commission's policy paper, the report acknowledges that insurance against natural disasters was "the most tried and tested tool on the market" and that insurance premium subsidy was an accepted form of aid within the WTO. It points out that the co-financing of premiums, or reinsurance schemes, would require substantially greater funding from the EU and national budgets than the intended 1% of modulation. The Commission is urged to set up an EU-funded public insurance scheme for individual production areas and production methods, as well as a consistent and affordable reinsurance scheme for all Member States under the CAP.
MEPs in the committee welcome the Commission's suggestion that support could be provided for mutual funds for sharing producer risk, and point out that producer organisations were of crucial importance in providing more effective insurance cover through risk spreading and pooling of interests vis-à-vis capital markets and the private insurance sector. Accompanying national and EU measures are needed in the field of tax relief and credit facilities, in order to encourage private investment and contributions.
Finally, the committee notes the proposals on providing general coverage against income crises and says that this should be discussed in the context of the future revision of the CAP. Any such system would entail enormous administrative costs. Rather than developing state-funded coverage against crises, it would be better to ensure that private insurance schemes were reliable and efficient. What is needed is a "rapid and flexible" crisis intervention system.

Fisheries
Shetland fisheries box to be retained for a further three years
2006-02-08 - 15:31
In an own-initiative report on the current restrictions within the Common Fisheries Policy, Catherine STIHLER (PES, UK), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, has welcomed the Commission's decision to "maintain the Shetland Box for a further three years" and to "retain the Plaice Box and associated access restrictions pending further study".
The Shetland Box
Established in 1983, and in the hope of curbing the over-fishing of "species of special importance in the region…which are biologically sensitive", the Shetland Box is managed by a licensing system which restricts vessels of over 26 meters fishing for demersal fish in the area. The five main commercially exploited fish in the box are haddock, monkfish, cod, whiting and saithe, with a disproportionate abundance of mature haddock and whiting. The licensing system restricts the number of vessels allowed to fish within the box at one time to 128. This number comprises 62 British, 52 French, 12 German and 2 Belgian, the allocation of which was "based on the track records of fishing activity in this area".
The Plaice Box
In 1989, the Commission established an area closed to beam trawlers of more than 300 horsepower (hp) or 221kW that became known as the plaice box. The restrictions were implemented in order to reduce the levels of discards of flat fish in the North Sea fisheries. At first, the closure applied only in the second and third quarters of the year, but in 1994 it was extended to the fourth and since 1995, the box has been closed the whole year round.
The report comes after the Commission fulfilled its commitment under Article 19, which requires it to assess the "the justification for restrictions on access to waters and resources outside of the 12 mile zone" . It welcomes the Commission's cooperation with the industry, whilst noting the support for the maintenance of the Shetland box given by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and by the North Sea Regional Advisory Council (NSRAC). It further notes how the Commission's Expert Working Group highlighted the "socio-economic importance of the boxes" and that one of the intentions of the Shetland Box is to "provide protection for fisheries-dependent communities in the north of Scotland".
The report observes that the UK government, along with the German government, believes that any changes regarding the Shetland box are "neither necessary nor desirable" and that "any decision should be taken in the context of future flatfish management and the advice of the National Sea Regional Advisory Council (NSRAC)".
The committee calls on the Commission to make a quantitative evaluation of the likely implications of any changes to the Shetland box and recommends that in the case of these evaluations taking longer than the anticipated three years, it recommends that the current legislation should remain in force.

Energy
MEPs demand speedy legislation on renewable energy for heating and cooling
2006-02-08 - 15:31
The Industry Committee is calling on the European Commission to propose legislation by July to at least double by 2020 the share of renewable energies used in Europe for heating and cooling. Benefits would include more secure energy supplies, reduced demand for conventional energy, a cleaner environment and the creation of jobs in new industries.
Around 50% of primary energy consumption goes on heating. Demand for energy for cooling is also growing. Legislation is urgently needed if the share of renewable energy - mainly geothermal, solar thermal and biomass - in these sectors is to be doubled from its present level of 10% by 2020 and also to reach the target of 12% of renewable energies in total energy consumption by 2010 as laid down in the 1997 EU white paper on renewable energy.
In their report, MEPs in the committee make detailed recommendations to the Commission on the content of such legislation. It would provide a framework for national instruments and would fill a legislative gap, as EU strategies already exist to promote electricity from renewable sources and to promote bio-fuels or other renewable fuels for transport.
The legislation would need to provide long-term investment and planning security, which is crucial for energy investors. Financial incentives would be provided by the Member States, although national support schemes should in the end be phased out. For example, Member States might use tax breaks or direct investment aid or make renewable energy plants mandatory for new buildings. The EU, for its part, could encourage the use of the structural and cohesion funds to support research into the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling.
These proposals were made under a little-used procedure, which enables Parliament to request the Commission to submit draft legislation (Rule 39 of the EP Rules of Procedure - see link below). The Industry Committee's draft resolution still needs to be approved by a majority of the Members of Parliament (i.e. at least 367 out of 732). The committee's text, drafted by Mechthild Rothe (PES, DE), was adopted with 39 votes in favour and only 3 abstentions and so stands every chance of being adopted in plenary.

Petitions
Confiscation of vehicles by Greek authorities
2006-02-08 - 15:31
In a non-binding report put forward by Michael Cashman (PES, UK), the Committee on Petitions is calling for the Greek authorities "to fulfil the Hellenic Republic's obligations under the Treaty and to comply with the rules laid down in Community legislation".
This comes in response to a large number of petitions concerning the confiscation of automobiles suspected by the Greek authorities to be illegally imported. In the event that the Greek authorities fail to respond to the demands of the report, it calls on the Commission to " proceed without delay with it legal action against the Hellenic Republic ".
On the 28 March 1983, the Council Directive 83/182/EEC was implemented. This Directive concerned tax exemptions within the Community for certain means of transport temporarily imported into one Member State from another. The application of this directive in Greece has been problematic, involving complexities relating to the determination of "normal residence" , the penalties implemented in cases of infringement of the rules, and the extent to which the "good faith" of the perpetrator is taken into account. Consequently, there have been "a number of irregularities which have occurred in Greece when the customs authorities, suspecting that the petitioner's foreign registered vehicles were being illegally imported and used in Greece, confiscated the vehicles".
The report opens by expressing its "great concern" that the Greek authorities failed to implement the exemption laid down in Directive 83/182/EEC and points out that the Greek seizure, confiscation, and selling of vehicles is "incompatible with the principles of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights". Although the report acknowledges that it is up to national legislation to decide the appropriate penalty when dealing with "infringements relating to temporary importation of certain means of transport" , the report advises that the good faith of the offender must be taken into account. It also notes that Member States must exercise their power in "accordance with Community law and its general principles, and consequently with the principle of proportionality".

Consumers
More resources for SOLVIT
2006-02-08 - 15:31
Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK), the new chair of the Internal Market Committee, will be putting the following oral question to the Commission:
"The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is convinced that SOLVIT, the on-line problem-solving network hosted by the European Commission, facilitates administrative cooperation between Member States. It is designed to find rapid and pragmatic solutions to problems which arise from the mistaken application of Internal Market legislation by public authorities.
Given the success of the network, which has solved as many as 300 cases in 2004, with a sharp increase expected in 2005, can the European Commission agree:
to increase the human resource allocation substantially above the four officials currently assigned?
to the system's being further developed in order to enhance administrative cooperation?
to publish a report with a view to encouraging greater take-up and use of the SOLVIT system and to submit a proposal which would endow SOLVIT with the necessary status and the necessary financial resources? "
After hearing the Commission's response, MEPs will debate the issue. They will vote on a resolution on the subject on Tuesday. Oral question to the Commission

Better statistics on foreign affiliates
2006-02-08 - 15:31
Parliament will vote at first reading on Commission proposals to set standards for statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates. The aim is to be able to obtain accurate and useful information on an EU-aggregated basis.
In a report by Enrico LETTA (ALDE, IT), the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee supports the Commission's plans, albeit with a number of amendments. These seek to ensure Parliament's right of oversight on implementing measures is confirmed by incorporating the same text agreed with Council and Commission for the Capital Requirements Directive - i.e. implementing powers will be granted to the Commission until April 2008, with a review of the ' comitology ' procedure to take place in the meantime.
On the substance of the measure, many of Parliament's amendments seek to ensure the burden on Member States and industry of collecting data will not be out of proportion to the benefit gained from the statistics. If this balance is born in mind, says the committee, the pilot studies proposed in the draft regulation, should be mandatory, rather than voluntary as the Commission intended.

Parliament set to support state aid reform
2006-02-08 - 15:31
Parliament is to debate Commission plans to reform the state aid rules, with the aim of having less, but better state aid in the future. MEPs will discuss a report drawn up by Gunnar Hökmark (EPP-ED, SE) for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, which supports the EU executive in trying to make state aid an instrument for growth and jobs as part of the Lisbon strategy.
The own-initiative report is Parliament's contribution to the Commission's consultation on its proposals. MEPs in the committee agree that state aid policy needs comprehensive reform, saying that the market economy is the most efficient way of allocating limited resources, so state aid should be a last resort. Welcoming the plans for an economic approach to state aid, the committee calls for this to be strictly defined, notably including a detailed definition of the concept of market failure.
The report says Member States should require companies to publish details of the subsidies they receive "to enable shareholder to better evaluate the real performance of the company." MEPs in the committee stress that aid for innovation can give industry and incentive to invest more in research and development, but warn it should not distort competition, by for example, favouring one undertaking over others.
On state support for services of general economic interest, the committee says that this only counts as 'state aid' when there is overcompensation. It calls for greater clarity from the Commission on the implementation of the Altmark ruling and suggests assessment of state aid to public service companies should be based on the effect on the market rather than the size of the company involved
When it comes to regional aid, the report supports a focus on investments on infrastructure and horizontal aid.
Among other points, the committee also argues that the system should be made less bureaucratic and that sanctions for non-notification should apply to the Member States concerned as well as to the recipients of aid.

Call for EU to vote as a block in the IMF
2006-02-08 - 15:31
MEPs are to debate a call for EU Member States to vote as a block at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This comes in a report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which aims to be Parliament's contribution to the strategic review currently underway at the IMF.
The report, drawn up by Benoît HAMON (PES, FR) says the IMF continues to play an important role, while supporting a re-orientation of IMF policies towards emphasising its core mandate of stabilising global exchange rate fluctuations and as a lender of last resort for countries experiencing serious balance of payment problems.
MEPs in the committee believe that, in the interests of its own legitimacy, the IMF should aim to make the distribution of quotas and voting rights more representative of the international economic situation, enabling more appropriate weightings to be given to developing and emerging countries. They suggest increasing the number and weight of basic votes and a mechanism to allow developing countries to increase their membership shares in the Fund. When it comes to the representation of the EU, the committee says the eurozone countries or, if possible the whole European Community, should find a way to guarantee they will vote as a single block. It suggests the Lamfalussy procedure might be used to define EU positions in international financial institutions.
The report says the loan conditions imposed by the IMF have in some cases been too rigid and not always consistent with local circumstances. It recommends a priority reference to poverty reduction as the goal of all IMF lending to low income countries. MEPs in the committee say the liberalisation of developing countries financial systems should be "gradual, sequential and stable," adjusted to take account of their institutional capacities. They strongly believe "developing countries should not have to open up their markets fully and without restrictions to foreign imports"; instead they should be able to establish protection for certain industries for a limited period so as to permit a steady development. The committee welcomes the IMF's emphasis on improving the levels of education and health in developing countries, while stressing that increasing public expenditure, together with improving governance, combating corruption and efficient use of resources, remains the surest way to reduce inequality of access to goods and to fundamental rights such as health and education.

Completing the internal market essential to meet challenges of globalisation
2006-02-08 - 15:31
MEPs are to debate the effect of globalisation on the internal market, when they consider an own initiative report on the subject from the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, which was drawn up by Edit Herczog (PES, HU).
Noting that the EU, over the past few years, has been facing challenges to retain its position in areas such as economic growth, labour market performance, research and innovation, committee members argue that the key to solving these problems lies in the completion of the internal market, "the EU's strongest asset to maximise the advantages of globalisation". Still, as the Committee noted, a flexible and globally-oriented internal market should certainly go hand in hand with efforts "to deliver growth, jobs, social justice and respect for ecological balance while maintaining [Europe's] values and [its] social model."
In calling for bold steps to complete the internal market the report "applauds those Member States which have opened up their labour markets for citizens from the new Member States" and "urges those Member States which still maintain restrictions in this regard to eliminate existing obstacles to the free movement of labour". The Commission, meanwhile, should develop "efficient and regular procedures " to gauge the effects and implementation of internal market legislation.
Lisbon not enough
Noting the EU's struggle to attain the goals set forth by the Lisbon Agenda, MEPs assert that the Lisbon Strategy, as a general economic plan, "may not be enough to handle globalisation". It is for this reason that the Committee -- citing the Globalisation Adjustment Fund as an example -- calls for "other action lines" to cushion the negative effects, and to take advantage of the positive effects, of globalisation.
Securing the EU's competitive advantage
As Ms Herczog remarked during last year's public hearing on the subject, the EU, if it wishes to compete in the know-how sector, must be able not only to generate, but also to safeguard, knowledge and innovation. Patents, copyright laws and anti-piracy policies are fundamental in this context. To that end, this report underlines the importance of " clear labelling rules and observance of denominations of origin as means of guaranteeing the protection of European goods and values". Intellectual and industrial property rights must be secured, the Committee insists -- through the setting up of patenting schemes or the implementation of effective controls on counterfeiting.
