Citizens' initiative takes one step closer

The much lauded citizens' initiative whereby people can collect signatures to demand a change or a new EU law came a step closer on 30 November when the Constitutional Affairs Committee agreed an outline of how the initiative will work in practice. The initiative is a new instrument set up by the Lisbon Treaty and requires 1 million signatures to become valid.
Some of the outstanding issues were how many EU countries would have to be involved in the petition, whether signatures could be electronic and whether they would be validated when 300,000 had been collected.
The original proposal suggested that signatures should come from a third of member states, MEPs had wanted a fifth of the 27 EU members to be represented and following negotiations with ministers a compromise of a quarter was agreed.
MEPs have also agreed with the European Commission (who are likely to administer the scheme) that it be made as user friendly as possible.
One of the MEPs who has guided the measures through the Parliament is Hungarian Socialist Zita Gurmai who has said publicly that she wants to see "as many citizens’ initiatives as possible".
The report is currently scheduled to be voted during the EP’s December sitting. If the vote sets the seal on an agreement between Parliament and Council, and ministers then agree it, EU members will have 12 months to implement the necessary measures to make it work.
