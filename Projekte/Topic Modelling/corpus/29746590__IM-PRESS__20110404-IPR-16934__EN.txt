In the wake of the recent events in Japan, MEPs on Wednesday afternoon discussed the lessons to be learnt for nuclear safety in Europe. There was agreement on the need to conduct stress tests at EU plants, but some groups criticised the voluntary and national approach proposed by the Commission. Some members held up anti-nuclear posters at the start of the debate to protest against the use of nuclear energy in the EU.
In today's debate on the steps to be taken in the aftermath of the Japanese nuclear accident, MEPs stressed the need to have independent experts supervising these tests. They also called for a greater share of renewables in the EU's energy mix and for increased energy efficiency. Many MEPs defended Member States' right to choose their own energy mix while others expressed concern at the existence of old power plants across the EU that do not meet the safety criteria.
A resolution on nuclear safety in Europe will be put to the vote on Thursday.
