On 9 May 1950, Robert Schuman laid the foundations of the European Union as we know it today, calling for a Europe built on concrete achievements, starting with genuine solidarity. To mark the Schuman Declaration's 60th anniversary, the European Parliament and other EU institutions will hold a festival of Europe and open days in Brussels on 8 May and Strasbourg on 9 May. Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek will be in Strasbourg throughout 9 May.
These open days, which will be celebrated in all EU Member States, aim to bring the Union closer to its citizens and inform them of the impact of European policies on their daily lives. The two open days will enable citizens to visit the EU institutions' premises and debate Europe with EU and national leaders.
In the Strasbourg chamber, over 800 young people from the 27 Member States will be able to debate the European project with President Buzek and MEPs at a special Euroscola session. In Brussels, visitors will be able to take part in debates in the chamber with MEPs and also meet political groups and EP officials. In Luxembourg, a European Parliament stand will welcome the public on the square outside the EU Court of Justice.
Several fun activities (music, dance, children's village) and sports (football tournaments) will take place inside and outside EP buildings in Strasbourg, Brussels and Luxembourg. The buildings will be open from 10.00h to 18.00h in both Strasbourg and Brussels.
