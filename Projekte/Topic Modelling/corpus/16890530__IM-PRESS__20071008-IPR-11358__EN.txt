The European Parliament gives its green light to the EU-US aviation agreement which was signed at the EU-US summit of 30 April 2007 and which the Council endorsed and decided to apply provisionally as from 30 March 2008. The report was adopted with 513 votes in favour, 15 against and 35 abstentions.
The agreement deals with, inter alia
• The possibility to operate flights beyond the European Union and the United States towards third countries ('5th Freedom') and to operate all-cargo flights beyond the United States to a third country, without a requirement that the service starts in the EU (7th Freedom - All Cargo).
• A unilateral granting by the United States to the EU of the so-called '7th Freedom rights for Passengers' to a number of non-EU European countries, i.e. the right for Community airlines to operate flights between a city in the United States and a city in these European countries.
• The possibility for any "Community air carrier" to fly between any point in the EU to any point in the US, without any restrictions on pricing or capacity. This freedom does not exist for the moment.
• Rights in the area of ownership, investment and control of US airlines by EU investors.
• The possibility for the EU to restrict US investments in Community airlines.
• A number of access rights for Community airlines to the US 'Fly America' programme for the transport of passengers and cargo financed by the US Federal government. Such rights have never previously been granted by the United States to a third country.
Parliament has given its first appreciation of the draft agreement in form of a resolution on 14 March 2007. In this resolution Parliament underlined that the issues not resolved in this first-stage agreement should be dealt with in the second-stage agreement. These issues are cabotage, right of establishment and ownership.
Furthermore, the Parliament proposes the concept of 'one stop security' and emphasised the need to reduce the negative environmental impact of aviation on climate change. Parliament wishes to be fully informed and consulted before and throughout the second-stage negotiations by the Commission. The EP underlines the importance of regular meetings between its Members and the US Congress.
Background
Air services between the EU and US presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and the US. These bilateral agreements contain provisions that the European Court of Justice ruled in November 2002 to be incompatible with Community law. Therefore it was decided to create a new legal framework for EU-US aviation relations and negotiations on an Air Transport Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the United States of America, on the other hand, were conducted by the European Commission under a mandate received from the Council in June 2003. This mandate set the objective of establishing an Open Aviation Area (OAA) between the EU and US, creating a single market for air transport between the EU and US in which investment could flow freely and in which European and US airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction, including in the domestic markets of both parties.
