The President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, has welcomed the presentation of a set of 'political guidelines' by Jos√© Manuel Barroso, setting out his objectives and priorities for a second term as President of the European Commission. These guidelines were presented to Mr Buzek by the Commission President in person and are being distributed to the leaders of the political groups.
EP President Jerzy Buzek said: "I strongly welcome the presentation of these guidelines. They provide a valuable point of departure for detailed discussions with the Parliament over priorities for the next five-year term. The political groups will now be able to hold a serious dialogue with the Commission President about his priorities. Mr Barroso's programme deals with a number of important institutional issues - designed to promote closer cooperation between the Parliament and the Commission - which I have raised in our discussions to date."
President Barroso will discuss his programme with the political groups in the Parliament over the coming week. On 10 September, the Parliament's Conference of Presidents (of political groups) will confirm whether to proceed to hold a vote to approve Mr Barroso for a second term as Commission President. This vote is provisionally scheduled for 16 September in Strasbourg.
