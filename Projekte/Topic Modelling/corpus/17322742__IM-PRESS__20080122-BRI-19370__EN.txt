Briefing - 30-31 January 2008 - Brussels plenary session
2008-01-25 - 09:40
Selected highlights of the Brussels plenary session 30-31 January 2008 include:
Wednesday 30 January 2008
The first Brussels plenary session of 2008 opens on Wednesday 30 January at 3pm with MEPs debating the situation in Iran with statements from Javier SOLANA , High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission. On 22 January, in Berlin, the permanent members of the UN Security Council agreed on a draft resolution that would strengthen (and possibly add new) sanctions on Iran for refusing to halt uranium enrichment. This resolution is supposed to be submitted to the Security Council in the coming weeks. The EP will vote on a resolution on the situation in Iran on Thursday.
In a point added to the agenda, MEPs will also debate the Gaza-Egypt border crossing with Javier Solana . The House may also vote on a resolution on this topic during the plenary session in February (to be confirmed)
The House will also debate the US anti-missile defence system following on from the debate on Iran. Poland and the Czech Republic have recently said that they are in no hurry to conclude negotiations on the controversial US missile defence project.
The European Parliament will then debate the most important legislative topic of the plenary which is the accomplishment of the internal market in postal services. The Transport Committee recommends confirming that remaining postal service monopolies should expire by 2011 - or 2013 for some Member States. In a second reading deal with Council, the committee recommends sticking to the compromise already endorsed by the Council on the opening up of EU postal services to competition. The rapporteur Markus FERBER (EPP-ED, DE) will hold a press conference immediately after the vote on Thursday.
Fiona HALL (ALDE, North East, UK, Liberal Democrat) will present her own-initiative report on an action plan for energy efficiency . It says both the Commission and Member States need to improve their implementation of energy-efficiency legislation. The Industry and Energy Committee considers that a target of improving energy efficiency by over 20% by 2020, in addition to any improvements due to autonomous structural or price effects, is entirely feasible technically and economically, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that this objective as well as the climate change targets are met.
Late on Wednesday, MEPs debate the reduction in unwanted by-catches in European fisheries . According to MEPs in the committee, the most sensible way to proceed is by choosing a number of pilot fisheries, based upon the quantity of discards produced or on the conservation status of the species involved. Two possible candidates would be the various beam trawl fisheries and those fisheries that catch and discard cod. Scotland already has a system in place for reducing unwanted catches.
Thursday 31 January 2008
On Thursday , the House will debate freedom, security and justice in its annual debate based on oral questions to the Commission and the Council . The questions include the issue of the UK opt-outs in this area negotiated from the Lisbon Treaty. MEPs will also focus on the programme of the Slovenian Council Presidency. Since Slovenia is completing the EU's first "trio presidency" (with Germany and Portugal), its programme largely consists of the follow-up to the goals set jointly by these three countries.
The House will vote on a resolution on A European Roma strategy following the debate took place in Strasbourg on 16 January 2008.
MEPs will vote on a legislative report from Michael CASHMAN (PES, UK West Midlands, Labour) for the Civil Liberties Committee on a simplified regime for the control of persons at EU's external borders . The new system will enable Bulgaria and Romania to recognise unilaterally certain documents issued by Schengen zone countries for individuals making visits of less than five days. 20080122BRI19370

Postal services: market opening by 2011 on track
2008-01-25 - 09:40
The Transport Committee recommends confirming that remaining postal service monopolies should expire by 2011 - or 2013 for some Member States. In a second reading deal with Council, the committee recommends sticking to the compromise already endorsed by the Council on the opening up of EU postal services to competition. The rapporteur Markus FERBER (EPP-ED, DE) will hold a press conference immediately after the vote on Thursday. In its common position, the Council had incorporated all major elements of the European Parliament's position at first reading. Rapporteur Markus FERBER (EPP-ED, DE) therefore recommends that the European Parliament approve the common position without amendments. There should therefore be a second-reading deal with Council.
Opening up of the market by 2011 or 2013
Among the key points was the date for market opening: by 2011, two years later than the Commission had proposed, with the possibility for Member States which joined the EU after 2004 or with a difficult topography, such as Greece to postpone market opening by a further two years to 2013. The following Member States may postpone implementation until the end of 2012: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. For Luxembourg, the Council agreed with the European Parliament first-reading position which said that Member States that acceded to the EU after the entry into force of Directive 2002/39/EC or Member States with a small population and limited geographical size could postpone to 2013.
Situation in the UK and Ireland
The market in the UK is fully liberalised. There are now seventeen licensed operators in the UK, and these new market entrants are playing a crucial role in sustaining the mails market as a medium of communication.
Liberalisation in Ireland has already commenced and since the transposition of the Directives, the weight limit applying to postal items falling within the reserved area (and therefore not open to competition) has been reduced to 50g from 1 January 2006 with a price limit of two and a half times the basic tariff (currently 55c) for domestic and inbound international. Outbound international mail was fully liberalised on 1 January 2004. The parcels market is already fully liberalised. To date Ireland has adopted a light regulatory approach to liberalisation so as to encourage and maximise the number of postal operators that might wish to enter the market. Competition in the sector is growing and at present there are 31 firms operating in Ireland with a postal service authorisation from the regulator. It is anticipated that with full market opening, many more operators will enter the market, leading to a competitive, vibrant sector.
A letter delivered and collected every day
The text makes clear that, in a liberalised market, letters should go on being both delivered and collected at least once a day, at least five days a week, for every EU citizen, in remote areas as well as cities. The funding for these universal services should be guaranteed if market players prove unable to provide such services profitably. In that case, Member States may decide to set up compensation funds.
The principle of reciprocity
MEPs in the committee also agree with Council on the principle of reciprocity: in order to avoid market distortion and unfair competition, those Member States having opened their markets should be able to refuse authorisation to operators still protected by a national monopoly in another Member State.
Safeguards for postal staff
Social considerations should be taken into account in this process of market opening, say MEPs. Member States will be able to reflect working conditions in their authorisation procedures. They will also have the right to impose conditions on the supply of postal services for non-economic reasons, such as compliance with employment conditions and social security schemes, where these are laid down in law or by a collective agreement negotiated between national social partners.
The rapporteur's reaction
Commenting on the committee vote, Mr Ferber said: "This could be a decisive step forward in a procedure which has started in the early ninety's of the last century. I am very happy with the outcome of this vote. The agreement with Council is a realistic package. I am confident that the January plenary session will give the final green light for a new future of the postal services in the EU".
What happens next?
If Mr Ferber's recommendation for second reading will be adopted, this co-decision procedure can be concluded at this stage.

MEPs to debate with Solana on the situation in Iran
2008-01-25 - 09:40
On 30 January 2008 from 3pm, MEPs will debate the situation in Iran with the High Representative for the CFSP, Javier Solana. On 22 January, in Berlin, the permanent members of the UN Security Council agreed on a draft resolution that would strengthen (and possibly add new) sanctions on Iran for refusing to halt uranium enrichment. This resolution is supposed to be submitted to the Security Council in the coming weeks. The EP will vote on a resolution on this topic on Thursday. MEPs in the Foreign Affairs Committee heard from Iranian nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili on 23 January. MEPs aired their concerns about various topics and Chairman Jacek Saryusz-Wolski (EPP-ED, PL) expressed the committee's view that "many of the Members' questions about Iran's nuclear programme, human rights, and democracy were not addressed."
Last European Council - December 2007
On 14 December 2007 at the last European Council, Heads of state and government agreed the following:
The European Council reaffirms its deep concern at Iran's nuclear program and underlines that the acquisition by Iran of a nuclear military capability would be unacceptable. In this regard, it deplores that Iran has still not complied with its international obligations as reiterated in UNSC Resolutions 1696, 1737 and 1747, to suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities in order to restore confidence in the entirely peaceful nature of its programme.
The European Council furthermore regrets that neither High Representative of the EU Javier Solana, following his discussions with the Iranian nuclear negotiator, nor the Director-General of IAEA Mohamed El Baradei were able to report a positive outcome, particularly in the fulfilment by Iran of the requirements of the UN Security Council.
The European Council calls upon Iran to provide full, clear and credible answers to the IAEA, to resolve all questions concerning Iran's nuclear activities, to ratify and implement the Additional Protocol and to fully implement the provisions of the Comprehensive Safeguard Agreement, including its subsidiary arrangements. It emphasises that carrying out these actions and the transparency measures as requested by the IAEA would constitute a positive step to build confidence concerning Iran's nuclear programme.
The European Council reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution to the Iranian nuclear issue and underline that the proposals presented by the High Representative on 6 June 2006 would give Iran everything it needs to develop a civil nuclear power industry while addressing international concerns.
The European Council reiterates its full support for the work in the UN Security Council to adopt further measures under Article 41, Chapter VII, of the UN Charter and recalls that, following the General Affairs and External Relations Council conclusions on Iran of 15 October, consideration has begun on additional measures that might be taken in support of the UN process and the shared objectives of the international community. In light of the upcoming decisions to be taken by the UN Security Council, the next General Affairs and External Relations Council will decide what action the EU will take.
European Parliament position
The European Parliament's Delegation for relations with Iran travelled to Tehran from 7 -10 December, for the 2nd EP/Iran interparliamentary meeting. The 11-Member Delegation was led by its Chair, Angelika Beer (Greens/EFA, DE).
The Delegation met its interlocutors in the Majlis (Parliament) of the Islamic Republic of Iran (including the Speaker, Haddad Adel), members of government (in particular, Foreign Affairs Minister Manouchehr Mottaki) and senior officials, as well as officials of the UN agencies active in Iran. It also held a dialogue with members of Iranian "civil society," including representatives of trade unions, women's organizations, ethnic and religious minorities, and met Members of the diplomatic and business communities. It visited associations of victims of MKO terrorism as well as of former Members of terrorist organizations.
On 25 October 2007, the EP adopted a resolution on Iran expressing its deep concern about the deterioration of the human rights situation in Iran during recent years. The Parliament appealed to the Iranian authorities to honour their obligations in accordance with international human rights standards and instruments ratified by Iran, by promoting universal values and granting all persons the right to exercise their civil rights and political freedoms.

Security and defence
US anti-missile defence system
2008-01-25 - 09:40
The House will debate the proposed US anti-missile defence system. Poland and the Czech Republic have recently said that they are in no hurry to conclude negotiations on the controversial US missile defence project. In May 2007, the EP expressed its deep concern regarding the announcement by Russian President Vladimir Putin of Russia's unwillingness to continue its participation in the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe. MEPs take the view that this is an inadequate response to the anti-missile system plans and call for the reopening of political dialogue within the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe on security, arms control and disarmament issues.
The House welcomed the initiative taken by the United States for consultations and permanent provision of information about its anti-missile shield and expressed its concern about declarations made by President Putin in reaction to the United States' plans to deploy components of its anti-missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic.
MEPs called on all parties involved to engage in dialogue; calls on the United States to redouble its efforts to improve consultation regarding, and explanation of, its plans for a missile defence system to counter threats from potential emerging nuclear powers, so that both NATO and the EU remain united; demands thorough discussion concerning these proposals, including the necessity, the threat assessment and the possibility of establishing different security areas within the framework of both the EU and NATO. The House also stressed the importance of consultation within the NATO-Russia Council regarding the missile defence system. Council and Commission statements - US anti-missile defence system

Outcome of the Bali climate change conference - MEPs to vote on a resolution
2008-01-25 - 09:40
MEPs will debate the outcome of the recent Bali climate change conference (3-14 December 2007). Parliament will also vote on a resolution on this topic. On 15 December 2007, representatives of the European Parliament at the Bali United Nations Conference on Climate Change welcomed the outcome of the meeting. They also expressed their hopes that the United States would adopt ambitious emission targets in the near future. Most importantly, the EP applauds the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for having secured the best politically viable outcome here at Bali. It welcomes, in that vein, the Bali roadmap as the opening of a process, which will lead us to, and beyond, 2012, with a global agreement to be reached by 2009. Moreover, it applauds the Kyoto signatories’ decision to recognize the target of a 25-40% cut in greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels), as noted in the Fourth Assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Energy
Tackling climate change through energy efficiency
2008-01-25 - 09:40
The Industry Committee is backing the Commission's proposed Action Plan for Energy Efficiency in an own-initiative report. It says both the Commission and Member States need to improve their implementation of energy-efficiency legislation. MEPs in the Industry Energy committee back the report from Fiona HALL (ALDE, UK Liberal Democrat North East), underlining their support for the Action Plan's aim of "improving energy efficiency by over 20% by 2020." The Industry and Energy Committee considers that a target of improving energy efficiency by over 20% by 2020, in addition to any improvements due to autonomous structural or price effects, is entirely feasible technically and economically, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that this objective as well as the climate change targets are met.
Major points from the report, which are proposed to plenary by the European Parliament's Energy Committee, include:
The need for speedy adoption of energy performance standards for key products already agreed, such as air conditioning, boilers, TV set-top boxes;
A call for phasing out of inefficient light bulbs, and of patio heaters. Also the introduction of a 'one-watt' stand-by performance requirement and the ending of non-essential stand-by mode;
Criticism for EU governments which have yet to implement the existing Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (only 5 out of 27 countries implemented it in time);
A call for all new and renovated buildings to be included in a revision of the Buildings Directive from 2009 (rather than keeping the existing 1000m2 threshold);
Criticism for EU Member States which have still to present their Energy Efficiency National Action Plans.
The committee notes with grave concern that implementation by Member States of existing legislation on energy efficiency is incomplete and behind schedule.
Withdrawal of patio heaters from the market
The committee urges the Commission to establish timetables for the withdrawal from the market of all the least energy-efficient items of equipment, appliances and other energy-using products, such as patio heaters.
Drastic cuts in carbon emissions are necessary to prevent chaotic climate change, says the committee, and "the most immediate and cost-effective way of achieving them is to use energy more efficiently" - which is precisely what the Action Plan for Energy Efficiency intends to ensure. More efficient energy use, committee members note, would also reduce the EU's dependency on energy imports. The Committee also backed the Plan's scope and key objectives: to provide EU citizens with the most energy-efficient infrastructure, buildings, appliances, processes, transport means and energy systems, as well as to encourage citizens to use energy in the most rational manner possible.
Inadequate implementation by Commission and Member States
However, the committee criticises the fact that "of 21 Commission actions scheduled for completion in 2007 only three had been fully carried out by 1 September 2007." Member States, MEPs pointed out, have also failed "to prioritise full and prompt transposition of and compliance with energy efficiency legislation."
The committee proposes to "set minimum energy performance requirements for all transport modes"; to ensure that the proportion of structural and cohesion funding spent on improving energy efficiency of existing homes be raised from 3% to a minimum of 5%; and to include binding requirements regarding energy efficiency for all new buildings requiring heating and/or cooling.

Fisheries
Positive and negative incentives for the industry to eliminate discards
2008-01-25 - 09:40
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report reacting to the Commission communication "A policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards in European fisheries". According to MEPs in the committee, the most sensible way to proceed is by choosing a number of pilot fisheries, based upon the quantity of discards produced or on the conservation status of the species involved. Two possible candidates would be the various beam trawl fisheries and those fisheries that catch and discard cod. Scottish government position
The report welcomes the recent introduction by the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Scottish fishing industry, of a voluntary system of real time area closures whereby fishing grounds will be closed for a three-week period in the event of skippers identifying a high abundance of undersized cod. The committee believes that schemes such as this, the first of its kind in Europe, have the potential to contribute to the reduction of discards whilst working with the full co-operation of the fishing industry.
Beginning on 1 September 2007, the Scottish industry, in cooperation with the Scottish Executive, initiated a voluntary system of real-time closures. If on-board observers detect catches of small cod (specifically, 60 cod per hour of fishing) then further samples are taken and, if confirmed, a closed area of 15 miles square is created for a period of 21 days. Vessels from other Member States are encouraged to follow the scheme.
By-catches and discards are a serious ecological and economic problem. On the one hand they are responsible for the imbalance seen in some ecosystems, and on the other hand they have been identified as the main cause of the depletion of stocks, some of them with a high commercial value, such as cod. Discards have been estimated to be between 7 million and 27 million tonnes per year worldwide, equivalent to one quarter of all fish and other species caught.
In a report by Carl SCHLYTER (Greens/EFA, SE), the Fisheries Committee welcomes the Commission's new attempt to stimulate discussion about this serious subject with a view to finally shifting the emphasis of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) so that the practice of discarding is ultimately eliminated.
According to MEPs in the committee, one effective action to reduce discards is a reduction in overall fishing effort, accompanied by an improvement in selective measures. They recognize that "reduced fishing pressure would provide significant benefits for the industry" by allowing depleted stocks to recover and become more productive as well as saving time and effort in sorting the catch.
Incentives for the industry to improve its fishing practices
The Fisheries Committee encourages the Commission, the Member States and other stakeholders to consider the "use of incentives for the industry to improve its fishing practices", mentioning various possibilities for such incentives, including:
allowing more days at sea or increasing the allowable fishing time, for vessels using more selective gear;
providing preferential access for vessels using selective gear to areas that are closed to those vessels not using selective gear;
allowing vessels with more selective gear to fish during times when others are not allowed.
"The industry would respond more favourably and with greater effect to a combination of positive and negative incentives, which should be given an opportunity to produce results", says Carl SCHLYTER (Greens/EFA, SE), adding that "a discard ban should be adopted only after other types of negative incentives have been tried, including timed series of increases in mesh sizes, closed areas and others".
Pilot projects
According to the committee, the most sensible way to proceed is by choosing a number of pilot fisheries, based upon the quantity of discards produced or on the conservation status of the species involved. The pilot projects should be selected in several zones to represent the geographical variety of Community fisheries. Each pilot project must also involve a sufficient number of vessels to cover the diversity of the fishery as well as to ensure good information exchange with others in the fishery.
MEPs in the committee suggest that two possible candidate fisheries would be the various beam trawl fisheries as well as those fisheries that catch and discard cod. While these pilot projects are proceeding, other fisheries should be evaluated for their discard rate.

Statistics on aquaculture production to be improved in the EU
2008-01-25 - 09:40
In a world in which fish stocks are declining and world demand for fish and seafood is constantly rising, aquaculture is becoming increasingly important. MEPs will vote on a co-decision report from the Fisheries Committee drawn up by its chairman, Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR), on a proposal aiming to replace the current Community legislation on the submission by Member States of statistics on aquaculture production, which has been in force for more than ten years. The rapporteur supports the Commission’s proposal, suggesting, however, some amendments to improve the clarity and coherence of the text, take account of the problems faced by some Member States and make provision for information and regular updates for the European Parliament and the Council concerning the application of the legislation.
Mr Morillon considers that the changes introduced should enable the submission of annual data on the volume of aquaculture production to be improved, and that they will improve the accessibility of the requisite information.
According to the Fisheries Committee, in order to ensure a smooth transition, this regulation should allow for a transitional period of up to three years to be granted to Member States where its application to their national statistical systems would require major adaptations and would be likely to cause significant practical problems.
MEPs in the committee also add that within three years of this regulation coming into force, and every three years thereafter, the Commission shall submit an "evaluation report" to the EP and to the Council on the statistics compiled and, in particular, on their relevance and quality. This report should undertake a "cost-effectiveness analysis of the system introduced to collect and draw up the statistics" and indicate best practices to lessen the workload for Member States and enhance the usefulness and quality of the data.
Context
The Community legislation on statistics on aquaculture has been in force for more than ten years. It provides for Member States to submit annual data on the volume of aquaculture production to the Commission. Since Regulation (EC) 788/96 was approved, there has been a considerable increase in aquaculture.
"The current situation in the sector plays an important socio-economic role in several European regions by enabling the development of a processing industry with a promising future", says the rapporteur. "The need for a broader range of data has, therefore, become an urgent one, if there is to be rational development and management within the Common Fisheries Policy".
The need for wide-scale collection of statistical data on aquaculture stems from the importance of having an accurate and comprehensive overview of aquaculture businesses, their cultivation techniques and the different production environments, adds Philippe MORILLON.
The aquaculture sector in numbers
The EU’s aquaculture sector totals 1.3 million tons of fisheries products per year, representing some 3 billion euros. This corresponds to around one third of the total value of production in the EU’s fisheries sector and roughly one fifth of its volume. In some Member States the value of farmed products is higher than that of products landed. In others, aquaculture represents a significant proportion of total production. In Greece, for example, 100 000 of every 200 000 tons of fish are produced by aquaculture.
As well as encompassing important sources of products for European consumers, the aquaculture sector is also a substantial source of employment in regions dependent on fishing.

A European strategy on the Roma people - MEPs to vote on a resolution
2008-01-25 - 09:40
The House will vote on a resolution on A European Roma strategy following the debate took place in Strasbourg on 16 January 2008. Christopher BEAZLEY (EPP-ED, UK, Conservative, Eastern) said in the debate: "This debate has highlighted a number of the problems which the subject we are debating raises. It seems to me, Commissioner, that rather than us devising a strategy and telling others what to do, it would perhaps be wise to ask representatives of the Roma community.
We currently have two Roma MEPs. I remember, too, a very famous Spanish Socialist Member of this House, elected in 1989, who was particularly engaging and informative on the whole question of Roma culture. That culture is part of our culture and part of European civilisation, and reflects what kind of a people we are.
It would perhaps be wise to look at the history of the Roma people, to speak with representatives of the Roma culture and to ask them how we can best further their prospects, rather than telling them how they can integrate into our society and how we can best accommodate their social needs."

Freedom, security and justice - Annual debate - questions on the UK opt outs in Lisbon Treaty
2008-01-25 - 09:40
The House will hold the annual debate with the Council on freedom, security and justice in the European Union, focusing on the programme of the Slovenian Council Presidency. Since Slovenia is completing the EU's first "trio presidency" (with Germany and Portugal), its programme largely consists of the follow-up to the goals set jointly by these three countries. Among the areas on which the Council will focus are:
- asylum and refugee policy, including plans for a Common European Asylum System;
- prevention of illegal migration, including surveillance of the external border;
- legislation on the status of legal migrants;
- strengthened cooperation between EU police forces, including a revamping of Europol;
- the fight against organised crime and terrorism;
- protection of privacy;
- implementation of the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II);
- legal certainty in the area of family law, an area of growing concern given the number of European families with members of different nationalities.
Many areas of freedom, security and justice legislation on which Parliament currently only has consultation rights are due to come under co-decision when the Lisbon Treaty enters into force.
The questions to the Council are the following including one on the UK opt outs on justice and home affairs:
For the proposals currently in the third pillar, is it willing to agree with the EP on a short list of priorities, so that a political agreement could be reached before the 2008 European Council and the formal adoption in codecision between January and May 2009?
Will it inform the EP on the impact of the UK's opt-out on freedom, security and justice?
Will it submit to the EP an overview of the interdependence of the various initiatives and legislative proposals in the fields of counter-terrorism and police cooperation at European level and allow access to data bases and exchange of information in the fight against crime?
Will it submit to the EP a credible programme of operational measures in the fight against terrorism, and in strengthening police cooperation?
For the first pillar domain, is it willing in 2008 and the beginning of 2009 to agree with the EP on measures linked to legal migration policy?
Will it make substantial progress on the proposal for a return directive (COM(2005)0391 - COD/2005/0167) and to strengthen the dialogue between the countries of origin and transit and the EU Member States?
Will it push Member States to provide logistical and human support for Frontex's operations and its so-called toolbox?
And if the Commission agrees with the following:
to have before the end of 2008 a first structured evaluation of the implementation of the FSJA related policies by associating the European and the national parliaments as provided by Art. 8c of the new EU Treaty and by art. 64 of the new Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (which are compatible with the current rules of the National Parliaments Protocol);
to prepare together with the European Parliament and the next Council Presidencies a specific interinstitutional legislative programme for the FSJA area covering 2008 and 2009 by indicating
which measures could be finalised before the entry into force of the new Treaty,
and which ones could be politically negotiated in 2008 but formally adopted in the period between January and May 2009;
to accept as a main rule that the measures that affect the fundamental rights of European citizens should enjoy full judicial control at national and European level;
as a corollary of the previous principle, to undertake in 2008 revision of the texts already in force (such as Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 on the 'Black Lists' or the Mutual Legal Assistance Convention) or still under discussion but which are not bringing a real added value to the protection of EU citizens' rights (such as the proposal on procedural guarantees COM(2004)0328 - CNS 2004/0113).
to inform the EP on the foreseeable impact of the UK's opt-out on freedom, security and justice;
to fully inform the EP on the result of the Member States' consultation on the impact of the EU anti-terrorist measures. Rapporteur Jean-Marie CAVADA ALDE FR Oral questions to Council and Commission

Improving police cooperation among EU countries in crisis situations
2008-01-25 - 09:40
The Civil Liberties Committee is giving its strong support to an Austrian initiative to improve cooperation between the special police intervention units of EU countries in crisis situations. The report gives its non-binding approval to the Council initiative and proposes few amendments to clarify concepts such as what is a "crisis situation" or how can Member States cooperate. MEPs understand that the cooperation of such "special intervention units" should be voluntarily activated under the request of the affected Member State, "in man-made crisis situations presenting a serious direct physical threat to persons, property, infrastructure or institutions, in particular hostage taking, hijacking and similar events".
The Austrian initiative is a complement to the so-called "Prüm Decision", adopted by all Member States last summer to ensure that precise personal information --including for the first time DNA and fingerprints data -- may be exchanged swiftly and efficiently by national law enforcement officers to help combating terrorism and cross-border crime, including illegal immigration. The Prüm Decision included other forms of stepping up border police cooperation, such as "joint police operations", for which it is necessary to refer to what Member States' law permits. Police officers involved in a joint operation in another Member State's territory will carry their usual service weapons and wear their own national uniforms with a distinctive sign and an accreditation document.
In both cases (joint police operations and actions by the special intervention units), it should be the host Member State who will assume responsibility for the measures taken by the officers crossing the border, stressed the report drafted by Armando FRANÇA (PES, PT).
The Civil Liberties Committee underlines that nothing in this Decision should be construed as permitting the application of these rules governing cooperation among the law enforcement agencies of the Member States to relations with the respective agencies of third countries. The purpose of this amendment is the introduction of an express material safeguard against the unauthorised expansion of these simplified rules for cooperation, to the interactions with the agencies of third countries, which might not be operating under similar standards of accountability and democratic control to those existing in the EU Member States - a situation that might result in unwarranted jeopardizing of European citizens' vital interests.

Simplified regime for the control of persons at EU's external borders
2008-01-25 - 09:40
MEPs will vote on a legislative report from Michael Cashman (PES, UK West Midlands, Labour) for the Civil Liberties Committee on a simplified regime for the control of persons at EU's external borders. The new system will enable Bulgaria and Romania to recognise unilaterally certain documents issued by Schengen zone countries for individuals making visits of less than five days. The report states that Bulgaria and Romania are required to issue national visas for entry or transit through their territory to third country nationals holding a uniform visa or long stay visa or residence permit issued by a Member State fully implementing the Schengen acquis or similar document issued by the Member State not yet fully implementing the Schengen acquis (Cyprus).
Lastly, amendments have been made to the annexes to take account of a certain number of changes in Romanian and Bulgarian national legislation as regards visas.
In a second legislative report by Panayiotis DEMETRIOU (EPP-ED, CY), linked to both the first and second wave of EU enlargement (in 2004 and 2007 respectively) and implementation of the Schengen acquis in the new Member States
A series of technical amendments are proposed by the committee in order to align the text with the original Decision N° 896/2006/EC in particular as regards the territorial provisions.
MEPs also reinstate a certain number of original measures from the 2006 decision on the participation of Iceland and Norway to the regime, as well as the non participation of Ireland and the United Kingdom to the decision. Rapporteur Michael CASHMAN PSE UK Rapporteur Panayiotis DEMETRIOU EPP-ED CY A6-0511/2007 External borders: simplified regime for the control of persons based on the unilateral recognition by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia of certain documents as equivalent to their national visas for the purposes of transit through their territories. A6-0509/2007 External borders: simplified regime for the control of persons, based on the unilateral recognition by the Member States of certain residence permits issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein, for the purpose of transit through their territory (amend. decision No 896/2006/CE).

Research and innovation
Attract researchers and stop the brain drain, say MEPs
2008-01-25 - 09:40
The EU has to re-attract competent researchers and prevent a further outflow from the EU, says the Industry Committee in its own-initiative report on the European Research Area. MEPs in the committee call on Member States to abolish any barriers that hinder researchers from entering the EU. They also propose a "research voucher" and postdoctoral fellowships which build on the Erasmus programme to increase researchers' mobility within the EU. The EU is far behind its objective to increase its average funding of research and development to 3% of the GDP by 2010, says the own-initiative report by Umberto GUIDONI (EUL/NGL, IT).
Research and Development Figures
The committee regrets that figures for expenditure on research and development show that the EU average is only 1.84% of GDP against 2.68% in the USA and 3.18 % in Japan; and that expenditure varies from 0.39% in Romania and 0.4% in Cyprus to 3.86% in Sweden. The report underlines the importance of increasing the average spending as well as raising expenditure in some Member States and highlights the importance of better focussing the diverse research and development efforts throughout the Union, especially in order to facilitate the transition towards the digital economy. The committee says that this is fundamental for the creation of appropriate conditions for the achievement of the knowledge-based economy called for in the Lisbon Strategy.
Easier access to the EU for researchers
The Committee for Industry, Research and Energy stresses that a further outflow of competent European researchers must be prevented. MEPs in the committee urge Member States to abolish any barriers that hinder access to the EU for researchers such as insufficient recognition or portability of acquired social entitlements, tax disadvantages, and difficulties in relocating families.
MEPs in the committee also consider it important to align the EU's scientific co-operation policies with EU foreign policy and development aid programmes. MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to initiate actions to increase the participation of scientists from developing countries in international collaborative science and R&D projects and to promote access to existing intellectual property globally. The committee supports the Commission's proposal to create a "blue card system" which would be of "great value for human resources in science and technology".
"Research voucher" and "Erasmus programme" for postdoctoral studies shall promote researchers' mobility
MEPs in the committee propose a "research voucher" which hosting institutions and universities issue to researchers from other Member States thus providing additional financial resources to the actual research that attracts foreign researchers. This system would be an incentive for Member States and research institutions to compete for the most talented scientists, say MEPs in the committee.
As another means of supporting researchers' mobility the Commission and the Member States should consider launching European postdoctoral fellowships and training schemes which build on the successful Erasmus programme.
Fair sharing of knowledge
The committee supports the Commission's approach of "open innovation" for sharing knowledge between public and private sectors. However, MEPs in the committee call for "a balanced and fair system" between open access to scientific results and use of such results by the private sector. They stress that the industry should officially recognise the rule of "a fair and equitable financial reward" for the use of public knowledge.
The Internet opens up "opportunities for experimentation with new models" (such as Open Access), says the report. Yet, MEPs in the committee stress that authors' freedom of choice and intellectual property rights need to be respected and quality peer review must be ensured. Through pilot projects impact and viability of alternative models such as Open Access should be evaluated.
Finally, MEPs in the committee consider it "vital" to establish a Community Patent and a "high-quality, cost-effective, innovation-friendly judicial system for European patents". Rapporteur Umberto GUIDONI GUE/NGL IT A6-0005/2008 The European research area: new perspectives

Regional policy
European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation
2008-01-25 - 09:40
Gerardo GALEOTE (EPP-ED, ES), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development will be asking the Commission the following question on European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation: The European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation was approved by Regulation (CE) nr. 1082/2006 of 5 July 2006. This new legal framework of Community law constitutes a tool intended to promote cross-border, transnational and/or interregional cooperation between EU members, with the exclusive aim of strengthening economic and social cohesion, that is to say, one of the fundamental principles of the Treaties.
Member States, regional and local authorities and bodies governed by public law can take part equally in these groupings, as set out in the non-exhaustive list in Annex III of Directive 2004/18/CE of 31 March 2004. This means a huge number of potential European groupings in very different fields.
The main new characteristic of this regulation is that it gives this type of grouping a legal personality, which has an implicit value and makes cooperation easier within the EU from both an operational and a development point of view. Moreover, this form of cooperation will not necessarily be co-financed by the EU, which opens up the possibilities for joining it.
In order for implementation of this regulation to begin, the Member States should have made such provisions as are appropriate to ensure its effective implementation by 1 August 2007 at the latest.
We unfortunately note that the Member States have not yet adapted their legislation or taken the relevant measures to allow the regulation to be implemented and, as a consequence, this regulation could not possibly have come into force in all the Member States by 1 August 2007.
In view of this situation of flagrant breach of Community law by the Member States, with the consequent economic damage to those affected:
What actions are being taken by the Commission to correct this situation?
Given that it is the responsibility and the duty of the Commission to enforce compliance with obligations derived from the Treaties, will the Commission be initiating the relevant procedure? Rapporteur Gerardo GALEOTE EPP-ED ES Oral question to the Commission
