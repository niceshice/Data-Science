The President of the European Parliament announced the adoption of the written declaration on combating the trafficking of children since more than half of all MEPs have signed the declaration (407 out of 785). The declaration calls on the Member States to recognise the fight against child trafficking as a priority objective in their national child protection policies. The declaration, together with the names of the signatories, are now forwarded to the Council and the Commission.
The adopted text calls on the European Parliament and the Council to provide the necessary resources in the framework of the Commission’s strategy on promoting and safeguarding children’s rights. The written declaration was originally put forward by Marusya Ivanova Lyubcheva, Zita Gurmai, Diana Wallis, Eva-Britt Svensson and Anna Záborská.
MEPs also call on the Member States to continue actively cooperating and exchanging knowledge and experience with the relevant EU authorities and NGOs, in order to prevent and combat child trafficking, and provide adequate treatment for victims of such trafficking.
The written declaration points out that child trafficking is still a persistent problem, with more than two million children annually trafficked for forced labour and sexual exploitation.
MEPs say that the development of new communication technologies increases the trafficking in children, making the managing of this phenomenon more difficult,
Finally, the House points out that national authorities and NGOs in the Member States are still not acting efficiently against child trafficking, due to insufficient cross-border cooperation, lack of specialised training or inadequate implementation of existing legal standards.
The declaration will appear in the minutes of the session of 21 October.
