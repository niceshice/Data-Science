Two people walk past a "closing down" sale sign in a shop. Such scenes are becoming more common With Europe facing the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, MPs from across Europe recently joined MEPs to discuss ways of moving the European economy forward. They rejected protectionism but called for a network of financial supervisors. Below is some of their analysis of the malaise and the steps forward. We would like to hear from you: What policies should Europe adopt to alleviate the economic crisis?
The head of parliament's Economics Committee, Pervenche Berès, who chaired the meeting on 11-12 February said: "Our answer to this crisis needs to be rapid, efficient and targeted, yet at the same time concerted and coordinated."
Almunia: Protect jobs but not protectionism
French President Nicolas Sarkozy recently caused controversy by suggesting French car makers should move back to France from Slovakia. Amid such rhetoric the issue of protectionism was high on the agenda.
Europe's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said "we are determined to protect our economies and our people – but envisioning this protection as protectionism would be the worst response ."
For the rotating Presidency of the EU, Czech Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek said, " protectionism is a huge risk . No one EU country can exist on its consumption and demand alone. Populist politicians fall for the protectionist argument, but we must do the harder job, even to the detriment of our own popularity, explaining that protectionism is the road to hell."
Greek EPP-ED member Margaritis Schinas called for an overhaul of the current financial regulations saying that "many of those causing the troubles jumped the sinking Titanic – but many of the regulations permitting the crisis are still in force."
The Chair of the Italy's Budget Committee Giancarlo Giorgetti said, "Italy is caught up in the fallout of a financial crisis, which it only very marginally helped to generate".
Network of financial advisors suggested
Referring to the €200 billion recovery package agreed by European leaders in December, Mr Giorgetti said the "plan has dramatically highlighted the mismatch between the potential role of the EU in underpinning growth and employment and the lack of adequate financial resources and legal instruments to perform it".
MEPs, MPs and economic experts including European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet are meeting in the parliament in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday to discuss the recovery package. Click below to watch the meeting live.
Ms Berès suggested creating a European system of financial supervisors , following the model of the system of European central banks. She later suggested a "Monetary Fund of the Eurozone" as "an efficient and proactive system of multilateral surveillance".
ECB director Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said the ECB should take on this supervisory role : "Coordination in Europe is credible only if it is based on an institution which offers and ensures confidentiality, independence and efficient decision making. There is such an institution."
Now you have heard some of the opinions from the meeting, we would like to hear from you.
