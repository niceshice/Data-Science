There are already 3 million obese children in Europe and this figure is rising by an estimated 400,000 a year. Bad diet and a lack of physical activity are believed to be the causes. They form a part of the 14 million overweight people in the EU. This condition can lead to osteoporosis and heart disease - which can develop early. Next week MEPs will debate measures to tackle obesity. One option being considered is guidelines to ensure that children exercise at least 3 times a week at school.
A report by Hungarian MEP and former Olympic Fencer P치l Schmitt (EPP-ED) forms the basis of the debate in Strasbourg on Monday 12 November. The report identifies a number of problems across the Union, including;
Less time being available for sport: The average amount of time available is 109 minutes per week for primary school and 117 minutes for secondary school. Both of these have fallen since 2002.
Sport options at school are not diverse or interesting enough for young people.
Often the sport offered is too competitive.
Under-funding of sports facilities.
Insufficient coordination between sport at school and outside of school.
A study commissioned by the Parliament's Culture and Education Committee said that "in some member states the lack of sporting facilities...and PE (physical education) teachers put physical education in a difficult situation". It concluded that "PE is often sacrificed to other academic subjects".
Physical exercise - 3 times a week!
In an attempt to strike a balance between physical and academic education at school the report suggests the following;
School timetables have at least 3 physical activity lessons per week.
Physical education becomes compulsory in all primary and secondary schools.
Better linking of school sports and sports outside school.
Action to include ethnic minorities and the disabled.
P치l Schmitt has his own advice on how to tackle obesity and keep fit: "as a former Olympian, I'd suggest children exercise on a daily basis, taking part either in or out-of-school sport activities, and adults at least 3 times a week".
His report will be put to a vote as a motion for a Parliamentary resolution on Tuesday 13 November. You can follow the debate live online via the Parliament's website.
