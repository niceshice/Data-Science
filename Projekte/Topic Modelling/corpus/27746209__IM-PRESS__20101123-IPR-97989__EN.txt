Parliament approves aid to unemployed people in the Netherlands
Budget
Plenary sittings
2010-11-23 - 14:16
The European Parliament today approved €10.5 million in European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid to over 3,000 people in the Netherlands who lost their printing and publishing sector jobs last year, due to the economic crisis.
Financial assistance to the 3,058 former workers in the publishing and printing industry in the Netherlands will total €16.2 million, of which the EU is to contribute €10.5 million from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). The aid will help them to find new jobs through measures including training and re-training, job-to-job accompaniment and support for business creation. Barbara Matera (EPP, IT), investigated the cases in six reports.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. Its annual ceiling is €500 million.
Referring to the current deadlock in negotiations on the EU's 2011 budget, rapporteur Barbara Matera (EPP, IT) warned that in the absence of an agreement, it will be impossible to fund such applications in future.
