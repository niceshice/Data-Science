MEPs voted to postpone the vote on the resolution on protecting workers against the risk of infection from contaminated needles to the June plenary session in Strasbourg. Every year around a million workers in Europe, mainly in the medical world, suffer injuries from used surgical needles. The consequences can be serious, including infections from HIV or hepatitis B or C. The EP wants to improve existing EU legislation so as to give workers better protection.
MEPs in the committee believe that many of these "needlestick injuries" which occur in the medical world could be prevented if appropriate measures were made compulsory in medical and veterinary services. In a report by Stephen HUGHES (PES, UK), adopted by a large majority, MEPs in the committee say studies have shown that the use of safer needles together with regular training and organisational measures can help reduce the number of injuries. They add that safer working practices and medical devices designed to prevent accidental needlestick injuries would also produce financial savings.
