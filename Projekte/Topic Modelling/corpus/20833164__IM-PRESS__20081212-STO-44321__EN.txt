Dakar, Senegal; many migrants use this road on their attempts to enter Europe "Resolutions for 2009" was the topic we suggested for our first guest photographer project. We had an enthusiastic response with many thought-provoking and amusing photos. We eventually settled on "En route to hope" taken in Dakar, Senegal by Mimi Mollica. Thanks a lot to all those who took part!
Mimi Mollica is a Sicilian born photographer who has been living in London since 1996. His work focuses on social issues, human rights and troubled areas from countries like India, Pakistan, Africa, Cuba and Brazil.
"'En Route To Dakar' depicts a man walking along the motorway being built from Dakar centre to the rest of Senegal. For me it symbolises a journey towards a better life," Mr Mollica said.
"Every year hundreds of Senegalese die in the Atlantic Ocean trying to reach Europe by boat, a dangerous alternative to the far too costly visas to enter the EU. The resolution I suggest for 2009 is for the European Parliament to consider this tragedy and to make relevant changes to the immigration policies and to limit the price for the visas," he said.
We received many great photos, but can only use one on our website, so we have created a special account on Flickr, where you can see some of the other entries.
