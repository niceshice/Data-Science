Â©European Union/Architects:Jim Clemes and Paul Noel A series of crucial votes will be held Thursday morning (25 March) to see who will hold the key posts of auditors for the European Union. The Auditors are elected for 6 years and each EU country submits one candidate. Of the 10 candidates the EP will vote on, seven are new. All have said they will step down if they don't get the support of MEPs this morning.
The Court of Auditors plays a crucial role as the independent watchdog for the collecting and spending of EU money.
Each candidate must be elected individually and the ballot is a secret one. The Constitutional Affairs Committee has held hearings for the candidates and backed them. Spanish Socialist Ayala Sender, the EP rapporteur, said all candidates have said they will withdraw if the House does not back them.
The elections will begin from 1130 CET in Brussels. Watch live via the first link below.
