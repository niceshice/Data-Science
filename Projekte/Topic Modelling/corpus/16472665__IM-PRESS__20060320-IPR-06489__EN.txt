The Culture Committee has given broad backing to a new Community programme designed to strengthen ties and foster a sense of cohesion between the EU's citizens following the low turnout at the last European elections and the No votes in two referenda on the Constitution for Europe.
In a first-reading report, adopted unopposed with two abstentions on Tuesday 21 March, the Culture Committee and its rapporteur Hannu Takkula (ALDE, FI) propose that the terms in the programme's title be reversed by calling it Europe for Citizens instead of Citizens for Europe.
The Commission had proposed three "actions": Active Citizens for Europe, Active Civil Society in Europe and Together for Europe. MEPs wish to add a fourth - Active European Remembrance - consisting of support for projects to commemorate the victims of Nazi and Stalinist mass deportation and mass extermination.
The programme will also cover :
town twinning, including - at the wish of MEPs - twinning of sports clubs, for which purpose several references to amateur sports clubs are added to the legislation;
transnational and cross-sectoral citizens' projects;
support for think-tanks and civil society bodies at European level, such as the Jean Monnet Association, the Robert Schuman European Centre and, following an amendment by MEPs, the Maisons de l'Europe;
high-profile events organised by or with the European Commission.
The cost of the programme for the period 2007-2013 will be â‚¬235 million, which according to MEPs should be regarded as a minimum. The maximum period for granting funding at any one time should be three years, to prevent the beneficiaries becoming dependent on it, says the committee.
MEPs also stress that encouraging active citizenship is crucial in the fight against racism, xenophobia and intolerance, and in promoting integration, cohesion and democracy. In line with this, the programme should also be open to citizens of non-EU countries who have permanent residence rights in the EU.
