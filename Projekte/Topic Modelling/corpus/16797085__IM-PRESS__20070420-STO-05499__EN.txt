Politics and poetry at the hemicycle, India's President Abdul Kalam
Europe's relations with the outside world were in focus yesterday with the Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam addressing the house and a debate on transatlantic relations ahead of the 30 April EU-US summit. In the debate leaders of the main political groups agreed on the need for closer trade relations, legal means to fight terrorism and a commitment to combating climate change. MEPs later gave Dr Kalam a standing ovation for a speech that mixed politics, spirituality and poetry.
Ahead of summit, MEPs debate relations in Washington
There was agreement across the house on the importance of the transatlantic relationship although differences as to how to deal with the US. The stated purpose of the summit is to establish a "single transatlantic market place" by 2015. As well as trade relations MEPs also discussed visa restrictions, the need for a legal basis for the fight against terrorism and the importance of tackling climate change.
Joseph Daul for the European People's Party told MEPs that "we owe a great deal to Americans...if we had not had the Marshall Plan we have not been where we are now." Mr Daul suggested that Parliament's President Pöttering should invite Nancy Pelosi - the new speaker of the US House of Representatives - to the European Parliament.
For the Socialist PES group Jan Wiersma referred to the Democratic Party's control of Congress saying that "everyone can see that a new wind is blowing in Washington" - thus providing an opportunity for greater cooperation. Mr Wiersma also said that Paul Wolfowitz should resign his position at the World Bank over the recent controversy over the promotion of his partner.
Graham Watson for the Liberal ALDE Group told MEPs that the current US Administration had damaged transatlantic relations through overt unilateralism. Brian Crowley for the Union of Europe for the Nations said the economic relations between American and Europe are "the most important that exist in the world".
The debate yesterday morning had begun with the European Council and Commission making statements on the current state of play in EU-US relations. As well as bilateral issues the joint global threats that both sides face were noted as Iran's nuclear programme, Afghanistan and Kosovo. A resolution reflecting the debate was later passed by MEPs.
India's President lauds EU and calls for "World Knowledge Platform"
Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering gave President Kalam a warm welcome underlining his commitment to technology, science and economic development.
In a 40 minute speech interspersed with philosophical and spiritual references, Dr. Kalam told MEPs that India maintains a "unique unity amongst diversity" similar to the European Union. He described the Union as "an inspirational model and an example to emulate for every region in the world".
MEPs applauded when Kalam recited a poem of his own composition, "Message from Mother Earth", part of which states that we should "Never to turn human knowledge, against ourselves or others".
His essential message was the need for three "Indo-European missions" which include:
The creation and evolution of enlightened society based on education and religion. This "universal mind" will set in train economic and social changes according to Dr Kalam.
Energy independence in the face of growing shortages and environmental damage.
A "World Knowledge Platform" that would unite the latest technologies available to mankind put them to use in areas like water supply, healthcare and food production.
As MEPs stood and applauded President Pöttering called it " one of the most extraordinary speeches we have ever listen to" and thanked the Indian President for emphasizing themes of "listening to each other, understanding, respecting and cooperating".
Advanced therapies: MEPs support compromise on ethical issues
MEPs voted to adopt a report which supports putting decisions over ethical issues involving gene therapy firmly in the hands of national governments. Based on a report by EPP member Miroslav Mikolášik the final draft represents a compromise between the Germany Presidency of the EU, the PES group, the Liberal ALDE bloc and the European United Left (GUE/NL). In the debate on Monday, some speakers, including Mr Mikolášik, had opposed the compromise. He argued in favour of a more generally restrictive approach therapies using embryonic stem cells.
For the PES group Dagmar Roth-Behrendt said that the compromise would go a long way to meeting the expectations of "thousands of patients awaiting treatment based on advanced therapies".
