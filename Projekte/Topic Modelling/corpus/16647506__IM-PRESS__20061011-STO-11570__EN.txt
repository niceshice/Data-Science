Europe's 254 Regions: diverse yet vital
Regional policy
2006-10-12 - 17:03
Regional funding: Øresund Bridge and tunnel linking Denmark to Sweden
The European week of regions and cities ends with a ceremony in the European Parliament this week - an annual event that brought together around 4000 participants from 30 European countries. With over €307 billion allocated to investment in the EU's 254 regions over the next 6 years, it's easy to see why the event attracted so many people. EP President Josep Borrell called it "an opportunity for the different levels of authority involved in EU affairs to get together and strengthen ties".
The week of the regions is a joint event, organised by the Committee of the regions, the European Commission and the European Parliament.
How does regional funding affect us? You may have seen a museum, hospital, or a motorway near you with the plaque "co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund”. This is a part of funding for the regions known as "Structural Funds" - the aim of which is to help "Convergence, Competitiveness, Employment and Territorial Cooperation".
There is also the European Social Fund which deals with "Convergence and Employment" and the Cohesion Fund which funds environment and transport projects in some of the poorer countries in the EU. Finally there is a new fund called the European grouping of territorial co-operation which encourages cooperation in regions that cross borders and may suffer from high unemployment
Regional Policy in the EP
Regions are important for the Parliament, explains Spanish MEP Gerardo Galeote, chair of Parliament's Regional Development Committee: "Parliament's budgetary powers enable it, jointly with the Council of Ministers, to fix the total amounts that can be spent and also to lay down rules...defining which regions are eligible and how funding provided should be invested."
Among some of the other events related to regional policy in the EP was an Inter-parliamentary meeting on "Regional policy -from the Pre-Accession Programmes to the Structural Funds" on 9-10 October, where members of parliaments from Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Croatia shared their experiences regarding the pre-EU accession assistance programmes from which they benefit.
And on 5 October, at a joint public hearing, former Regional Policy Commissioner Michel Barnier outlined to MEPs his proposals for "Europe aid", a European Civil Protection Force to be based in Brussels and designed to bring together existing national civil protection forces under one umbrella, in order to enhance the efficiency with which the EU can respond to catastrophes.
