This was cold-blooded murder, striking at the fundamental values of democratic societies, an act of cowardice, xenophobia and hatred deserving the strongest condemnation, he said, noting that the victims had been young people who dreamed of a future in public service.
Neither was it an "external" threat - unlike the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks on New York, the Oslo murderer, Anders Behring Breivik, was a brutal local fanatic, noted Mr Buzek, stressing the need constantly to integrate citizens in society, so that all feel valued and genuinely united in diversity.
Noting that Norway is the home of Nobel peace prize, and lends its support to international peace-keeping operations in the world's most unstable regions, Mr Buzek also stressed the need to co-operate with all states struggling with terrorism, which, in the internet age, knows no borders.
"Terrorism will never change Europe's system of values. We shall cherish and safeguard it, because it is part of our European heritage", he concluded, conveying Parliament's condolences to the victims' families and friends.
Mr Buzek's wishes were echoed by speakers for Parliament's political groups, and followed by a minute of silence.
