Monday 23 April
The session starts with a debate on payment services in the internal market . MEPs are to debate and vote on the legal framework designed to make cashless payments – such as card transactions, bank transfers and direct debits – simpler and cheaper with the creation of a single European payments area. An informal deal with the Council means the measure should be adopted at this first reading stage, giving the banking industry the time it needs to meet its 2010 target.
Following this, MEPs will debate and vote on a draft regulation on advanced therapy and medicinal products designed to foster gene therapy , somatic cell therapy and tissue engineering. MEPs in the Environment and Health Committee support the draft text but are calling for guarantees regarding the products and techniques used, plus extra support for smaller companies working in this field. The vote takes place on Wednesday.
The House will turn its attention to the enforcement of intellectual property rights . Parliament will be asked to approve the first EU directive aiming at harmonising national criminal law when a first-reading report on legislation imposing criminal sanctions for the infringement of intellectual property rights comes up for a plenary vote. The vote takes place on Wednesday.
Tuesday 24 April
Tuesday starts with a debate on the EU budget discharge for 2005 . MEPs on the Budgetary Control committee have relaunched the idea of "national declarations." They are demanding that EU Member States take responsibility for co-managing Community funds, alongside the European Commission. Another idea from the 2005 discharge exercise is to look at the cost/benefit ratio of Community spending audits, which MEPs would like to see rationalised.
Tuesday also sees MEPs debating that progress that Croatia has made towards accession to the EU . Croatia, a candidate country for accession to the EU since October 2005, has made major progress in its preparations, according to MEPs. However, the EP Foreign Affairs Committee believes it must make further efforts in areas such as cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), reform of the judiciary and the transition to a market economy.
MEPs then turn their attention to combating HIV/AIDS within the EU and in the neighbouring countries . In an own-initiative report for the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee, MEPs stress the need to renew efforts to combat AIDS, not only within the EU but in neighbouring countries, too.
Tuesday evening is dedicated to the third maritime safety package . The Transport Committee is backing measures put forward by the European Commission to protect Europe against maritime accidents and pollution. This "third maritime safety package" seeks to promote healthy competition between shipping operators who comply with international rules on safety and compensation.
The Commission will make a statement on Galileo - the European Satellite Navigation System on Tuesday evening. MEPs will vote on a resolution on Wednesday.
Wednesday 25 April

At midday on Wednesday, the President of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will address MEPs in a formal sitting.
On Wednesday, the House will vote on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents to set up a new Temporary Committee on Climate Change.
Simon Coveney (EPP-ED, IE) will lead the a debate on human rights ion the world and the EU's policy on the matter .

2007-04-18 - 17:46
The President of India, Dr A.P.J. ABDUL KALAM, will address the House in a formal sitting on Wednesday at midday. Dr Abdul Kalam is the first President of India to address the European Parliament in a formal sitting. The European Parliament has recently set up an interparliamentary delegation for relations with India which is chaired by Neena GILL (PES, UK). The European Parliament decided to split the original delegation for South Asia into three, one for India, one for Afghanistan and one for the rest of South Asia.
The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert PÖTTERING (EPP-ED, DE), has described the forthcoming visit of President A P J Abdul Kalam to the European Parliament as "very important." "I think it is very important that the President of India comes to the European parliament because we want to have good relations between the European Parliament and India so the President of India is most welcome."
Born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, specialized in Aeronautical Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology. Dr. Kalam made a significant contribution as Project Director to develop India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully injected the Rohini satellite into near earth orbit in July 1980 and made India an exclusive member of Space Club. He was responsible for the evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle programme, particularly the PSLV configuration. After working for two decades in ISRO and mastering launch vehicle technologies, Dr. Kalam took up the responsibility of developing Indigenous Guided Missiles at Defence Research and Development Organisation as the Chief Executive of Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). He was responsible for the development and operation of AGNI and PRITHVI Missiles and for building indigenous capability in critical technologies through networking of multiple institutions. He was the Scientific Adviser to Defence Minister and Secretary, Department of Defence Research & Development from July 1992 to December 1999.
As Chairman of Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC) and as an eminent scientist, he led the country with the help of 500 experts to arrive at Technology Vision 2020 giving a road map for transforming India from the present developing status to a developed nation. Dr. Kalam has served as the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India, in the rank of Cabinet Minister, from November 1999 to November 2001 and was responsible for evolving policies, strategies and missions for many development applications. Dr. Kalam was also the Chairman, Ex-officio, of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet (SAC-C) and piloted India Millennium Mission 2020.
Dr. Kalam took up academic pursuit as Professor, Technology & Societal Transformation at Anna University, Chennai from November 2001 and was involved in teaching and research tasks. Above all he took up a mission to ignite the young minds for national development by meeting high school students across the country.
In his literary pursuit four of Dr. Kalam's books - "Wings of Fire", "India 2020 - A Vision for the New Millennium", "My journey" and "Ignited Minds - Unleashing the power within India" have become household names in India and among the Indian nationals abroad. These books have been translated into many Indian languages.
Dr. Kalam is one of the most distinguished scientists of India with the unique honour of receiving honorary doctorates from 30 universities and institutions. He has been awarded the coveted civilian awards - Padma Bhushan (1981) and Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the highest civilian award Bharat Ratna (1997). He is a recipient of several other awards and Fellow of many professional institutions.

EU record on human rights protection in 2006 under scrutiny
2007-04-18 - 17:46
The House will debate and vote on the Foreign Affairs Committee's draft annual report on human rights in the world. Focusing on the situation in 2006, the report looks at EU policies on breaches of human rights, criticises EU action in this area and makes a number of recommendations. China, Iran, Russia and Sudan are among countries singled out for criticism. The own-initiative report, drawn up by Simon COVENEY (EPP-ED, IE), says China 's human rights record is still a matter of "serious concern" and should thus "receive more focus in the build-up to the Beijing Olympic games". Members urge the Council and Commission "to raise the question of Tibet" in talks with the Beijing government. The Union's trade relations with Beijing, they add, should be contingent upon human rights reform.
Expressing its "deep concern regarding the deterioration of the human rights situation" in Iran the committee "calls on the Council to express concern [...] in all its contacts with the Iranian government". It also calls on the Commission to use the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) to promote cooperation with Iranian civil society.
The committee strongly criticises the Russian government, "regretting" that the EU has had "only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues" -- such as the situation in Chechnya, the treatment of human rights defenders, and freedom of expression. It deplores legislation limiting the activities of NGOs. It is "appalled" at the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and expects Russia to take better measures "to protect freedom of expression and the security of journalists". There is also concern about allegations of surrounding the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and of the mistreatment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky in prison. The committee "urges the Commission and Council to raise such cases with the Russian authorities at the highest level and in the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia".
"Regretting" that the EU has not taken "more unilateral action" to persuade the Sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in Darfur, the report urges the EU to back "an international peacekeeping force" and "the enforcement of the no-fly zone over Darfur". The Council, it goes on to say, should agree "a plan of specific, targeted sanctions to be imposed on the Khartoum regime [...] in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community."
Other countries in the spotlight
The committee report also recognises attempts to set up a human rights dialogue with Uzbekistan , but considers that such a dialogue should not automatically "lead to the lifting of sanctions [...] if no progress is made in the area of human rights and democracy". It is concerned with the "limited progress" on human rights issues in Turkey and encourages the Ankara government to change Article 301 of the country's Penal Code.
The committee urges the adoption of "more effective and targeted sanctions" against the government of Myanmar in light of the deteriorating human rights situation in the country. It also proposes "the expansion of the temporary international mechanism and a continuing pro-active search for a satisfactory context for a resumption of direct aid" to the Palestinian territories.
The Commission is urged “to review its policy tools vis-àvis Libya ” in light of Tripoli’s failure to ensure a fair trial for five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor accused of intentionally infecting children with the AIDS virus. And the the Council and the Commission are pressed to urge the US government to “charge or release” Guantanamo detainees “in accordance with international law”.
The committee expresses "strong disapproval" of US efforts "to actively prevent other countries from ratifying the Rome Statute [of the ICC]" and urges the Czech Republic, "as the only remaining EU Member State not have ratified the Statute, to do so without delay".
It also points to "the need to support the [ Belarusian ] political opposition, which is a target of repression".
Criticism of EU action on human rights
The report is critical of some EU activity in the area of human rights. It asks the Council to explain “how it was possible for Belarus to be elected onto the Governing Body of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in June 2005” – this, in spite of the fact that “four major EU countries are permanent members of that Governing Body.” It also notes “with total stupefaction” the provisional suspension by ECHO of humanitarian aid for Iraq , despite “the disastrous situation afflicting the suffering Iraqi people and Iraqi refugees."
On immigration , the committee notes that the Union, in its texts, attempts “to link immigration and development and ensure that the fundamental rights of immigrants are respected”. However, “the reality on the ground gives the lie to the texts”: readmission agreements are being concluded with third countries “that do not have the legal and institutional machinery needed in order to handle the readmission of nationals and protect their rights.
MEPs note that although the new United Nations Human Rights Council “has the potential to develop into a valuable framework for the EU's multilateral human rights efforts", it has proven to be "ineffectual in responding appropriately to human rights crises" due to "the use of the UNHRC by many states as a forum for political pressure instead of the promotion of human rights". The committee urges Member States “not to support” countries which have been shown to commit “gross and systematic” human rights violations as candidates for high-ranking positions in international forums.
Supporting human rights defenders
The report includes a series of recommendations to the Council and Commission. Both institutions, it insists, should raise the situation of human rights defenders systematically in all political dialogues. EU missions ought to “reach out to local human rights defenders in a more proactive manner”, while the Council should take steps "to facilitate the issuing of visas for all human rights defenders".
Future Council presidencies are asked to report back to Parliament on how its concerns have been taken into account. Rapporteur Simon COVENEY EPP-ED IE A6-0128/2007 Human Rights in the world 2006 and the EU's policy on the matter Procedure : own-initiative

Debate on a moratorium on the death penalty
2007-04-18 - 17:46
MEPs will debate the topic of a moratorium of the death penalty after hearing statements from the Council and the Commission. The House will also vote on a resolution on the topic. On 1 February, MEPs adopted a joint resolution with 591 votes in favour, 45 against and 31 abstentions on the initiative in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty. The resolution says that Parliament is deeply concerned by the fact that national laws still exist, or have been reintroduced, in dozens of countries around the world, providing for the death penalty and the execution of thousands of human beings each year.
The European Union campaigns towards the universal abolition of the death penalty. This stance is rooted in the belief in the inherent dignity of all human beings and the inviolability of the human person, regardless of the crime committed. Council and Commission statements

The House will debate homophobia in Europe after hearing statements from the Commission and the Council. MEPs will also vote on a resolution on this topic. On 18 January 2006, MEPs adopted a resolution on homophobia in Europe which strongly condemned any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation;
The resolution called on Member States to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people are protected from homophobic hate speech and violence and ensure that same-sex partners enjoy the same respect, dignity and protection as the rest of society;
The House also urged Member States and the Commission firmly to condemn homophobic hate speech or incitement to hatred and violence, and to ensure that freedom of demonstration – guaranteed by all human rights treaties - is respected in practice. Council and Commission statements

Croatia: good progress towards accession and some issues remain
2007-04-18 - 17:46
Croatia, a candidate country for accession to the EU since October 2005, has made major progress in its preparations, according to MEPs. However, the EP Foreign Affairs Committee believes it must make further efforts in areas such as cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), reform of the judiciary and the transition to a market economy. In an own-initiative report by Hannes SWOBODA (PES, AT), for the Foreign Affairs Committee, MEPs in the committee "congratulate the Croatian authorities for the rapid progress made so far in accession negotiations". They stress that key pieces of legislation in crucial areas such as public administration, the administration of courts and anti-corruption policy have already been adopted. This central European country of less than 4.5 million inhabitants is thus on course to become a member of the European Union once the accession criteria are met and negotiations are completed, thus validating the argument that the future of the western Balkans lies within the EU.
Environmental standards and market economy
Nevertheless, the Foreign Affairs Committee exhorts Croatia to make further efforts on several fronts. It must first strengthen its capacity to implement Community environmental legislation. The application of the Aarhus Convention on public access to environmental information and the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol on the reduction of greenhouse gases are among the top priorities.
MEPs in the committee also point out that having "an open, competitive market economy is a fundamental requirement for EU membership". Croatia must thus comply with the agreed targets for the sale of "minority and majority state-owned interests in companies" and for the reduction of state subsidies in the shipbuilding and steel industries in particular. The committee appeals to Croatia to authorise the acquisition of real estate by EU nationals, with the exception of the exempted areas.
Cooperation with ICTY and judicial reform
In addition, the committee calls on Croatia to cooperate fully with the ICTY. Croatia's institutions and political parties should counteract the public's perception of the ICTY, say MEPs, who deplore the Government's offer to support the defence costs of Croatian army generals.
MEPs in the committee also attack the "persisting bias amongst some judicial staff against non-Croatian nationals" and the insufficient protection of witnesses against intimidation. They point out that thorough reform of the judicial system and police are requirements for Croatia's accession. The reform of procedures for appointing judicial staff is expected to provide "sufficient guarantees for a professional and independent judiciary", while a recent amendment of the Courts Act introduces an obligation for judges to declare any interests and the possibility of transferring them to overburdened courts.
Integration of minorities, frontier with Slovenia
Among other points raised by MEPs in the committee are the integration of minorities into everyday life and the idea of including in pension calculations the years worked by people who lived in the Republika Srpska Krajina during the conflict.
MEPs in the committee also urge that Croatia resolve the issue of its frontier with Slovenia in line with conclusions of the European Council of June 2004, which notes Croatia's decision not to apply to the EU Member States any aspect of the Protected Ecological and Fisheries zone.
Lastly, the Foreign Affairs Committee voices concern at the flagging public support for EU accession in Croatia and welcomes the fact that the Government and the opposition are joining forces in explaining to the public the economic, political, social and cultural benefits resulting from the accession process.

Economic and monetary affairs
Simpler, cheaper cross-border payments move closer
2007-04-18 - 17:46
MEPs are to vote on the legal framework designed to make cashless payments – such as card transactions, bank transfers and direct debits – simpler and cheaper with the creation of a single European payments area. An informal deal with the Council means the measure should be adopted at this first reading stage, giving the banking industry the time it needs to meet its 2010 target. Although cash in the euro area has been the same since the euro notes and coins were introduced in 2002, non-cash payments still mostly rely on national systems, which can make cross-border payments slower and more expensive than national ones. Payment card systems are also national, which means consumers cannot always use their ordinary payments cards when they travel abroad. Individuals who regularly need to make payments in another country, because they have a holiday home or children studying abroad, for example, usually need to open a second bank account in that country. The same restrictions make cross-border business more expensive and complex for companies.
The European payments industry – banks, clearing organisations and others – have committed themselves, with the EU’s support, to changing all of this by 2010. The single European payment area project should mean that bank transfers, direct debits and similar payments will be made through a new European system, with domestic and cross-border transactions being made in the same way at the same speed. It will also mean payment card systems converging on a common standard, so that cards from all over Europe will be accepted all over Europe, without extra fees or technical barriers. Altogether, since the European and domestic systems will be the same, there should no longer be a need to have a second account in another country. There will be less fuss and lower costs for businesses and consumers alike, and, while there be transitional costs for the banking sector, in the medium term they too should see lower running costs and be able to offer new products.
All this can only happen if the national laws governing payment systems are adjusted to provide a common framework, and that is what is proposed in the Payment Services Directive which is now before Parliament. MEPs will consider a report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, drawn up by Jean-Paul GAUZÉS (EPP-ED, FR) on the issue. This was adopted by the committee last September, but Parliament has delayed putting it to a plenary vote in the hope of reaching a first reading agreement with the Council and completing the legislative process quickly. It took until 27 March 2007 for the Member States to reach agreement in the Council on a text; one of the main points at issue had been the extent to which capital requirements and other supervisory instruments imposed on banks should also apply to non-bank payment institutions.
When the directive comes to the vote, MEPs will first vote on an amendment replacing the entire text with a compromise text worked out between the rapporteur and Council representatives. This already has the political support of the Council, so if it is adopted, the legislative process will be completed at this first reading stage.
Among the points set out in the compromise text are:
the creation in European law of a new class of service provider, "payment institutions" which, essentially just process payments and do not take deposits in the way banks do;
capital requirements and registration conditions to be imposed on these payment institutions are set out, with the provision that Member States may waive most of these for smaller-scale service providers (those dealing with transactions worth less that 3 million euro per month);
payments should arrive at the latest the next working day, where these are made in euro, or are domestic payments made in the national currency of a Member State not in the euro area, or payments involving a single conversion between the euro and the national currency of a Member State not in the euro area;
charges, where these are levied, will normally be on a shared basis with the payer and payee each paying the charge levied by their own service provider, but it is made clear that charges can be set at zero, or that all charges could be levied on the payee (as is often the case with merchants accepting card payments);
It also sets out the rights and obligations of payment service providers and their customers. Rapporteur Jean-Paul GAUZÈS EPP-ED FR A6-0298/2006 Payment services in the internal market Procedure: Codecision (1st reading)

Governments urged to reduce public debt and deficits

A report from the Economics Committee strongly backs a strict application of the Stability and Growth Pact and calls for renewed efforts by Member States to use the current upswing in the economy to prepare public finances for the challenges of the future, notably an ageing population. The annual own-initiative report on public finances in the Economic and Monetary Union, drawn up by Kurt LAUK (EPP-ED, DE), welcomes the “considerable effort” made by many Member States to meet their Stability Pact obligations but expresses concern at the implementation of the preventive arm of the pact, notably in those countries which have not balanced their public finances. It says a lenient application of the pact could “pose a serious threat to balanced public finances and employment opportunities.” Violations of the pact “could ultimately undermine the common monetary policy and add tot he pressure to increase interest rates.”
Looking further ahead, the committee is “alarmed” by the “dramatic increase in age-related expenditure” projected by the Commission and is concerned that six Member States are considered to face a high risk to the long term stability of their public finances, ten a medium risk and only nine a low risk.
MEPs in the committee urge that reduction of public debate be accelerated during economic upturns, avoiding pro-cyclical measures, with structural and tax reforms to improve the economic performance of the Member States. They encourage governments to conduct the necessary reforms of the labour market and services sector, and to reduce the administrative burden on business. They call for structural reforms and additional measures permanently to improve the investment climate and boost investment.
The report warns Member States to present statistics “of a high standard” to the Commission, and urges the Commission “to check vigorously the quality of statistics reported” to them, and take penalty measures where necessary to ensure improvements.
Finally, MEPs in the committee deplore the lack of policy coordination in the euro zone and draw attention to the divergence in fiscal policies of the zone’s Member States. They are concerned about the possible antagonistic effects of such a lack of cooperation.

Damages actions for breaches of antitrust rules
2007-04-18 - 17:46
MEPs will debate how far private court actions for damages incurred as a result of breaches of competition law could improve the EU’s competitive environment and what steps should be taken to encourage them. This comes as they consider their response to a Commission discussion document on the issue. In a report drawn up by Antolin Sánchez Presedo (PES, ES), the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee says that such damages actions – by both victims and representatives of the public interest – should be facilitated. Since the aim should be to promote competition rather than just increase litigation, out-of-court settlements and plea agreements should be promoted.
MEPs in the committee suggest that if private actions of this sort are complementary with the existing public enforcement of competition rules, then the latter could become more strategic and selective, focussing on the most important and significant cases.
The report urges Member States to accept that a final finding of infringement by a national competition authority would constitute prima facie proof of fault in civil proceedings. Damages should usually be compensatory – i.e. not exceeding the damage and losses suffered, though in the case of cartels, MEPs in the committee suggest the damages could be doubled on a discretionary basis.
It will, says the committee, be necessary to have a mechanism for dealing with multiple small claims and judicial authorities should be able to take account of the different economic situation of the parties The Commission is asked to work with Member States to mitigate obstacles to citizens taking out cross-border cases.

Purchasing power parity statistics
2007-04-18 - 17:46
MEPs will vote on a first reading report on a proposal to create a legal framework for the EU’s gathering of data for the calculation of purchasing power parities, which allow direct comparisons to be made between GDP levels of the Member States by eliminating the effect of price differences on the statistics. In a report drawn up by Sharon BOWLES (ALDE, UK), the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee is proposing a number of technical amendments to the text, along with a provision that the EU budget should finance up to 70 per cent of eligible costs to Member States of collecting the necessary data.

Fresh boost needed for fight against AIDS
2007-04-18 - 17:46
Have the therapies that prolong the lives of AIDS patients (but still fail to cure them) led Europe to become complacent? Anyone might think so, as least so far as gay men are concerned. In recent years there has been an upturn in the number of infections in Europe. Half the new cases are people under 25 years old. MEPs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety firmly support a new action plan proposed by the European Commission. In an own-initiative report by Georgs Andrejevs (ALDE, LV) for the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee, MEPs stress the need to renew efforts to combat AIDS, not only within the EU but in neighbouring countries, too.
Epidemic
Europe's figures are low compared with those of sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of the world's 40 million people with the infection are to be found. However, the numbers in Europe are still worrying given our potential for prevention and information.
In 1998, western Europe diagnosed 42 new infections for every million inhabitants. In 2006 the proportion reached 74 - nearly double - or 26,000 new cases a year, in addition to the 700,000 already infected. However, the resurgence is even more spectacular in the neighbouring countries of eastern Europe and central Asia, where around 270,000 new cases were recorded in 2006 alone, of which 90% were in Russia and Ukraine.
Received ideas
According to a Eurobarometer survey in February 2006, 45% of EU citizens still believe that the disease can be caught by drinking from the glass of a person who has AIDS or is HIV-positive. This shows how much information work still needs to be done, both to spell out the real risk factors and to combat discrimination.
56% of new cases in the EU are heterosexuals, of whom three quarters are immigrants or migrants, often infected in countries where the disease is widespread. The number of new cases among intravenous drug users is declining, which seems to confirm the effectiveness of programmes to provide sterile syringes and needles. However, new cases are growing among men who have had sexual relations with other men.
Multi-targeting information campaigns
MEPs in the committee are calling for information and prevention campaigns targeted at high-risk groups, notably migrants and immigrants, and sex workers and their clients. They want to see measures to promote condoms, drug substitution treatments, sterile needle and syringe supplies, voluntary screening, health programmes for women, simultaneous programmes to combat AIDS and tuberculosis (a third of HIV-positive patients die of tuberculosis) and programmes to fight homophobia and stigmatisation.
The report reiterates that every human being has a right of access to health care. It argues that palliative care should be expanded, along with social integration programmes for people infected with the virus, and that sex education should be available to all citizens. The committee urges the Member States to ensure universal access to education and the provision of instruction in the preconditions for personal growth, including an ability to live together in society and ethical principles, the provision of life-skills and sex education, including responsibility and respect for one's partner and action to promote increased safety in schools for all children, to increase protection against violence, abuse, rape, the dangers of sexual promiscuity, unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections including HIV, in the closest possible association with schools, other educational resources, the social services and services that combat juvenile delinquency.
The report strongly encourages the Commission and the Member States to subsidise and provide money for research and development of microbicides and female condoms which give women the power to protect themselves and a male partner from HIV/AIDS with or without the partner's agreement, since condoms continue to be the most well known and widely available protection against HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but require a male partner's agreement.
More funding for research
AIDS research gets too little funding, say MEPs in the committee, who want to see more development work done on microbicides and female condoms. They object to the high cost of new medicinal products, and say that small changes to them should not lead to a proportional prolongation of licences.
The committee also advocates better access for NGOs to Community funding and better co-operation with civil society through a future European forum and national forums.
To help Europe's neighbouring countries, MEPs in the committee urge the use of all political and financial instruments available under the European Neighbourhood Policy, the Nordic Dimension and the TACIS programme (aid for the ex-USSR states) as well as the creation of public-private partnerships.

Safer rules for innovative therapies
2007-04-18 - 17:46
Parliament will be asked to debate and vote on a draft regulation designed to foster gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineering. MEPs in the Environment and Health Committee support the draft text but are calling for guarantees regarding the products and techniques used, plus extra support for smaller companies working in this field. The vote will take place on Wedneday. The unresolved issue of "ethical amendments" poses a threat to any agreement with the Council, which, like the Commission, wants to restrict the new regulation to technical issues, leaving it to Member States to decide on any ethical conditions to be observed on their territory, under the subsidiarity principle.
New technologies - new hope for sufferers
Scientific progress in biology, biotechnology and medicine has stimulated the development of gene and cell-based technologies to prevent or treat ailments of the human body. A number of gene therapy or somatic cell therapy products for treating hereditary diseases, cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's disease and other degenerative conditions are currently undergoing clinical tests.
Another new field in biotechnology is also emerging: tissue engineering, which combines various aspects of medicine, cellular and molecular biology, materials science and engineering, to regenerate, repair or replace human tissue. This new "regenerative medicine" can be applied to skin, cartilage and bone ailments.
Why a new regulation?
These new techniques (gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineering) constitute a coherent whole in that they share a number of scientific, regulatory and economic characteristics.
However, the legislative framework governing them is incomplete. For example, genetic or somatic cell therapy products are classified as medicines and regulated as such in the Community, while for tissue engineering products there are no Community rules at all. The result is differing national approaches to legal classification and authorisation, creating an obstacle to the free movement of tissue engineering products around the EU and thus to patients' access to these therapies.
The new regulation would thus fill a void and also bring all innovative therapies into a single legislative framework. It would set up a centralised marketing authorisation procedure so as to improve the internal market in this sector while ensuring high health protection standards. This will help the competitiveness of EU industries by allowing them to apply for a single authorisation rather than 27.
The regulation does not interfere in decisions made by Member States on whether to allow the use of specific type of cells, such as embryonic stem cells.
The Committee on the Environment and Public Health adopted at the end of January by a large majority a report by Miroslav Mikolášik (EPP-ED, SK) which approves the Commission's draft regulation with a number of amendments.
Controversial issues
Last September an initial version of Mr Mikolášik's report was rejected because of a dispute between members of the Environment Committee on a number of amendments calling for ethical guarantees to be added to the Commission's proposal.
The committee rejected amendments calling for the regulation to ban the commercialisation of the human body, of products modifying the human germ line and of medicines derived from human-animal hybrids or chimeras (created by introducing cells from another species into the embryo).
However, under the European Parliament's rules on "enhanced cooperation" between committees, the Environment Committee has accepted two amendments by the Legal Affairs Committee. One calls for the regulation to exclude medicinal products that contain or are derived from human embryonic or foetal cells or primordial germ cells. The other states that the regulation "should apply only to products made of cells, for which marketing is feasible in the near future and which do not raise major controversies".
Discussions have taken place between the rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs of the other political groups and the Council and Commission to see if a compromise can be reached on these and other issues ahead of the plenary vote. A compromise was within reach on technical aspects but not on the ethical principles which the Council and Commission wanted to exclude from the scope of the regulation. Finally the EP negotiators decided to refer the matter to the plenary. It will thus be up to the full Parliament to decide whether to keep these ethical amendments or not.
Combined medicines produced by hospitals
In the case of a "combined advanced therapy medicinal product" (one which contains a medical device plus bio-material), such as heart pumps, artificial joints or artificial kidneys, the entire product should, says the committee, be the subject of a final evaluation by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). The agency could take account of other evaluations made by other bodies identified in conjunction with the applicant, in accordance with other directives.
The committee also voted to exclude from the regulation advanced therapy medicinal products prepared in full in a hospital "on a one-off basis according to a specific, non-standardised and non-patented process".
The committee also wishes to clarify certain definitions, such as those of products of tissue engineering (to exclude non-viable human or animal tissues) and combined medicinal products). The latter, says the committee, should be made of viable cells or tissue, or of components whose action can be considered as primary if they are not viable.
Strengthening risk management and European expertise
The draft report is calling for the efficacy and any adverse reactions of products to be monitored. It wants the Commission to demand a system of risk management if there is any particular reason for concern. The aim should be to "identify, characterise, prevent or minimise risks" related to these products.
The committee also adopted several amendments seeking to strengthen the role, expertise and independence of the future Committee for Advanced Therapies, which will monitor scientific developments in this field and advise EMEA when the latter assesses applications to market new products.
All members of the Committee for Advanced Therapies should, say MEPs, have experience in the field of advanced therapies and at least two or more should have "scientific expertise" in medical devices. In addition, members and alternate members of the committee must "have no financial or other interests in the biotechnology sector and medical device sector" and any other indirect interests related to these sectors must be entered in a register.
More incentives for smaller companies
To boost the development of innovative therapies, the Commission has proposed reducing by 90% the fee payable to EMEA. Members of the Environment Committee, however, believe that this reduction of 90% should be granted only to smaller companies (SMEs) and that other firms should get a maximum reduction of 65%. They also want incentives for SMEs, a reduction of 50% in the marketing authorisation fee they pay and technical support for such firms.
Transition period
Lastly, the Environment Committee believes that the two-year transition period proposed by the Commission for existing products to comply with regulation is too short. They suggest instead that products other than tissue engineered products should have a four-year transition period.

Floods: risk plans must be more detailed, say MEPs
2007-04-18 - 17:46
In 2005 catastrophic floods caused 40 deaths in Europe, mainly in Romania but also in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. In 2002 around 250 Europeans lost their lives in similar calamities. These disasters are happening more often and seem likely to become more serious. Parliament's Environment Committee is therefore keen for EU Member States to take firmer preventive measures. In early 2006 the European Commission put forward a draft directive on the assessment and management of flood risks, the aim being to induce Member States to coordinate better, for the purposes of risk assessment and for drawing up maps and coordinated management plans. After all, rivers know no frontiers: the Danube basin stretches through 18 European countries, including 10 EU Member States.
At Parliament's first reading vote on 13 June 2006, MEPs called for the threats to human health and the environmental impact of floods to be reflected better in risk management plans. For example, polluting factories should not be built in areas liable to flooding and flood plains should be protected or even restored.
The Council's common position acknowledges the need for Member States to coordinate their efforts on flood plains better but leaves out many of Parliament's amendments. At its second reading vote, the Environment Committee decided that the Council had not committed itself to taking sufficient action. In a report by Richard SEEBER (EPP-ED, AT), MEPs in the committee want to reinstate many of Parliament's first-reading amendments.
Taking account of climate change
The Environment Committee says that even preliminary flood risk assessments must take account of foreseeable climate change. It is known that climate change will lead to increased rainfall in the north and north-east and hence to more flooding, especially in central areas of the EU. The European Environment Agency says that by 2070 the water volume carried by the rivers of north and north-eastern Europe will have grown by 50% or more!
Forecasts indicate that rainfall will not only be more intense but also more frequent. MEPs in the committee therefore says assessments should take account of future, not just current, risks and for such assessments to look also at the effectiveness of existing arrangements for flood prevention.
The committee also wants maps of flood-prone areas and related risks to cover coastal areas and to show any risks of environmental pollution, for example any industries that might cause problems. The maps should also seek to protect wild fauna and flora.
Prevention is best
However, climate change is not the only cause of the growing number of disasters. Human activities, especially the use of land (e.g. construction, deforestation, farming), also play a part. MEPs in the committee are therefore calling for maps and risk management plans to cover flood plains. The state of flood plains, especially the amount of water they retain, has an impact on the downstream environment.
MEPs in the committee also want all policies which can have an impact in this area (agriculture, transport, industry) to take account of flood risks. And they demanded a review of any subsidies to activities which increase risks.
Several other proposed amendments seek to strengthen the principle of solidarity between Member States, for example stating that management plans must take account of measures taken upstream and downstream. MEPs in the committee also flesh out the detail of these plans so that they protect wetlands more and prevent the construction of new buildings in flood zones.
Lastly, a number of amendments are proposed seeking to bring the new text into line with the framework directive on water and with the new comitology rules, which ensure that the EP is fully involved in any technical changes made later to the legislation by committees of experts.

Sustainable use of natural resources
2007-04-18 - 17:46
Kartika Tamara LIOTARD (GUE/NGL, NL) for the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on the sustainable use of natural resources. The committee considers that the Commission's action platform for the study of the sustainable development strategy is too cautious and limited in scope and that, in its present form, it will not be able to persuade the public or political decision-makers to pursue the crucial goals for which it provides. The report calls on the Commission to establish goals and targets at political and at sectoral level for resource efficiency, and speed up the work on appropriate tools to maintain progress.
Targets
The Environment Committee considers that the Commission should take Parliament, European public opinion and the environment seriously, and calls on the Commission to set binding targets and timetables for natural resources in the following way:
(a) to develop and implement best practices for every production chain,
(b) to achieve a quantitative greenhouse gas reduction of at least 30% by 2020 and of 80% by 2050 against 1990 levels.
The committee considers that by 2030 the use of primary non-renewable resources in the EU must be reduced by a factor of 4, or the use of natural resources must be halved by 2030 while simultaneously increasing worldwide prosperity.
The committee stresses that the EU should adopt a clear target for the absolute reduction of resource use, given that the analysis in the Annex to the Commission’s Resources Strategy Communication indicates that we need to go beyond a 3% annual resource efficiency improvement, and that halving resource use in the period 2005-2030 requires almost 6% annual resource efficiency improvement.
The committee proposes that the Commission perform within three years an assessment regarding the possibilities and the instruments for decoupling natural resource use from economic growth. The revised strategy should include these decoupling instruments. This approach should also be implemented in the revision of existing policies.
Sustainable development outside the EU
The report calls on the EU to ensure that all Community instruments and legislation contribute overall to the conservation of natural resources and the pursuit of sustainable development in the EU and countries outside the EU. The committee says that the EU should encourage the establishment of resource strategies in non-EU countries, which should also be reflected in its funds and aid policy.
Subsidies
The report also considers that a reallocation of subsidies, for example more subsidies for small-scale hydroelectric power, as well as for wind power and solar energy, would promote the use of new technologies and improve Europe's competitive position in the world, as well as reducing dependence on fossil fuels imported from other parts of the world.
Keep the consumer informed
Finally, among other points, MEPs in the Environment Committee consider that the EU should do everything possible to provide consumers and producers with proper information on the sustainable use of natural resources, that environmental education, particularly concerning sustainable consumption, should form part of elementary education, and that consumers and producers should be involved in ideas concerning changes which could lead to sustainable use of natural resources.

Intellectual property: pirates and counterfeiters to feel the full weight of criminal law
2007-04-18 - 17:46
Parliament will be asked to approve the first EU directive aiming at harmonising national criminal law when a first-reading report on legislation imposing criminal sanctions for the infringement of intellectual property rights comes up for a plenary vote. The vote will take place on Wednesday. The report is being tabled by the Legal Affairs Committee, whose rapporteur, Nicola ZINGARETTI (PES, IT) says "We are turning a new page: this is the first directive where criminal law is included. […] To harmonise criminal codes will be a radical new thing". If approved by Parliament and the Council, the proposed directive would oblige all Member States to regard as a criminal offence any intentional infringement of an intellectual property right carried out on a commercial scale. The deterrent measures proposed range from fines to imprisonment, depending on the gravity of the crime.
Commercial operators, not private users, targeted
Members of the Legal Affairs Committee backed the overall aim of the Commission proposal, while amending some of its provisions. They excluded patent rights from the scope of the Directive, and decided that criminal sanctions should only apply to those infringements deliberately carried out for commercial advantage. Piracy committed by private users for personal, non-profit purposes are therefore also excluded.
The report aims to ensure that national judicial authorities will always be able to impose sufficiently serious penalties by setting out minimum levels for the upper limits on punishments imposed by national law.
At present maximum fines for violating intellectual property rights range from £586 in Greece to £67,000 in Holland. Maximum prison sentences range from three months in Greece to 10 years in Britain.
Under the new directive, in cases of serious crimes committed by a criminal organisation, the maximum penalty must be at least €300,000 and/or four years' imprisonment. The same applies where the offences carry a health or safety risk. For less serious infringements, the maximum penalties should include criminal and civil fines of at least €100,000. In some cases, remedies can include the seizure and destruction of counterfeited goods.
A series of provisions on investigations was also approved. Member States are asked to ensure that the possibility of initiating investigations is not dependent on a formal accusation, at least when acts were committed in the territory of the Member State. Moreover, EU countries, if the directive is adopted, would have to allow holders of violated intellectual property rights to assist investigations undertaken by joint investigation teams.
Crime pays - for the moment
Counterfeiting is estimated by industry sources to reduce EU GDP by 8 billion euros annually, with individual companies losing a total of between 45 and 65 billion euros. Annual losses in revenue are estimated at 7.2 % for perfume and toiletries, 5.8 % for pharmaceuticals and 11.5 % for the toy and sports sector. 40% of software in use worldwide is believed to be pirated, and 37% in the EU (equalling a loss of revenue of 2.9 billion euros annually). Worldwide, 36% of all music CDs and cassettes sold are pirated (total sales of pirated goods is 5 billion units).
First use of criminal law to enforce Community legislation
This is the first directive using criminal law (with the exception of crossborder damage to the environment, where the right to impose criminal sanctions is laid down in the treaties).
The proposed directive reflects the Commission's interpretation of the European Court of Justice's ruling of 13 September 2005. According to the Commission, this judgment allows for measures under the Community method to required criminal sanctions where these are required for the effective implementation of Community law.

Debate on Galileo - European Satellite Navigation System
2007-04-18 - 17:46
MEPs will debate the Galileo - European Satellite Navigation System after hearing a statement from the Commission. MEPs will also vote on a resolution on the topic. More and more often, it will become necessary to ascertain one's precise position in space and time in a reliable manner. This will be possible with the GALILEO satellite radio navigation system, an initiative launched by the European Union and the European Space Agency. This worldwide system will ensure complementarity with the current GPS system.
The Council conclusions of 22 March read :
In relation to the status of the concession contract negotiations with the bidding consortium for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and its impact on the development of the Galileo project, the Council adopted the following conclusions:
"THE COUNCIL :
notes with concern the report from the President of the Council and the letter from Vice President Barrot of the European Commission concerning the status of the concession negotiations;
recalls the conclusion of the Nice European Council to implement Galileo as a public-private partnership;
urges the bidding consortium, by 10 May 2007, to ensure the conditions for the resumption of negotiations with the GNSS Supervisory Authority (GSA) by implementing its commitments and especially the agreement of 5 December 2005, and to continue these negotiations without delay;
expects substantial progress to be achieved in the negotiations, so that by June 2007 the Council has adequate assurance that the concession negotiations are going ahead successfully, in particular on the basis of a credible roadmap to come to contractual conclusions as soon as possible;
invites the European Commission to assess and report by the June Council on overall progress of the Galileo project, including the outstanding issues listed by the bidding consortium as summarised in the Presidency's report and including the project cost and financing thereof, with a view to the swift progress of the project;
invites the European Commission to submit as soon as possible for discussion possible solutions for securing the long-term public financial obligations, as requested in the Council conclusions of October 2006, including a scenario for the earliest possible provision of EGNOS satellite navigation services as precursor to Galileo, and to report to the June Council;
requests the European Commission, assisted by GSA and ESA, to assess progress in the concession negotiations and to submit alternative scenarios, also assessed for costs, risk and affordability, for the forthcoming June Council meeting."
Third country participation in the European GNSS Supervisory Authority
The Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission to negotiate with non-EU countries with a view to concluding agreements on their associated membership for participation in the European GNSS Supervisory Authority (GSA).
The main objective of this decision is to provide for a harmonised approach concerning all non-EU countries by clearly defining the modalities of their participation within the GSA.
On 8 December 2006, the Commission submitted to the Council a recommendation for negotiations with non-EU countries on their associated membership within the GSA. The possibility of participation by third countries in the GSA is provided for in Regulation No 1321/2001 establishing the GSA and in various cooperation agreements on Galileo signed with non-EU countries.

Parliament set to approve European aviation area
2007-04-18 - 17:46
A multilateral agreement between the EU and non-EU countries on plans to set up a European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) will be the subject of a joint debate based on a Commission statement and a report by Eva Lichtenberger (Greens/EFA, AT). The ECAA is designed to open up aviation markets between the EU and its neighbours. It will establish common rules on freedom of establishment, aviation security, air traffic management, competition and state aid by gradually extending EU aviation legislation to all the signatory countries. The new agreement will replace existing bilateral air service agreements. Various protocols have been added to accommodate the specific needs of each country.
Initial negotiations from 1996 onwards focused on the (then) ten applicant countries. Now the focus has shifted towards the Balkan region. The text of the multilateral agreement has been accepted by the European Community (including Romania and Bulgaria), Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Montenegro, and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.
Parliament is being consulted on this legislation and rapporteur Eva Lichtenberger is calling for MEPs to give it their full backing.

New measures to enhance security in civil aviation
2007-04-18 - 17:46
The Transport Committee is proposing a report on a new regulation laying down common rules regarding checks, searches, surveillance, prohibited items, security patrols and other aspects of airport and aircraft security. MEPs in the committee insist on strict regulation of the use of ‘Sky Marshals’ and the carriage of weapons on board aircraft. Regarding implementing measures, such as the decision by the Commission to ban liquids on board, Members want those to expire after six months.
The second reading report, drawn up by Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT), the Committee proposes to heavily amend the Council's Common Position. "The necessity of new security measures that are implemented quickly and effectively is undoubted. Parliament has done its job and has presented a very balanced text", Mr Costa said.
With regard to implementing measures, such as the decision by the Commission to allow only a certain amount of liquids on board, MEPs in the committee want those to expire after six months. They may, however, be maintained, "but only after a thorough re-evaluation of the security risks and a thorough evaluation of costs and operational impact associated with those measures".
For the first time, European rules will cover security measures during flights, including in-flight security officers. ‘Sky marshals’, as they are commonly known, will have to be properly trained and MEPs in the committee insist that weapons “shall not be carried on board an aircraft, unless the required security conditions have been fulfilled, and authorisation has been given by the State granting the operating licence to the air carrier concerned” . They demand prior approval by the State of departure, by the State of arrival and, where applicable, by “any State which is over flown or where intermediate stops are made”
MEPs in the committee also propose that the costs of the security measures should be met by airline users and Member States, though if a Member State wants to impose even more stringent measures, it will have to cover the whole cost. "This is a reasonable approach, taking into account the protection of airline customers', the industry's and the Member States' interests", Mr Costa said. The report also stresses that security taxes and charges must be used “exclusively to meet airport or on board aircraft security costs”.

Safety at sea: Parliament votes on latest maritime legislation
2007-04-18 - 17:46
The Transport Committee is backing measures put forward by the European Commission to protect Europe against maritime accidents and pollution. This "third maritime safety package" seeks to promote healthy competition between shipping operators who comply with international rules on safety and compensation. Maritime safety has long been a priority of the Parliament. In the wake of the Erika and Prestige oil-spill accidents, the EU passed new legislation on maritime safety but further measures are needed to prevent accidents and pollution and to deal with the aftermath of accidents. The third package covers the obligations of flag states, inspections in EU ports, places for refuge of ships in distress, passenger protection, insurance, classification societies and civil liability.
The EP Transport Committee supports the third package but has substantially amended it. The package consists of seven reports, two of which have already been adopted at the March plenary session in Brussels. The other five reports will be put to the vote at the April plenary session in Strasbourg.
The five draft reports on the agenda of the April plenary session are described here. The two reports adopted in March are described further down.
1) Port state control
This draft directive seeks to improve the standard of safety inspections of ships in European ports by recasting and simplifying existing EU law.
In a report by Dominique VLASTO (EPP-ED, FR) the Transport Committee voted to tighten up the inspection regime, the criteria for selecting ships for inspection and the parameters for calculating a ship's risk profile. A database showing the risk of profiles of ships and indicating all ships due for inspection should be devised by the European Commission, say MEPs.
The Transport Committee also proposes that an expanded inspection regime should apply to vessels with a high risk profile and to passenger ships and oil and chemical tankers more than 12 years old. Pilots should have a bigger role in detecting any shortcomings on board. If port authorities learn that a ship has anomalies or apparent defects, they should inform the competent authority of the port state concerned.
2) Community vessels traffic monitoring and information system
Establishing a clear and precise legal framework on places of refuge for ships in distress is the main aim of this Commission proposal. On behalf of the Transport Committee, rapporteur Dirk Sterckx (ALDE, BE) says that there should be "no margin of discretion" for Member States in applying this decision on places of refuge and that an independent authority should be set up to designate ports of refuge for vessels in distress. The Commission proposed that fishing vessels over 15 metres long should be equipped with the Automatic Identification System but the Transport Committee believes this should be required only of ships over 24 metres long.
3) Investigation of accidents
The inability of some flag States to carry out technical investigations immediately after maritime disasters and incidents is a major concern in shipping circles. This directive would lay down guidelines for such investigations.
The goal of these investigations is not to determine civil or criminal liability but to establish the circumstances and to research the causes of maritime accidents in order to learn lessons and improve maritime safety.
According to rapporteur Jaromir KOHLICEK (GUE/NGL, CZ), the independence of permanent investigation bodies is a key point. The Transport Committee therefore adopted amendments to boost their independence and distinguish more clearly between technical and criminal investigations. It also highlighted the importance of an efficient early warning system and cooperation between Member States.
4) Liability of passenger ships in the event of accidents
This draft directive seeks to provide an EU-wide level playing field for civil liability of shipowners regarding damage caused to passengers and their belongings (e.g. luggage and vehicles).
The Transport Committee, in a report by Paolo Costa (ALDE, IT), backs the draft directive, which would incorporate into EU law the 2002 Protocol to the Athens Convention, thereby introducing compulsory insurance to cover passengers in the event of shipping accidents and raising the compensation limits. It also includes a right for an advance payment in the event of death or injury of a passenger.
5) Ship inspection and survey organisations
This proposal aims to improve the quality of work of the "classification societies" (now known as "recognised organisations"), the private bodies which can be authorised by EU Member States to carry out inspection, checking and certification tasks relating to ships flying their flag.
Rapporteur Luis de GRANDES PASCUAL (EPP-ED, ES) and the Transport Committee back the Commission's plans, which include the creation of an independent assessment committee to certify the quality system of the recognised organisations.
The two reports adopted by Parliament at its plenary session in March are described below.
6) Flag state obligations
The first of the two reports adopted in March, on flag state obligations is one of the key elements in the package. The Commission is proposing that the various International Maritime Organisation conventions should be turned into binding legislation and that the EU Member States must be required to monitor compliance with international standards by ships that fly their flags.
The Council of Transport Ministers strongly opposes this directive, believing that the Community is not entitled to take action in this field and arguing that these matters should be left to international law. Parliament, however, in a report drafted by Martha Vincenzi (PES, IT), urged broad support for the Commission proposal and even adopted amendments making the draft legislation tougher.
7) Civil liability
The second of the two reports adopted in March is on civil liability of shipowners. At present, for much damage caused to third parties, civil liability regimes for EU shipowners vary considerably and insurance schemes are not compulsory. The directive seeks to put in place "core" rules, common to all Member States, governing civil liability, insurance for ship-owners and the liability of any person responsible for operating a ship. It would do this by incorporating the IMO convention on the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC) into EU law.
In a report drafted by Gilles SAVARY (PES, FR), Parliament stresses the need to ensure that only safe ships sail and that any accident victims receive speedy and adequate compensation. It also adds a definition of gross negligence. Parliament voted for Member States to be responsible for enforcing the rules in the directive, for a fund to be set up to compensate victims of damage caused by ships sailing in EU waters without a financial guarantee certificate, and for the creation of a Community Office to keep a register of certificates issued and to check on financial guarantees issued by third countries.
Previous EU maritime safety legislation
Under the previous two maritime safety packages (known as Erika I and Erika II), the European Union adopted a range of legislation on maritime security and safety, including inspections of ships in port and a ban on using single-hull vessels to transport oil, as well as the creation of the European Maritime Safety Agency EMSA.
What next?
The House is expected to adopt the five maritime safety reports on Wednesday 25 April in Strasbourg, under the first reading of the co-decision procedure. Under this procedure, the Council of Transport Ministers will consider the amendments adopted by the EP and respond with a "common position". This common position introduces the second reading.
At the last meeting of the Transport Committee, Achim Grossmann, German Parliamentary State Secretary for Transport, told Committee Members that he envisaged significant progress on the delicate Port State control and vessel traffic monitoring dossiers. He hoped the EP votes in March and April would enable a decisive step to be taken during the German Presidency. But MEPs in reply stressed the need to finalise this co-decision process as soon as possible. They urged Council not to cherrypick, thus ignoring important parts of this package.

Regional policy
Regional Development Committee backs EU enlargement and cohesion report
2007-04-18 - 17:46
Further accessions to the EU could expand its area by 35% and its population by 27%. But they would raise its GDP by only 4% overall, and would actually reduce per capita GDP by 18%. On current criteria, this change would require an extra structural fund budget of €150bn for 2007-2013 (on top of the €308bn approved for 2007-2013). So says an own-initiative report being put forward by Markus PIEPER (EPP-ED, DE) for the Regional Development Committee which looks at ways to rationalise regional spending. The report assesses the likely consequences of the EU accession of Turkey, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Western Balkan states (Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, including Kosovo).
Cost of integration and cohesion
The report takes the EU's "integration capacity" to mean that "it must be in a position, in the light of budgetary realities, to pursue the objective of social, economic and territorial cohesion". Of the extra €150 billion in structural funding, Turkey alone would account for 63%, Croatia for 7% and the other Western Balkan states currently receiving pre-accession assistance for a total of 9.2%.
EU regional policy will come under intense scrutiny, not least for efficiency of spending, in the review of the EU budget scheduled for 2008-2009. The report says that institutional, financial and political reform is necessary in the context of this review, and that the effects of the key regional policy funding instruments (European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund, Cohesion Fund, and European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) on the development of the EU-27 Member States should be compared, with a view to taking appropriate budgetary decisions.
The report therefore calls on the Commission, with a view to forthcoming enlargements, to calculate, separately for each country and at regular intervals, the regional policy expenditure that the EU is likely to incur using the current, as well as amended and extended criteria, and what consequences this would have on regions' existing eligibility for funding. It also recommends drawing on the experience of previous EU enlargements to develop scenarios for funding future European cohesion policy.
Graduated regional policy model
A key concern is that future enlargements could lead to ever more regions losing their eligibility for structural funding, due solely to the "statistical effect", rather than to real-world economic improvements. (This effect occurs when the arrival of relatively poor new Member States reduces EU average per capita GDP, thus making regions in existing ones appear "wealthier" on this measure. However, the effect very much depends on the candidate country - if Croatia joined the EU today, this would have little or no statistical effect on cohesion policy, but if Turkey did, the effect would be substantial).
The report urges the Commission to propose a graduated model for cohesion policy, making it possible to draw a further distinction between pre-accession assistance and membership, and enabling potential accession candidates to receive effective support for regional development, subject to their political progress, prior to possible EU membership.
Making regional spending go further
The report recommends various ways to make regional policy spending more effective, including:
• boosting Member States' individual responsibility by introducing higher rates of co-financing , particularly in regions already in receipt of EU funding for many years,
• making greater use of the leverage effect of loan financing (particularly in regions already long in receipt of EU funding),
• gearing structural funding to avoid displacement effects and EU funding of companies' relocation ,
• linking the award of cohesion policy funds to a favourable sustainable national growth policy , to be defined by measurable quantitative and qualitative indicators covering more than just per capita GDP,
• concentrating regional competitiveness and territorial co-operation funding on the "Europeanisation " of the regional economy and on infrastructure of European importance, and
• stepping up use of the European Social Fund to help regions cope with the social challenges of globalisation and the effects of demographic change. Rapporteur Markus PIEPER EPP-ED DE A6-0087/2007 Consequences of future enlargements on the effectiveness of cohesion policy Procedure : Consultation

Budget
Commission's annual policy strategy for the 2008 budget procedure
2007-04-18 - 17:46
Kyösti VIRRANKOSKI (ALDE, FI) for the Budgets Committee will be tabling a report on the Commission's annual policy strategy for the 2008 budget procedure. The report notes that 2007 will see the start of preparatory work on the 2008-2009 full, wide-ranging review (mid-term review) of the 2007-2013 multi-annual financial framework (MFF). A budget for results - transparent presentation, clear objectives, accurate implementation
The committee underlines once again the importance that it attaches to EU spending programmes effectively delivering on the political objectives which they were legislated to achieve. The report affirms its intention, therefore, to give to its work on the 2008 budget the philosophy of a 'budget for results'. The committee underlines the importance of monitoring budget implementation as a tool for examining the delivery of policy.
Human resources - appropriate allocation, personal responsibility, monitored outsourcing
The Budgets Committee is strongly of the view that an effective and cost-efficient administrative system for the European Union must be equipped with the necessary level of resources; awaits with interest the results of the screening exercise being carried out by the Commission services on the Commission's real staff needs that is due to be presented on 30 April 2007. The committee welcomes the further indications in the 2008 APS of the Commission's efforts to re-direct its human resources towards political priorities but rejects the presentation of these priorities according to the labels prosperity, solidarity, security and external projection.
MEPs in the committee express their concern that the expansion of existing decentralised agencies will reduce the margins available under the headings of the MFF.
Specific points - Energy / CAP reforms / Information campaigns
Among the specific points raised by the Budgets Committee, MEPs highlight that energy efficiency is a highly future-oriented priority for tackling the problem of climate change. The committee agrees that such a policy requests a cross-cutting strategy and asks the Commission to continue to take decisive actions towards this aim. The committee welcomes the Commission's intention to undertake key actions in the field of research and innovation to bring forward the implementation of the Lisbon strategy in 2008. The report supports, in particular, the preparatory work in order to ensure that a decision to set up a European Institute of Technology (EIT) is adopted in the course of 2007.
The committee expects precise proposals from the Commission as regards the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy.
The report considers that the core business of communication and information policy is to inform the EU citizens on the actions and programmes realised by the EU and the improvements generated over the last years. The committee is of the opinion that the campaign on political priorities should be defined at a later stage of the budgetary procedure taking into account Parliament's priorities.

Budgetary control
2005 discharge - Member States' responsibility in question
2007-04-18 - 17:46
MEPs on the Budgetary Control committee have relaunched the idea of "national declarations." They are demanding that EU Member States take responsibility for co-managing Community funds, alongside the European Commission. Another idea from the 2005 discharge exercise is to look at the cost/benefit ratio of Community spending audits, which MEPs would like to see rationalised. The concept of "national declarations" first arose in the 2003 discharge. These declarations were intended to provide an assurance from Member States that effective auditing systems for Community spending exist on their territory. MEPs stress that these declarations should be signed by someone with "due authority" at national level.
Although EU Treaty Article 274 stipulates that the European Commission is responsible for managing the budget, Community spending co-managed with Member States accounts for almost 80% of the budget. Things are evolving, as the Netherlands has agreed in principle to a national declaration (and other Member States, such as the UK and Sweden, are thinking of doing likewise), even though the plan initially made no headway in the Council.
A step towards a statement of assurance
These national declarations, according to the 2005 Commission discharge report by Salvador GARRIGA POLLEDO (EPP-ED, ES) may be multiple, so as to reflect the realities of the Member States' differing political systems. They would also help to "improve the quality of national supervisory and control systems", and hence the management of the Community budget. The report also observes that the declarations could facilitate a positive 'statement of assurance' (DAS)" being obtained from the Court of Auditors.
The Commission is therefore invited to submit to the Council a proposal for a national management declaration covering all Community funds under shared management, based on sub-declarations by the various national bodies responsible for the management of expenditure, with, if possible, the participation of national audit bodies.
National statements could clearly make a very useful contribution to the Community's auditing arrangements: in very large areas of Community budget management (CAP spending that is not subject to the IACS integrated administration and control system, structural funds, internal policies, external actions, SAPARD programme), the Court of Auditors has found that the effectiveness of supervisory and control systems should be improved.
These deficiencies make it impossible to obtain a positive statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts, notes the report.
Seek out errors, but not at any price
MEPs in the committee want the issue of the "acceptable rate of error" clarified, after the cost of controls has been assessed. The committee believes it crucial to take account of the cost benefit ratio between the resources dedicated to control activities and the results obtained by the controls.
The report notes, moreover, with great concern, the large number of errors picked up by the Court of Auditors in operations at the level of the final beneficiary.
The text approved in committee calls on the Commission to further improve its effective supervision of controls delegated to Member States. Should Member States' control systems still prove insufficient, the Commission should impose clear deadlines and apply sanctions where those deadlines are not met.
Reimburse!
The effective recovery rate can also be improved, says the draft report, but only via the Member States' enforcement agencies. It could be helped by revealing the identities of debtors who have been found guilty by the courts but are unwilling to make payment. Improved recovery would also boost the European institutions' credibility.
Likewise, the Commission should simplify the rules and apply existing legislation on suspension of payments where necessary and act when Member States fail to comply with basic requirements.
This idea of publication also appears in the area of transparency. Whereas the report welcomes the Commission's transparency initiative, it also calls on the Commission to do everything in its power to persuade Member States to grant the public a right of access to information - via a web site - on projects and the beneficiaries of various Community shared-management funds.
Lastly, the Commission is invited to publish information on the expert groups upon which it calls in its work, including the names and fields of expertise of the groups' members.
The Committee voted in favour of a proposal to grant a discharge to the Commission for 2005.
Discharge for the agencies
As regards the grant of a discharge to the sixteen executive agencies (rapporteur: Edit HERCZOG (PES, HU), the Budgetary Control Committee recommends a series of cross-cutting observations in the resolutions accompanying its decisions, which are positive.
MEPs in the committee consider that the "ever growing number" of Community agencies and their activities do not seem to fit into an overall framework. Their role, in some cases, does not meet citizens' expectations. The European Commission is therefore invited to set out general guidelines for the creation of new agencies, whilst avoiding any duplication of activity between the agencies and the institutions.
Other institutions
The Budgetary Control Committee recommends granting discharges to all the other institutions, including Parliament. Rapporteur Salvador GARRIGA POLLEDO EPP-ED ES Rapporteur Edit HERCZOG PES HU Discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2005

Expert rapid reaction teams may be formed to provide technical and operational help at times of big influxes of illegal migrants over the external borders of any EU Member State if Parliament as a whole endorses a report approved by the Civil Liberties Committee. This report, the fruit of an agreement with Council on a proposed regulation, will be put to a first reading plenary vote in Strasbourg. Given the difficulties that some southern Member States face in coping with massive arrivals of illegal immigrants by sea, in 2005 the Council asked the European Commission to table a proposal to create "Rapid Border Intervention Teams". It stipulated that these teams should pool Member States financial means and human resources to act in emergencies at EU frontiers, but always under the co-ordination of the EU frontier management agency Frontex. A draft regulation would lay down common rules for the tasks that can be carried out by the "guest" border officers of other Member States within Frontex joint operations. In negotiations, questions immediately arose over the funding of the teams and the need for all Member States to contribute financial and human means.
Mandatory solidarity
The principle of "mandatory solidarity", under which all Member States must deploy especially-trained border guards upon Frontex's request was enshrined in the agreement reached with the Council by Parliament's rapporteur Gerard DEPREZ (ALDE, BE). Rapid intervention teams will be mobilised "for a limited period" and only if the country faces an "urgent and exceptional pressure". The decision as to whether an influx amounts to an "emergency" justifying a request to mobilise an intervention team will by taken by the Director of Frontex.
Member State contributions
According to the draft regulation, it will be up to Frontex Management Board to decide by a three-quarters majority the profiles and the overall number of border guards to be made available by each Member State. EU countries will then be required to contribute border guards corresponding to the required profiles, unless they themselves face "an exceptional situation substantially affecting the discharge of national tasks".
The salaries of border guards deployed in rapid border intervention teams deployed in a host country will continue to be paid by the home countries, but the extra costs of operations (travel expenses, repatriation, insurance, living costs), will be borne by Frontex. To this end, Parliament has boosted the agency's budget by €10 million for 2007.
Tasks and powers
Team members may only perform tasks and exercise powers "under the instructions from and, as a general rule, in the presence of border guards of the host Member State", says the draft regulation. A provision inserted by MEPs in the committee in the compromise text stresses that the exercise of these powers needs to be proportionate to the objectives and "shall not discriminate against persons on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation".

More stable financial framework for the Regional Advisory Councils
2007-04-18 - 17:46
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report by Elspeth ATTWOOLL (ALDE, UK) recommending that the EP approve a proposal which aims to put Regional Advisory Councils on a sounder operational basis by improving the conditions under which they are funded. The committee underlines that the current proposal relates only to the financial aspects of RACs and that other aspects remain to be resolved at the time of the forthcoming review, in particular those relating to their number and composition. The Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) were established as a result of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, adopted in 2002. Council Decision 2004/585/EC defines a general framework for the functioning of the RACs to ensure a consistent and balanced approach amongst them. The possibility of granting Community financial aid to RACs is one of the aspects included in this Decision.
The purpose of the Commission proposal amending Decision 2004/585/EC is to put RACs on a sounder operational basis by improving the conditions under which they are funded. This is to be effected by mainstreaming them into the budget, meaning that the Community contribution no longer needs to be a degressive one and that they are subject to a single method of accounting, rather than two separate procedures as at present.
RACs: bodies pursuing an aim of European general interest
Defining RACs as "bodies pursuing an aim of European general interest" would provide them with a stable financial framework enhancing their capacity to operate effectively. Furthermore, experience has shown that the existing RACs have difficulties with the current decreasing financial framework which, according to the Commission, will seriously hinder their ability to meet their objectives in the near future. The new financial modalities will simplify the management of the grants by merging the current two grants into a single grant for each RAC.
Council Decision 2004/585/EC needs to be amended accordingly by declaring RACs as bodies pursuing an aim of European general interest, with the result that RACs would receive a fixed financial contribution from the Community budget.
RACs aim at involving stakeholders at an early stage in the decision-making process of the Common Fisheries Policy. Stakeholders' involvement is an essential pillar of the CFP reform and is key for its successful implementation.
Currently, four of the seven intended RACs are fully operational, with others likely to come on-stream in the near future. Moreover, an Inter-RAC Committee has been established to coordinate their activities. Recommendations and advice have been given to the Commission on more than 80 occasions and the RACs have also made a valuable contribution to the deliberations of the EP’s Fisheries Committee.
The proposal does not affect any other aspect of the RAC's composition and workings, which will form the subject of a review to be published later this year.

Fisheries Committee proposes report on the support scheme for the outermost regions
2007-04-18 - 17:46
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report by Duarte FREITAS (EPP-ED, PT) on a support scheme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French Departments of Guiana and Réunion from 2007 to 2013. MEPs in the committee add €2m to the annual overall budget in order to cover the increase in transport and energy costs and say that products such as olive oil, which is used in fish processing, should also be eligible for support.
The Commission proposal provides for a support scheme for the outermost regions for the next seven years designed to compensate for the additional costs incurred by operators in relation to the marketing of certain fishery products. Support may be granted to fish producers, owners or operators of fishing vessels and operators in the fish processing or marketing sector.
The Fisheries Committee is proposing, under the consultation procedure, some amendments to the proposal:
- Without altering the proportions to be allocated to the individual Member States, MEPs add €2m to the annual overall budget in order to cover the increase in transport and energy costs since 2003. The overall budget is thus raised from about €15m to €17m. The total amount of compensation per year should not exceed:
Azores and Madeira
€4,855,314
Canary Islands
€6,623,454
French Guiana and Réunion
€5,518,000
- The support granted under this scheme should have a wider spectrum and not be targeted solely at the transport costs incurred in marketing fishery products. There are other additional supply and logistics costs associated with the processing of fish which should be duly taken into account.
- The additional costs linked to the use of raw materials such as olive and other oils, salt etc. should also be eligible for support.
- Compensation should not be restricted to 75% of the transport costs. It should be sufficient to fully offset the additional costs arising from remoteness and it should cover the cost of transport "to the European continent" and also "between regions".
- It should continue to be permissible – when catches by local fleets are insufficient – for local processing industries to be supplied by Community vessels, since this enables economic activity and employment to be maintained in the outermost regions.
- A modulation may be made among regions belonging to a Member State within the limits of the overall financial framework.
- As for the Posei-Agriculture scheme, a derogation should be granted for the outermost regions as regards state aid for the production, processing and marketing of fishery products.
- The Posei-Fisheries scheme (programme of options specifically relating to remoteness and insularity for fisheries) should, like the Posei-Agriculture, be a permanent scheme that is not limited in time, since the geographical and structural constraints that justify its application cannot be altered. To enable the compensation scheme to be revised, the European Commission should submit a report by 31 December 2011, accompanied, if necessary, by appropriate legislative proposals.
According to the rapporteur, the compensation scheme has facilitated the development and consolidation of certain activities. The aquaculture sector in the Canary Islands, for instance, produces chiefly for the mainland market and has benefited significantly from the scheme. The same applies to the tuna canning industry in the Azores, tuna loins and black scabbard fish in Madeira and the shrimp industry in Guiana. As a consequence, employment has been stabilised or even increased.
This compensation scheme, introduced in 1992 and extended in 1994, 1995, 1998 and 2002, was initially granted to the archipelagos of the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, and was extended to the French territories of Guiana in 1994 and Réunion in 1998.

Fisheries
Increase public aid to improve working and hygiene conditions on board vessels
2007-04-18 - 17:46
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report on a proposal to amend the basic regulation on the Common Fisheries Policy as regards the management of fleet capacity. According to the rapporteur, Ioannis GLAVAKIS (EPP-ED, EL), the reallocation of 4% of the tonnage withdrawn with public aid is too low in relation to the whole of the coastal fishing fleet and is not sufficient to improve safety, hygiene, working conditions and product quality on board. The committee proposes a 10% reallocation. The amendment of the basic regulation on the revised Common Fisheries Policy will give the Member States the possibility for a limited increase in the capacity of their fleet for the purpose of improving safety, working conditions, hygiene and product quality on board, as well as energy efficiency.
The Commission proposes to amend the provisions applying to fleet capacity management which are included in Chapter III of Regulation 2371/2002, in particular article 11 on the adjustment of fishing capacity and article 13 on the entry-exit scheme and overall capacity reduction.
As regards the amendment to article 11, the rapporteur takes the view that the possibility of reallocating 4% of the tonnage withdrawn with public aid will not provide any real assistance for the sector concerned, since it represents more than 80% of the fishing fleet. In this light, "4% is a very small percentage" which will have to be shared among a very large number of vessels.
Given that the actual amendment does not increase the vessels’ capacity, a slight increase in the proposed percentage – from 4% to 10% of the total tonnage scrapped with public aid – "could improve working and hygiene conditions on board", says the rapporteur. "Still more importantly, this would improve the competitiveness of the coastal fleet, which has a significant socio-economic impact on the communities concerned", he adds.
Ioannis GLAVAKIS agrees that, when allocating this percentage, priority should be given to small-scale coastal fishing vessels, i.e. vessels with an overall length of less than 12 metres, since this sector has been badly affected by the change in fishing conditions and its viability is uncertain.
Reduction in power of the engines
Concerning the amendment to article 13, the proposal introduces a new provision according to which the reduction in power following the replacement of an engine with public aid may not be restored. This new provision has been added to make the new regulation compatible with the objective of fleet capacity reduction laid down in the European Fisheries Fund.
The possibility of changing the engines of fishing vessels with financial support varies according to the type of vessel: where vessels belong to the small-scale coastal fleet, i.e. if they are no more than 12 metres in length, the new engine must have the same power as the old one, whilst for larger vessels the new engine must have at least 20% less power.
The committee is proposing an amendment stating that "this reduction in power must not in any circumstances diminish the vessel's safety conditions, habitability or the efficiency of fish-processing systems". Furthermore, given that the objective of the reduction is to avoid any increase in the vessel's fishing capacity, the provision "shall not be taken into account where the engine is replaced for reasons of energy saving and/or improving the vessel's performance in areas other than fishing capacity, or where the vessel has opted for more selective fishing methods".

Health and safety at work: rules on reporting to be simplified
2007-04-18 - 17:46
Under the 1989 directive and related directives on measures to improve workers' health and safety, the EU Member States are supposed to report to the Commission on the practical implementation of their health and safety rules. However, some Member States have failed to do this. The EP Employment Committee is tabling to the House a report on proposals to simplify the rules on this matter so that more Member States comply. At present, Member States are required to draw up reports under several individual directives, but the frequency varies: some reports have to be produced every four years, others every five years. The Commission is now proposing that a single report (covering all the directives) be drawn up every five years.
In a report by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL, PT) under the codecision procedure, the Employment Committee approved the Commission's plans with a number of amendments which were the fruit of a compromise with the Council aimed at reaching an agreement at first reading. The plenary is expected to endorse this compromise.
