MEPs support action against cat and dog fur trade
While many cats and dogs will be gratefully received as presents this Christmas, the barbaric trade in their fur continues to prosper. Most of the unfortunate animals come from Asia, mainly China, where their fur is used in small cat and dog figurines. Most people who buy them are unaware that they contain real fur from animals kept in inhumane conditions.
Meeting in October, MEPs overwhelming agreed to support a report from German Christian Democrat Elisabeth Jeggle that calls for stricter animal protection and animal welfare rules. The report supported the European Commission's "Action Plan" on the welfare of animals that calls for a complete ban on the import, export, trade and processing of cat and dog fur.
A separate regulation that proposes these measures will shortly begin its legislative passage through Parliament. If approved, these products could be totally outlawed by 2008.
False labelling hides identity
British Conservative Struan Stevenson has championed opposition to the trade. He explains, "animals are often skinned alive and left dying, writhing and yelping in unimaginable agony. The pelts from these tortured animals have appeared...not only as toy cat figurines but also as full length coats, homeopathic arthritis aids, hair bows for children, trim on sweaters and linings for boots and gloves".
A common way of hiding their true identity is false labelling. Mr Stevenson estimates that 2 million cats and dogs die every year in the trade.
The campaign against this trade has been going on for seven years and to date five EU members have unilaterally banned such goods. By launching action at EU level, campaigners are hoping for a ban in all the 25 EU members.
