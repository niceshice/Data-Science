Addressing human rights violations, clarifying counter-terrorism detention rules, resolving the conflict in Gaza and southern Israel, and opposing Iran's UN Human Rights Council (UN HRC) candidacy are the key issues Parliament wants to see tackled at the 13th UN Human Rights Council session (Geneva, 1-26 March).
Parliament, which approved its priorities by a show of hands on Thursday, will be represented at the meeting from 14 to 16 March by two Human Rights Sub-Committee members: Ms Laima Liucija Andrikienė (EPP, LT), Mr Eduard Kukan (EPP, SK) and Mr Richard Howitt (S&D, UK).
MEPs welcome the fact that the impact of the global financial crisis on human rights situation worldwide is high on the UN HRC agenda, as effective enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, are being challenged due to the crisis.
Addressing serious human rights situations
Parliament regrets that the UNHRC has been unable to address in timely fashion serious human rights situations like those in Afghanistan, Guinea-Conakry, Iran, Yemen and Iraq. It therefore urges to EU Member States are called to condemn these violations and help to create UN HRC response mechanisms.
Report on secret counter-terrorism detentions
MEPs welcome the fact that the UNHRC agenda includes a " Joint study on global practices in relation to secret detention in the context of countering terrorism ". EU Member States are asked to support and act upon this study, in line with the previous European Parliament statements on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners.
Follow-up to the Goldstone report
MEPs reiterate their desire for a strong EU common position on the follow-up to the UN fact-finding mission report on the conflict in Gaza and southern Israel, demanding "the implementation of its recommendations and accountability for all violations of international law including alleged war crimes" and urging both sides to conduct investigations that meet international standards of independence.
"Respect for international human rights law and international humanitarian law by all parties and under any circumstances is an essential precondition for achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East", stress MEPs.
Iran's UN Human Rights Council candidacy
MEPs are concerned at Iran's candidacy for the UNHRC to be held in May 2010 and urge the EU to do its utmost "to prevent the election to the UN HRC of countries with the most problematic human rights records." The EU and its Member States should continue to press for the establishment of membership criteria for election to the UN HRC, they say.
