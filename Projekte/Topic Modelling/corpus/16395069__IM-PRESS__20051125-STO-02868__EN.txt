Cocaine use on the rise
Cocaine use is on the rise in the EU and is of increasing concern, but cannabis remains the most widely-used illegal substance, according to the latest report on drug problems across Europe from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).
An estimated 9 million Europeans (3% of the adult population) have ever used cocaine and between 3 to 3.5 million (1% of adults) are likely to have tried it over the last year, with 1.5 million current users in October, according to the 2005 annual report from the Lisbon-based EU drugs agency, presented to the European Parliament on Wednesday. Use is concentrated in the 15-34 age group, particularly young urban males. There are big differences in cocaine use between different countries with the highest usage in the UK and Spain, where around 4% of young people are users. That is particularly worrying because this could lead to an increase in deaths related to cocaine, drug agency director Wolfgang Götz told the Parliament's civil liberties committee. The report says there may be links between cocaine use and cardiovascular problems. Cannabis is "an increasing source of concern" Over 62 million Europeans have tried cannabis, 20 million in the last year, with 9.5 million "current users," according to the report. Götz told MEPs that "cannabis is an increasing source of concern...3 million young adults take it on a daily or near daily basis," particularly young men. "It's not just a joint at the weekend, it's 10 joints a day." He noted that the proportion is very high in Spain, the UK, France and the Czech Republic, who report levels of 17%-22%. Help for heroin addicts Heroin remains a big problem and "causes the most damage to our society" with around 2 million users, about half of whom inject the drug, he added. However, he noted that this is the area in which the most is being done to help addicts, with a strong growth in "substitution therapy" over the past 10 years. The agency estimates that between 25%-50% of those with opiate problems are receiving treatment and Mr Götz described this as "the real success of the EU drug policy". However, he warned that the problem of hepatitis C is seriously underestimated, with over 60% of injecting drug users infected. The agency monitors drug use in the 25 EU countries, Norway, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. The statistics highlight some troubling differences between the older member states and the newer members and prospective members from Eastern and Central Europe with only 1% of clients in substitution treatment coming from those countries. "A key issue today is the multiple use of different substances, not just illegal...but all sorts of substances, including alcohol and tobacco," Mr Götz said. "We will monitor this in the future." Giusto Catania from the Italian left warned that we should be careful when considering the effects of different drugs. With alcohol, tobacco and caffeine "we are all multi-consumers of drugs." A number of MEPs stressed the importance of the agency in ensuring a good flow of information at EU level. Belgian Christian Democrat Frederika Brepoels said the Agency could act as an early warning system for new synthetic drugs. "It would be very valuable in helping to get integrated EU action."
