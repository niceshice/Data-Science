President BORRELL will be joined by Jean Marie CAVADA (ALDE, FR), Chair of the Civil Liberties Committee and Michael CASHMAN (PES, UK), chair of the cross-party EP intergroup on lesbian and gay rights, for a press conference before the seminar gets underway.
IDAHO is intended as an annual opportunity to evaluate progress and setbacks in the field of anti-discrimination. This day was first marked last year on the 25th anniversary of the WHO removing homosexuality from its list of mental disorders. Its main goal is to articulare action and reflection in order to combat all physical, moral or symbolic violence related to sexual orientation or gender identity. Campaigners hope it will be officially recognised by the EU and UN in the future.
Participants include experts, campaigners and victims of homophobia from across Europe. President Borrell will open the event, with Mr Cavada and Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini making introductory speeches. The seminar will be completed with concluding remarks from Alexander STUBB (EPP-ED, FI). 16:30 18:30 Strasbourg, N 1.3 EP resolution on homophobia in Europe 2006-05-18 Plenary session -
