At the request of Jan ANDERSSON (PES, SE), MEPs voted to send this report back to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee for further consideration.

The consequences can be serious, including infections from HIV or hepatitis B or C. The EP Social Affairs Committee wants to improve existing EU legislation so as to give workers better protection.
