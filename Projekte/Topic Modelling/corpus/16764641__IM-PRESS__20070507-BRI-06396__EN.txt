13 Nobel Prize winners, MEPs support Estonia / support for new government in Northern Ireland
Ahead of the plenary, Parliament held a special event to mark the 50th anniversary of the European Union. A group of European Nobel prize winners were invited to take part in a debate on the past, present and future of the EU, focusing on its scientific, intellectual and cultural achievements.
Estonia-Russia relations and the formation of the new government in Northern Ireland were also debated at the opening of this plenary session in Brussels.
Climate change: composition of EP temporary committee
On 10 May, Parliament adopted the composition of its new temporary committee on climate change. The 60-member strong committee will hold its constituent meeting on 21 May in Strasbourg. The mandate of this committee was approved by the Conference of Presidents (the EP political group leaders) on 19 April and confirmed by a plenary vote on 25 April.
Blind-spot mirrors to be retrofitted to older lorries
Parliament adopted a first-reading report approving with amendments a Commission draft directive calling for blind-spot mirrors to be "retrofitted" to heavy lorries which have been in operation since 2000. The deadline will be 31 March 2009. Each year, 400 Europeans - many of them children on bikes - are killed when lorry drivers changing direction at a crossing or roundabout fail to see them in a blind spot around the vehicle.
Small manufacturers and disabled users to benefit from new road vehicle standards
At a second-reading vote on Vehicle Type Approval, Parliament approved, with amendments, new rules on the manufacturing standards of road vehicles. These will raise environmental and safety standards as well as making it easier for producers to sell their vehicles Europe-wide. Thanks to MEPs, the legislation will take more account of the needs of disabled car users.
More competition in public transport - but with safeguards
Parliament approved with amendments, at a second-reading vote, new rules on public passenger transport services by rail and by road which seek to rebalance the award of contracts for these services between the public and private sectors.
More choice of package sizes for shoppers
Parliament gave qualified backing on 10 May to the Council's common position on a proposal to deregulate pack sizes for pre-packed products. Once the legislation is implemented, it will be possible to sell many everyday consumer products in a wider range of sizes than at present.
EU funding for better housing?
A lack of decent, affordable housing directly affects EU citizens, by restricting their options for social integration and mobility, in both urban and rural areas. But in the new Member States, EU funding is already available to help with housing renovation and redevelopment and this possibility should be considered from 2009 for old Member States, too.
Regional policy recipe for EU innovative capacity
Providing equal access to education at all levels ensuring that thinkers have very cheap (or free) broadband internet access to scientific, economic, legal, cultural and administrative information, enforcing intellectual property rights and fostering cross-border co-operation among regional academic and business stakeholders are key ways in which regional policy makers can help build the EU's innovative capacity.
Human rights must be a core principle of EU-Russia relations say MEPs
Russia remains an important partner for Europe, especially in energy relations, but this relationship must set democratic values and human rights as its core principle, says a resolution adopted by a large majority in the EP. The lifting of Russia's ban on Polish agricultural products is another demand of the House. On Estonia, it calls on Russia to "fully respect its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations," guaranteeing the protection of embassies and diplomats.
Arab world reform: a European perspective
Any outside attempt to impose reforms, without the partner countries having a sufficient stake in the processes and means employed to achieve them, “is bound to fail”. This, for the European Parliament, was the point of departure for an own-initiative report -- drafted by Michel ROCARD (PES, FR) - on “Reforms in the Arab world: what strategy should the European Union adopt?”, endorsed by a wide majority of MEPs.
Horn of Africa : MEPs call for "African solutions"
A report on the war-ravaged Horn of Africa (Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda) was adopted with amendments with MEPs asking for "African solutions" to stabilise the region. They also call for consolidation of the EU presence through the appointment of an EU special representative.
MEPs call for modernisation of European legislation on consultation and information of w orkers
In adopting a joint resolution of the PES, ALDE and Greens/EFA groups on strengthening European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers, MEPs call on the Commission to review and update European legislation concerning consultation and information of workers, in order to ensure a coherent and efficient framework of law, guarantee legal certainty and improve the articulation of social dialogue between the national and the European levels.
MEPs urge Denmark to act over 1968 nuclear air crash
Parliament voted by 544 votes to 29, with 40 abstentions, in favour of a resolution tabled by the Petitions Committee calling on Denmark to take belated action in relation to the alleged health consequences of the 1968 crash in Greenland of a US plane carrying nuclear bombs.

13 Nobel Prize winners, MEPs support Estonia / support for Northern Ireland new government
2007-05-11 - 13:30
Ahead of the plenary, thirteen Europeans who have been honoured with the Nobel Prize were at the European Parliament. They took part in a discussion on the past, present and future of the European Union. Taking place on Europe Day, the objective was to focus on the scientific, intellectual and cultural achievements of Europeans since 1957. Estonia-Russia relations and the recent developments in Northern Ireland were also debated at the opening of the session in Brussels. Statements on relations between Estonia and Russia
European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said "The Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950 gave Europe the foundation on which partnership could develop in peace and freedom between formerly hostile nations. But 9 May is for others a controversial date, as we have seen in the dispute over the Soviet military memorial in Estonia's capital Tallinn."
President Pöttering pointed out that the European Parliament's resolution of 12 May 2005 stated that "for many nations the end of World War II meant a new tyranny from the Soviet Union".
President Pöttering referred to former MEP Toomas-Hendrik Ilves who is now President of Estonia, who said in connection with the events outside the Estonian embassy in Moscow: "It is unusual in Europe to demand the resignation of the democratically elected government of a neighbouring country. It is unthinkable in Europe to disregard the Vienna Convention on the protection of diplomatic representations".
President Pöttering concluded and said: "The European Union is based on values. Protecting these values is our common task. Where a country of the European Union is put under pressure, we must all stand up to be counted. Estonia can rely on our solidarity".
Estonian MEP Tunne KELAM spoke for the EPP-ED group. He said "what is happening is not a bilateral issue" but "a test case for the EU as a whole". It was important to avoid "wishful thinking": President Putin, in his speech in Munich, had made clear that Russia was now seeking to "regain influence over the Baltic states and then those of the former Warsaw Pact", using the energy boom and Russians outside Russia as his tools. Mr Kelam, however, stressed that "99% of the Russians in Estonia are loyal not to Putin but to the Estonian state". Sovereignty was the key point, he emphasised, including "the right to decide and assess our past". In conclusion, he said, "we need your solidarity and I am very thankful to all of you for demonstrating it".
Johannes Hannes SWOBODA (PES, AT) lent his group's "full support to Estonia and the Estonian people", saying "any outside intervention by Russia should be denounced". A key point was that Russians must come to understand that at the end of the war "many Russians did come as liberators but the regime that they brought with them" also came "as occupying forces and forces of oppression". He wished that citizens on all sides of the borders of the former eastern bloc would acknowledge that "double reality".
On behalf of the Liberals, Estonian MEP Siiri OVIIR spoke of the day on 9 March 1944 when 40% of Tallinn was laid waste by Soviet bombers and the later deportation of many Estonians to Siberia. For such reasons, she said, "the war memorial is associated in Estonian minds with painful experiences". She described the more recent events leading up to the tension around the war memorial before concluding by thanking all those who supported her country's stance.
Brian CROWLEY (IE), on behalf of the UEN Group said: "I would like to join my colleagues in firstly giving our solidarity and support to the Estonian Government and to the Estonian people and, secondly, in denouncing the bully-boy tactics of the Russian Government in what they have attempted to create - the uncertainty and instability, not only within Estonia but in all the Baltic States.
In many ways what we are witnessing is a new form of totalitarianism or authoritarianism by utilisation of mobs in Moscow to attack an Embassy, by utilising the power or strength of energy to try and make people kneel to the influence of the Russian Government and, most importantly of all, by a continuing desire to keep imposing symbols of domination and of subjugation in areas that have gained their independence from totalitarian regimes. Finally, may I say, a most ardent call should go out to the citizens of Estonia to show them that now that they are part of the European Union, they will not be abandoned as they were abandoned previously."
Gabriele ZIMMER (DE) speaking for the GUE/NGL group, said that "the domestic events in Tallinn have been taken out of all proportion." What was "a peaceful demonstration in Tallinn", she continued, "turned into a riot", with regrettable behaviour by the police authorities. "We here in the EP have to shoulder some of the responsibility", she continued, and said that the GUE/NGL group "call upon Russia to respect international convections", for "no obstacles should be placed in the way of the EU-Russia summit."
Nils LUNDGREN (IND/DEM, SE) stressed that "we should be turning to the Russian government and should be saying that Russian minorities do have rights", but reminding Russia that "Estonia is an autonomous country that does not fall within the sphere of influence of the Russian state." Russia therefore "has no right to do what it's doing now." Current events, Mr Lundgren continued, have "nothing to do with Hitler and what happened under Hitler." Mr Lundgren concluded by stating that "Estonia is not a Russian country, it's an independent country."
Bruno GOLLNISCH (FR), speaking for the ITS group, said that it was possible to "understand the humiliation of Russian minorities", yet equally important that we "leave Estonia free" to find a way of honouring legitimate sacrifices during conflicts in which people defended the sovereignty of their nation.
MEP support for Northern Ireland's new government
Speaking at the beginning of the plenary session on the formation of the new government Brian Crowley (UEN) said: "Yesterday saw the inauguration or the installation of a new government in Northern Ireland and the resolution of the devolved assembly in Northern Ireland representing what would have previously been called the extreme opinion of Unionism and the extreme opinion of nationalism has been brought together to form new government for Northern Ireland."
This is after what we heard from the Nobel laureates is a great opportunity for us not only to congratulate those people that have been involved and to encourage them in finding a new way forward of solving conflict and new ways to resolve difficulties that occur between different communities but also to congratulate the European Union for its ongoing commitment and help to the people of Northern Ireland over the last 20 years. When we see John Hume here today and Lord Trimble the reasons such greatness took place yesterday was because the people there yesterday were standing on the shoulders of giants not ... shoulders of John Hume and David Trimble but also the shoulders of Jacques Delors who first came up with the plan and the idea of a peace programme for Northern Ireland to Helmut Kohl and to others.
I also call on us all to reflect and to remember the loss of life the harm and the impairment and injury that was done to so many but rather than laud those losses to continue to fester into poison or dialogue let us understand that was at one time and this is of another. Our task and role now is to ensure that our grandchildren can have better prospects for the future in Northern Ireland. Let us also remember the words of the old poet who said that even though my bones may break and even though my body may bleed within my heart still beats the hope of mankind to find and fulfil all its needs."
President Pottering said: "I would like to inform you that I have sent a letter to the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to congratulate them. We look forward to a good future for Northern Ireland, Ireland, Great Britain in the European Union."
Reports postponed to May II Plenary in Strasbourg
MEPs voted to postpone both the Brok report on Annual report 2005 on CFSP and the Lulling report (72 votes in favour to 64 against) on Alcohol and alcoholic beverages: adjust the minimum rates of excise duty to the May plenary in Strasbourg (21-24 May)

50 years of the EU: A celebration with European Nobel Prize winners at the European Parliament
2007-05-11 - 13:30
Ahead of today's plenary session the European Parliament held a special event to mark the 50th anniversary of the European Union. A group of European Nobel Prize winners was invited to take part in a debate on the past, present and future of the EU, focusing on its scientific, intellectual and cultural achievements. The proceedings were opened by Parliament's President, Hans-Gert Pöttering, who welcomed the guests and described briefly one of the reasons why each was of relevance to the European project, its values or the challenges facing it.
The efforts of Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan to promote peace in Northern Ireland highlighted the importance of reconciliation - a key to the history of post-war Europe. Amnesty International's tireless work for human dignity illustrated another "pillar of the European Union" as did Lech Walesa's struggle for human rights in Poland. Mr Pöttering mentioned his visit to Warsaw last week to mark the signing of "Europe's first written constitution", between Poland and Lithuania in 1791, saying that its values of peace and democracy were also those of Europe's future.
The work of physicist Carlo Rubbia was important to the modern search for clean energy, while Rita Levi-Montalcini's medical research had contributed greatly to cancer research. Jack Steinberger and Martinus Veltmann were not only leading physicists but also, respectively, a committed disarmament campaigner and a big supporter of Esperanto. Paul Josef Crutzen's work on ozone depletion was especially topical.
John Hume and David Trimble were lauded for their work on the Northern Ireland peace process. "What happened at Stormont yesterday is a testament to your achievements", said Mr Pöttering. Reinhard Selten's contribution to economics and Timothy Hunt's work in medical research were also outstanding examples of European research.
In all cases, said President Pöttering, "your work is built on a vision of the future, and on our 50th anniversary we too should be looking to the future". Mentioning the efforts of the German EU presidency to find a solution on the question of the constitutional treaty, he concluded: "we seek inspiration from the courage of the founding fathers" of the EU "but also from you, winners of the Nobel Prize, who have made such a tremendous contribution to Europe's achievements over the past 50 years. You should give us courage to work for a new breakthrough".
Each of the Nobel Prize winners then delivered a short speech to the assembled MEPs .
The first to speak was Rita LEVI-MONTALCINI, who was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1986 (along with Stanley Cohen) for their discoveries of growth factors. She believed that the EU's "enormous developments can be extended further, not just throughout Europe but across the whole planet". She wanted to see the "benefits of the EU spread to the whole world".
Prof. Sir Timothy HUNT jointly won the Noble Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2001 for the discovery of cyclins, a class of proteins. He told MEPs that after visits to Paris and Rome in his youth, he had "never understood those of my countrymen who have such a suspicious attitude to the rest of Europe". Turning to science, he praised "the advent of the ERC" (European Research Council), which he believed "promises to really strengthen European science" but he issued a general appeal for science to be free to pursue its own ends in academic institutions. He was also concerned that people were nowadays "afraid to excel", seeing this as an obstacle to scientific achievement. He concluded by saying "it is a shameful fact that among the top 20 universities in the world, 15 are in the US, 1 in Japan, 3 in the UK and 1 in Switzerland. Think about that!"
Prof. Reinhard SELTEN was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1994 for contributions to game theory. In his speech today he highlighted the success of economic and monetary union and stressed the importance of preserving the "independence of the ECB". He added that a major obstacle to a European identity was "the language problem", arguing that the answer was not the "domination of one national language" but for everyone to learn Esperanto.
Professor Carlo RUBBIA, who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1984, recalled that the EU was born out of the tragic events of the 20th century and the Second World War. He stressed the "indispensable and fundamental role of science in development". The European Union, he said, had strongly supported fundamental research in an international context. An example of this internationalism, he said was CERN: (The Organisation européenne pour la recherche nucléaire (English: European Organization for Nuclear Research). He listed the 22 European Member States of CERN plus the European Commission, India, Israel, Japan, Russia, Turkey, UNESCO and the USA.
Professor Martinus VELTMAN, who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1999, said that he was an enthusiastic supporter of Europe also citing the CERN example. "CERN has played an important role in my life". However, Professor Veltman did point out that CERN has only two working languages, namely English and French. He argued that this could be applied to the EU institutions as a "way of saving money" arguing that those that had created the euro would have "the sense to solve this problem". Professor Veltman also gave the example of the ease of building a personal computer in the US compared to the relative complexity in the EU. Finally, Professor Veltman quoted Jean-Paul Sartre who he said had said: "The suffering of the Palestinian people justified terrorism". Professor Veltman said "You should not boycott people living in a concentration camp".
Dick OOSTING, representing Amnesty International which won the Nobel Peace prize in 1977, said he felt "humble as the only laureate representing an organisation". He said "The EU has an important role to play as a peace project, a union based on values and as a force for change in the world." The challenges of climate change and security would have to be faced, "the EU must close the gap between values and attitudes, the EU needs to be credible". The non-respect for human rights, he said, risked undermining the EU's good efforts in the world, he concluded.
John HUME (a former MEP), who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998, called the European Union "the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution." It is based, he said, on three principles: Respect for difference, institutions which respect this difference and the healing process. The countries of the EU are "working together in their common interests." The same principles are "at the heart of the resolution in Northern Ireland", Mr Hume added, because the "identities of both communities are respected."
"We are in a stronger position to shape the forces of [the] world", Mr Hume continued, because "the world is a much smaller place." He added that "the essence of our unity is respect for our diversity" and that "the time has come to create a whole world which can be summed up by those...words." Respect for diversity, Mr Hume concluded, will lead to "no war, no conflict any more."
"Now that the position in Northern Ireland is in my view firmly and finally settled, we can join in this celebration without embarrassment" said Lord David TRIMBLE, winner of the Nobel Peace Price in 1998. "We must not build a world of competing blocs", Lord Trimble continued, and "we cannot ignore the divisions and conflicts that exist in various parts of the world."
Lord Trimble added that the "aid that we give should begin to enable economies elsewhere and societies elsewhere in the world to enter into the marketplace on an equal basis." "It would be tragic", Lord Trimble concluded, "if protectionism and locally powerful interest groups prevented Europe from making that progress which at the moment is just beyond our fingers' reach."
The co-recipient of the 1976 Nobel Peace Price, Mairead CORRIGAN MAGUIRE, expressed "tremendous solidarity with the people of Northern Ireland" and remarked that today was "surely a day for celebration and to give thanks because we are on the way to peace." Para-militarism, militarism and terrorism, "do not solve deep ethnic problems", Mrs Corrigan Maguire continued, challenging the role of armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, who are "struggling with the same problems [.]" Ms Corrigan Maguire concluded: "There are double standards going on here. What the Israelis are doing in Palestine is building an apartheid system. The European Parliament has a responsibility to do more than just pay lip service and rhetoric."
Elisabeth WILLIAMS, who was co-recipient of the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize, focused on the problem of child poverty, reminding the House that "every 6 seconds, somewhere in our world, a child dies of hunger and preventable diseases." It is time, she said, to "turn this unbearable situation of pain and death around." Mrs Williams called upon the European Parliament and her fellow laureates to help with this undertaking. "Common sense should tell us all that if we peace teach to future generations, then peace will indeed be practiced."
Lech WALESA, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, said that the European Union was on the "final straight" towards becoming fully united, but that "we have to come up with ideas worth of those from 50 years back", and in particular "a vision which will enable us to deal with the problems that come our way." Mr Walesa called for "10 commandments of values to solve all our problems." The EU, he said, has "taken a very material approach - tanks, missiles, business, dollars", and yet now is the time to focus on the common values held by the members of the European Union.
The ceremony ended with the playing of the European Hymn - Ode to Joy.

Blind-spot mirrors to be retrofitted to older lorries
2007-05-11 - 13:30
Parliament adopted a first-reading report approving with amendments a Commission draft directive calling for blind-spot mirrors to be "retrofitted" to heavy lorries which have been in operation since 2000. The deadline will be 31 March 2009. Each year, 400 Europeans - many of them children on bikes - are killed when lorry drivers changing direction at a crossing or roundabout fail to see them in a blind spot around the vehicle. Under a 2003 EU directive, new lorries must be equipped with blind-spot mirrors from 2007 onwards. However, at current replacement rates, the EU population of some 5 million lorries (not counting those owned in Romania and Bulgaria) would not be entirely replaced until 2023. Until then, the danger to vulnerable road users, particularly children, would continue.
The European Commission in this latest directive has therefore proposed retrofitting such mirrors to older lorries as well, i.e. those registered since 1 January 2000.
Parliament, in adopting a report drafted by Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT) endorsed the Commission's plans with amendments.
Parliament voted for the retrofitting exercise to be accompanied by awareness-raising campaigns about the dangers of blind spots on heavy goods vehicles, including information aimed at vulnerable road users. Light goods vehicles and buses are not covered by the directive but MEPs called for this question to be reviewed in future.
Parliament also voted for the Commission to gather data from Member States with a view to devising a future strategy on blind-spot accidents.
MEPs do not anticipate any practical problem in retrofitting lorries registered since 2000. The estimated cost would be € 100 - 150 per vehicle, i.e. the cost of one stop at a petrol station, but this measure could save up to 1,200 lives in Europe by 2020. Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark already have national retrofitting schemes.
Vehicles "operated mainly for their historical interest" will be exempted from these rules.
Parliament's amendments were the fruit of compromises between the EPP-ED, PES, ALDE and Greens/EFA groups and this co-decision legislation is now expected to be concluded at first reading.

Small manufacturers and disabled users to benefit from new road vehicle standards
2007-05-11 - 13:30
At a second-reading vote on Vehicle Type Approval, Parliament approved, with amendments, new rules on the manufacturing standards of road vehicles. These will raise environmental and safety standards as well as making it easier for producers to sell their vehicles Europe-wide. Thanks to MEPs, the legislation will take more account of the needs of disabled car users. European Community Vehicle Type Approval rules date back to the 1970s. The benefits include consistency of environmental and safety standards and a level playing field for companies wishing to sell across Europe, reducing potential barriers to trade.
Cars have been able to take advantage of a single European Type Approval legislation for a number of years; however the new legislation will introduce it for buses, coaches, trailers and trucks, where previously only national approval was available.
Overall this directive will have major benefits for vehicle safety, environmental performance and European competitiveness. It is a further important step in the completion of the internal market.
Higher safety standards
To obtain approval, manufacturers will have to comply with stricter technical requirements and some devices will become compulsory, including ABS (anti-blocking systems for brakes), new and more efficient rear mirrors, improved light-signalling, edge protection and anti-splashing devices for tyres.
Small manufacturers can produce more with simpler test procedures
The revised legislation will also benefit companies that produce cars at relatively low volumes - generally manufacturers of more specialist cars. They will now be able to produce 1000 cars per annum with simplified and less expensive test procedures; double the previous figure of 500. This will save small manufacturers from disproportionate costs and encourage newcomers to the market.
Special rules for wheelchair accessible vehicles
Under the new legislation, buses and coaches will have to provide easy access to persons with reduced mobility.
In amendments adopted - which had been agreed in advance with the Commission and Council by Parliament's rapporteur, Malcolm Harbour (EPP-ED, UK) - Parliament voted to ensure that wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs) have their own category of safety testing specifications, thereby giving them clear rules and unlimited production numbers.
According to Mr Harbour, "This is a fantastic result for the disabled consumer and for the manufacturers of these vehicles. We have given a boost to this important industry whilst ensuring that the safety of these vehicles is in no way compromised".
MEPs also voted to bring the directive into line with the new rules on comitology, to ensure Parliament has a say in any technical details decided after the legislation is passed.

Transport
More competition in public transport - but with safeguards
2007-05-11 - 13:30
Parliament approved with amendments, at a second-reading vote, new rules on public passenger transport services by rail and by road which seek to rebalance the award of contracts for these services between the public and private sectors. The aim of the regulation - which is prompted by the trend to greater involvement of the private sector in public transport - is to overhaul rules on the awarding of public service contracts for passenger transport by repealing old EU legislation and replacing existing national rules on competition in the public transport sector with standard Europe-wide rules.
EU rules will be laid down on: contracts between authorities and operators; compensation of operators for fulfilling public service requirements; exclusive rights; managing competition; and transparency.
Length of franchises
To prevent public authorities awarding long-term franchises to operators with whom they have close relationships, the Commission's original draft regulation proposed that firms be invited to tender for five-year contracts. At its first reading on 14 November 2001, Parliament voted for greater continuity for franchise contracts, saying they should be allowed to run for eight years for bus services and 15 years for rail services.
Member States finally agreed a common position within the Council after six years, in 2006. On the question of length of contracts, it followed Parliament's thinking but went even further, stipulating a maximum of ten years for contracts for coach and bus services (but still fifteen years for rail). Parliament today voted to endorse this position when it voted on a report by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL, NL) together with a package of compromise amendments agreed with the Council, which should mean that this legislation goes through without the need for a conciliation procedure.
Three options for awarding contracts
Under the new legislation, a local authority firstly has the option of providing public passenger transport services itself or awarding contracts directly to an "internal operator" (a legally distinct entity over which the authority exercises control similar to that exercised over its own departments).
A second option is to contract them out, issuing a call for tender if the services are above a certain size or value.
The third option - in the case of smaller contracts - is for the authorities to award public service contracts directly (i.e. without a call for tender). This will be allowed either where their average annual value is estimated at less than €1 million or where fewer than 300,000 kilometres of services are concerned.
However, special arrangements will apply to contracts directly awarded to smaller companies. Here Parliament changed the definitions. It decided that for small and medium-sized firms the figures should be less than €2 million (the Council proposed €1.7 million) and 600,000 kilometres (Council: 500,000). MEPs also said the definition of a small or medium-sized firm should be one operating not more than 23 vehicles (Council: 20).
Minimum standards for workers, passengers and the environment
MEPs also voted to allow the national authorities to lay down minimum quality and social standards for public service operators, e.g. regarding working conditions, passenger rights, the needs of persons with reduced mobility and environmental protection.
Lastly, MEPs voted for the regulation to enter into force within two years (Council: three years) and for the new rules to take effect within 10 years (Council: 12 years) of that entry into force.

Consumers
More choice of package sizes for shoppers
2007-05-11 - 13:30
Parliament gave qualified backing on 10 May to the Council's common position on a proposal to deregulate pack sizes for pre-packed products. Once the legislation is implemented, it will be possible to sell many everyday consumer products in a wider range of sizes than at present. By deregulating current rules for all but a few basic product groups, the EU is aiming to maximise competition and provide more freedom of choice for consumers. The legislation will permit industry to produce goods in a potentially infinite range of sizes by preventing Member States from legislating on pack sizes other than those still regulated by European law. There is no question of banning the pint of milk: producers will be free to determine what sizes should be sold.
Changing consumer needs
In the 1960s different national rules on nominal quantities of pre-packed products (pack/bottle sizes) were a major barrier to trade in such goods between the EC Member States. There was thus a need to harmonise these sizes.
For some products (e.g. wine, spirits) total harmonisation was introduced: Community sizes were made mandatory for everyone, i.e. all national sizes were abolished.
Given changes in the retail industry and consumer preferences, the European Union has taken a fresh look at the situation. The aim of the new directive is to relax the rules on pack sizes in general while keeping standard sizes for a limited range of products.
First reading: Parliament seeks more exemptions
In its draft legislation, the European Commission proposed retaining mandatory EU sizes for a handful of goods (spirits, wines, soluble coffee, white sugar and most products sold in aerosols).
At its first reading, Parliament welcomed the broad thrust of the legislation but voted to retain mandatory EU sizes for a further six product groups: drinking milk, butter, ground or unground roasted coffee, dried pasta, rice and brown sugar.
Second reading: MEPs seek to split the difference with Council
In its common position, the Council rejected Parliament's amendments, instead setting a transitional period of five years for phasing out existing national rules on sizes for domestic producers of milk, butter, coffee, dried pasta and rice, and six years for white sugar.
Voting today on the second-reading report by Jacques TOUBON (EPP-ED, FR), Parliament decided to accept most of these provisions but - following up on an issue vigorously pushed by British MEPs - spelt out the fact that existing sizes for pre-packed products (such as pre-packed bread) "will not be affected by this directive and can continue to be used". All the institutions agree that mandatory sizes should continue to apply to wines and spirits.
Parliament would also like the Commission to revisit the legislation at a later date in the light of market developments. And if the Commission notes "a disturbance of market conditions and/or a destabilisation of consumer behaviour" it "may authorise Member States to maintain transitional periods and, in particular, to maintain the most sold mandatory range sizes."
Parliament's position has already been accepted by the Member States' delegations to the Council, which is thus expected to approve the legislation as amended.

EU funding for better housing?
2007-05-11 - 13:30
A lack of decent, affordable housing directly affects EU citizens, by restricting their options for social integration and mobility, in both urban and rural areas. But in the new Member States, EU funding is already available to help with housing renovation and redevelopment and this possibility should be considered from 2009 for old Member States, too. So says an own-initiative report by Alfonso ANDRIA (ALDE, IT), which Parliament endorsed with 469 votes in favour, 38 against and 46 abstentions on 10 May 2007.
Many European cities face soaring housing purchase and maintenance costs. Yet, at the same time, urban sprawl is adding to mobility problems (congested public transport, reliance on private cars) energy consumption, and pollution.
Although the EU has no specific powers over housing, the European Regional Development Fund regulation for 2007-2013 would allow structural aid for housing in urban (re-)development projects, in areas of the new Member States that are threatened by physical deterioration or social exclusion, says the report.
This EU funding could help to revive urban areas with an integrated mix of measures to redevelop public areas, improve safety and prevent delinquency, and use water and energy more efficiently.
For fifteen countries that were in the EU before 2004, the report seeks to reopen debate on "extending access to Community funds for renovation of social housing to all Member States, in order to save energy and protect the environment, currently foreseen only for certain countries, given that housing needs are critical throughout Europe."
Structural fund aid should form part of an integrated strategy on housing, so as to ensure that any steps to promote access to housing, improve building quality, improve the quality of life and enhance the attractiveness of urban and rural environments are taken simultaneously.
The report advocates, inter alia, identifying EU-wide minimum quality indicators defining "adequate housing" strengthening the right to housing benefit so as to ease worker mobility and giving cities a greater role in planning and managing the use of structural funds for housing projects
It also encourages the EIB group and the Commission to establish a strategy for boosting the building sector, chiefly in the new Member States, which would constitute structural aid for developing housing and mobilise local and regional resources geared to urban projects.

Regional policy recipe for EU innovative capacity
2007-05-11 - 13:30
Providing equal access to education at all levels ensuring that thinkers have very cheap (or free) broadband internet access to scientific, economic, legal, cultural and administrative information, enforcing intellectual property rights and fostering cross-border co-operation among regional academic and business stakeholders are key ways in which regional policy makers can help build the EU's innovative capacity, So says an own-initiative report by Mieczyslaw Edmund Janowski (UEN, PL), adopted by Parliament in plenary session on 10 May.
Joined-up thinking
Innovation is a "dynamic and interactive process [...] including regional and local stakeholders" says the report. So regional policy can help build the EU's innovation capacity, by combining measures in a wide variety of fields, e.g. scientific and technological, legal and financial, economic and commercial, organisational and administrative, and educational and social.
The report, inter alia:
· calls on Member States and the Commission to ensure in the EU regions equal opportunities for all citizens to access education at every level, which would boost people's ability to think in an innovative, creative way and help them to develop "ethical and pro-social behaviour patterns" ;
· calls on the Commission, Member States, regional and local authorities to maximise access to information and communication technology-based working ;
· calls on the Commission and Member States to foster the development of "clusters", as a means of establishing links among scientific research centres, education centres, business and local communities ;
· urges Member States to foster co-operation by setting up European technological platforms [...] to concentrate innovation activities by forging cross-border and cross-regional links between industry and business and scientific research and financial circles;
· calls on the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities for comprehensive support [...] to small and medium-sized enterprises (including streamlining administrative procedures, the tax system and public supply procedures), since they are " the most creative and dynamic vehicles for technological and organisational innovation" and
· calls on the Council, the Commission and Member States to set up financing mechanisms that meet real needs, together with a system for managing the risks involved in innovative projects, and stresses the need to publicise the EIB/EIF financing initiatives JASPERS, JEREMIE and JESSICA at regional level .

Human rights must be a core principle of EU-Russia relations say MEPs
2007-05-11 - 13:30
Russia remains an important partner for Europe, especially in energy relations, but this relationship must set democratic values and human rights as its core principle, says a resolution adopted by a large majority in the EP. The lifting of Russia's ban on Polish agricultural products is another demand of the House. On Estonia, it calls on Russia to "fully respect its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations," guaranteeing the protection of embassies and diplomats. The House reiterated its support for Russia's WTO membership, and welcomed the initiatives to achieve visa-free travel between the EU and Russia. It also welcomed intensified dialogue on energy issues, and stressed that equal access to infrastructure and investment, as well as "the principles of interdependence and transparency should be the basis" of cooperation in the energy field. These principles should be applied to major energy infrastructure projects, such as the Baltic gas pipeline.
However, MEPs expressed deep concern about the use of force by Russian authorities against protesters in Moscow and St. Petersburg and reiterated that "a robust defence of human rights and democratic values should be a core principle of any EU engagement with Russia". They also worried about continuing reports of the use of torture in prisons in Chechnya and the restriction of democratic freedoms, for instance, the freedom of the media, in the run-up to the upcoming elections, MEPs also want to halt the process of depriving some political parties of their legal status and their eligibility to participate in the upcoming legislative and presidential elections.
Anti-ballistic missile system
The House expresses its concern about declarations made by President Putin in reaction to the United States' plans to deploy components of its anti-ballistic missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic. MEPs demand a thorough discussion of these proposals, including the need for them, a threat assessment and the possibility of different areas of security both in the EU and NATO frameworks.
Polish meat and Estonian bronze
The Parliament welcomes the common line taken by the EU on the lifting of Russia's ban on Polish agricultural products (oral amendment moved by Charles Tannock (EPP-ED, UK)), which has blocked negotiations on a new EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation agreement (PCA). The House also expects that Russia will lift the embargo on some Moldovan and Georgian products, such as wine.
The resolution also calls on the EU to "demonstrate solidarity with Estonia and speak with one voice in the context of recent events in Tallinn," and calls on Russia to "fully respect its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations," guaranteeing the protection of embassies and diplomats.

Arab world reform: a European perspective
2007-05-11 - 13:30
Any outside attempt to impose reforms, without the partner countries having a sufficient stake in the processes and means employed to achieve them, “is bound to fail”. This, for the European Parliament, was the point of departure for an own-initiative report -- drafted by Michel ROCARD (PES, FR) - on “Reforms in the Arab world: what strategy should the European Union adopt?”, endorsed by a wide majority of MEPs. As MEPs see it, the EU – in defining its position on Arab world reform – must take into account cultural, historical and political differences, respecting, at the same time, the will of the Arab people. Forcing them to copy European models, argues the report, “may prove to be counterproductive" change, in order to be legitimate, must be supported by the peoples concerned. Supporting the development of civil society and respect for fundamental rights, the report underlines, “must not be confused with the choice of regime nor with the procedures for choosing leaders”.
Given that the weakness of the reform effort in the Arab world results partially from disputes between various states, reads the report, “the EU should make every effort to facilitate the political and economic integration of the Arab countries”. It should avoid, in doing so, “any feeling of superiority or the impression of giving lessons.”
Encouraging reform
Keeping in mind such provisos, the report goes on to urge the Commission “to give more encouragement in the Arab world to the movement for the reform of the rule of law by legal means” and to “political reform seeking to legalise the action of opposition movements on the basis of the existing institutions.” Citing the need to engage with reform movements at the regional level, the report also calls for Europe “to give visible political support to the actors in civil society, in associations and in religious life, and in particular to those political organisations which promote liberal democracy by non-violent means, excluding sectarian, fundamentalist and extremist nationalist forces but including where appropriate, secular actors, in particular secular Islamists". The EP draws a line on this issue, however, noting that efforts to engage with the Arab world “should not include persons, organisations' and states which condone terrorist activities and deny the State of Israel’s legal right to exist.” That said, the report "welcomes" the Saudi peace initiative approved in March summit of the Arab League and calls on the Council "to deal with this proposal at the next meeting of the Quartet".
“The current path of political Islam does not appear to be providing appropriate answers to the problems of political reform”, the report notes elsewhere. MEPs hope that Arab countries can "guarantee the independence and separation of institutions and political power from the religious authorities".
In their report, MEPs also address questions of religion in the Arab world and the fight against terrorism. On the first of these, the report expresses its hope “for greater commitment on the part of Arab countries to religious freedom, or the right of individuals and communities to freely profess their beliefs and practise their faith.” On the second – while acknowledging that the fight against terrorism is an important aspect of the Euro-Arab relationship – the report notes that it is vital “that the fight against terrorism does not overshadow or hold back a host of other topics of common interest.”
In that vein, the Parliament calls on the EU to encourage exchanges of students, teachers, academics and researchers between European and Arab countries and to facilitate such exchanges “through an adapted and more flexible visa regime”.

Horn of Africa : MEPs call for "African solutions"
2007-05-11 - 13:30
A report on the war-ravaged Horn of Africa (Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda) was adopted with amendments with MEPs asking for "African solutions" to stabilise the region. They also call for consolidation of the EU presence through the appointment of an EU special representative. MEPs doubt that in a region where five out of seven countries are in conflict with their neighbours, where Somalia has been lacking a functioning government for the last 15 years, where the percentage of the population below poverty is more than 22 % the concept of regional partnership work as a "cure-all" for such a complex inter-related issue.
The House believes that, in its efforts to address the crisis in the Horn of Africa region, the EU should seek African solutions, with the involvement of the regional organisations in place, the African Union (AU) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). These organisations should be strengthened through the EU-funded African Peace Facility able to provide the necessary resources.
According to MEPs, the Commission and the Council should to start a consultation process with the UN, AU, IGAD, Arab League, USA and China, on the initiative of convening a Comprehensive Security Peace and Development Conference to deal with the security concerns of all Horn of Africa States simultaneously.
MEPs deplore the fact that neither the European Parliament nor the Parliaments of the African countries, nor the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, nor civil society representatives were duly consulted at any stage of the formulation of the EU-Africa Strategy adopted in December 2005.
The fight against HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, as well as neglected diseases and female genital mutilation, must be one of the key strategies for eradicating poverty according to the House.

MEPs call for modernisation of European legislation on consultation and information of workers
2007-05-11 - 13:30
In adopting a joint resolution of the PES, ALDE and Greens/EFA groups on strengthening European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers, MEPs call on the Commission to review and update European legislation concerning consultation and information of workers, in order to ensure a coherent and efficient framework of law, guarantee legal certainty and improve the articulation of social dialogue between the national and the European levels. The European Parliament calls on the Commission to present it with a timetable for the review and modernisation of European legislation on information and consultation, on collective redundancies, on safeguarding employees’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings and, especially, on the long-awaited revision of the Directive on European Works Councils (EWCs).
The House calls on the Commission to take prompt action to ensure that proper implementation takes place in the Member States as regards information and consultation of workers and to notify those Member States where information and consultation directives are not implemented.
MEPs note in particular that Directive 94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of European Works Councils is either not being implemented at all or that there are large and unjustified discrepancies between the ways that Member States choose to implement it. MEPs call on the Commission to report rapidly and in full to the European Parliament and to notify Member States where required.
Finally, the European Parliament calls on the Commission, therefore, to improve further the coordination of its policies in the various fields, including social affairs, economic and monetary affairs, industry, and research and development, and to encourage the social partners to take an active part in developing a coherent set of policies aimed at maintaining a strong, innovative and competitive European industry.
Philip BUSHILL-MATTHEWS (EPP-ED, UK) said that although his group was not a signatory to the resolution, the EPP-ED group agreed with the thrust of the resolution and would vote in favour.

Petitions
MEPs urge Denmark to act over 1968 nuclear air crash
2007-05-11 - 13:30
Parliament voted by 544 votes to 29, with 40 abstentions, in favour of a resolution tabled by the Petitions Committee calling on Denmark to take belated action in relation to the alleged health consequences of the 1968 crash in Greenland of a US plane carrying nuclear bombs. On 21 January 1968, a US B-52 bomber with several nuclear weapons on board crashed near the Thule Air Base in North-Western Greenland, releasing several kilos of weapons grade plutonium. The plutonium contaminated the immediate snow and ice at the crash site and was carried by high winds and water over an extensive area.
After clean-up operations - in which Danish workers volunteered to participate alongside US personnel - the US conducted regular medical monitoring of its air force staff. No similar monitoring was conducted by the Danish Government of the Danish civilian workers or the Greenlanders, many of whom continued to work at the Thule base and live in the area for several years thereafter.
Petition to the European Parliament
Parliament has taken up this issue as the result of a petition sent in by a Mr Jeffrey Carswell, who was involved in arranging for the removal of contaminated debris, was later diagnosed with cancerous conditions relating to the oesophagus and stomach and has had eight major operations. He argues that his health problems are linked to radiation contamination following the crash and that many Thule survivors developed similar radiogenic conditions.
Mr Carswell complains that the Danish authorities failed to evacuate the workers from the site at the time, to warn them or to inform them about the extensive radiation, or to make the necessary follow-up medical tests and examinations, as required by Council Directive 96/29/Euratom on safety standards relating to ionising radiation. He also says Denmark has refused to allow public access to the 1968 scientific records of the case.
Euratom Treaty does apply in this case, says Parliament
A key legal question is whether the Euratom Treaty applies to this case, as Denmark was not a member of Euratom in 1968. Both the European Commission and Denmark have consistently refused to recognise the applicability of this treaty. Parliament today backed the view of its Petitions Committee that the treaty does apply. In its resolution, Parliament says it "doubts that the Kingdom of Denmark has fully complied with its obligations under Directive 96/29/Euratom in relation to the Thule crash and its after-effects". It therefore calls on Denmark to initiate surveillance and intervention measures in relation to the after-effects of the crash and to make arrangements for the monitoring of exposure.
MEPs also call on the European Commission to bring forward a proposal addressing the public health and environmental implications of the use of nuclear energy for military purposes, given that existing EU law appears to be lacking in this area.
