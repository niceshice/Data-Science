Climate meltdown: ice statues in Poznań drove the global warming message home A series of ice statues symbolizing the dangers of global warming welcomed delegates to the climate change conference taking place in Poznań this week. The aim of the meeting is to get a post-Kyoto deal on fighting global warming. The deadline for reaching agreement on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol expires in December 2009.
A group of 36 MEPs were there to consider issues including who will pay for a global climate change incentive and how developing countries should adapt in line with developed nations.
The meeting comes just ahead of the Parliament's December plenary, when MEPs are expected to agree a series of stringent Europe-wide rules on cutting CO2 emissions and improving energy efficiency
Poor and rich countries have "different responsibilities"
Italian Socialist and chairman of the EP's Tempoary Committee on Climate Change, Guido Sacconi, said the Polish conference was "an opportunity to meet and influence delegates from around the world."
Fellow delegate, Slovenian Christian democrat, Romana Jordan Cizelj said, "developed and developing countries have different responsibilities and different capacities. We have to have a strong sense that we all are important and involved in the process".
Strasbourg Session key for European action
Three of the six proposals in the EU's energy and climate package have already been agreed including renewables, CO2 emissions and fuel quality.
The greenhouse gas emission trading system (ETS) and geological storage of carbon dioxide are still being negotiated by the European Parliament and EU countries
MEPs will vote on the climate package during next week's plenary in Strasbourg.
