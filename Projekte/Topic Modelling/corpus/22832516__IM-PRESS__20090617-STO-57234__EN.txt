64 on Friday, Burma's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has spent most of the last 20 years under House arrest. The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering has spoken out about the impending trial of Burma's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. "I strongly urge Myanmar's military rulers to release her immediately and unconditionally" he said. The dissident has spent almost two decades of being under house arrest with only occasional periods of freedom. On Friday she celebrates her 64th birthday.
In 1990 MEPs marked her courage by awarding her the Parliament's Sakharov human rights Prize for her resistance. The following year she was awarded the Nobel peace prize. As recently as last year the European Parliament passed a resolution condemning her imprisonment and calling for her immediate release.
In his remarks Mr Pöttering said : "I appeal for a fair and transparent trial in accordance with international standards, which include full media access and the possibility of all witnesses to testify."
All 27 countries of the EU have collectively called for her release and her case is likely to be discussed when European leaders meet Thursday and Friday in Brussels.
Sentence in trial could coincide with 64th birthday
Her supporters have organised a special campaign to mark her 64th birthday and are calling on her trial to cease and for her to be released from house arrest in Rangoon.
In 1990 her party won the general elections but the Generals who run Burma arrested her and refused to accept the poll. Since then she has been under virtual house arrest. Her latest trial comes after an American man swam to her house (which backs on to a lake). The ruling military Junta have used this as an excuse to try her for breaking the terms of her arrest.
House arrest has involved no travel or communication with the outside world and separation from her children and estrangement from her husband, who died in Britain while she was still in Burma.
Mr Pöttering finished by paying tribute to her fortitude : "The European Parliament...reaffirms its complete support and solidarity with Aung San Suu Kyi. This courageous woman represents the best hopes of her people for a free and prosperous future."
