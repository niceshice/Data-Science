"Who's who?" Visitors go through the seating plan: Members sit in political groups and opposite ends of the political spectrum face one another in the semi-circular Chamber. Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering shares a huddled moment with an aide, Tuesday, 21 April. Wednesday, 22 April: MEPs mill around the Chamber prior to taking their place for votes. Every seat in the Chamber has a desk, a place to keep documents, earphones to listen to interpretation, a microphone and a voting machine. Many key votes take place on Wednesday between 12:00 and 1:00. There are some 1200 journalists accredited to the EP. After obtaining a permit camera crews can film plenary sessions at all times. Filming in Parliament's restaurants and bars is not allowed however. 27 EU countries means 23 official languages: Interpretation is available for all debates. As well as MEPs, representatives the European Commission and the Council of the European Union (seen here) often also present their views in debates. Jean-Paul Gauzès (right), rapporteur on Credit Rating Agencies, makes his point to a colleague outside the Chamber. European Parliament, Strasbourg, 23 April 2009. Since 1999 it has held week-long sessions once a month. Two-day sessions and Committee and group meetings take place in Brussels. In the penultimate session of the current parliamentary term, MEPs backed new measures to cap roaming charges and to strengthen consumer choice by liberalising Europe's energy market and making access to hospital treatment abroad easier. The heart of the European Parliament is its semi-circular Chamber in Strasbourg where Members debate the key issues of the day. Glimpse some of the personalities behind the stories.
