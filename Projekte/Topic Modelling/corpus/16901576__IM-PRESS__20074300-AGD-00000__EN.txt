Committee on Transport and Tourism
The Transport Committee is likely to adopt in January 2008 the report by Silvia-Adriana TICAU (PES, RO) on a directive aiming at establishing common rules to pursue the occupation of road transport operator. It replaces an existing directive and four regulations. The problem encountered is that existing legislation is not applied uniformly, which had a detrimental effect on competition. The new directive has stricter rules and criteria on establishing companies in Member States and monitoring them. This directive is part of a package which includes two other reports: one on access to the road transport market and one on access to the market for coach and bus services. Mrs TICAU will present her report in Committee in November. At this hearing, all parties concerned will give their view on the Commission proposals.
