Jo Leinen, head of the EP delegation, at a bike event in Copenhagen: "By summer 2010 there must be deal for a new legally binding agreement." "The atmosphere is cold not only outside in Copenhagen, but also inside the Bella Centre," said the head of EP delegation Jo Leinen arriving in Copenhagen on Monday. Four days later, on the eve of the end of the conference it is still unclear where the complex negotiations will lead. Some 120 world leaders will make a final decision tomorrow.
"Chaotic" is how the participants describe the atmosphere inside Bella Centre where 15,000 participants and over 1,400 journalists have gathered. That's if they were able to enter - the queues outside the centre in freezing temperatures are 5-6 hours.
Indians, Africans, NGOs and ministers from all over the world rush from one meeting to another with messages on how to save the world from the disastrous consequences of climate changes. A huge balloon illustrates the volume of 1 tonne of CO2.
US, China tough negotiators
After days of negotiations, the high-level phase of the talks began with the environment ministers and negotiators from 193 countries on Tuesday. The 120 heads of state and governments, including US President Barack Obama, arrive today and tomorrow.
Karl-Heinz Florenz, the vice-chair of the EP delegation to COP15, describes the US and China as tough negotiators. "Another problem is that the G77 (developing countries) are not speaking with one voice."
Waiting for the breakthrough
The 15-strong EP delegation has been following the negotiations closely since Monday and hopes for a breakthrough. They have met with the EU presidency and MEPs from India, China, Brazil and Japan.
Negotiations at stalemate
Mr Florenz said in an EP Facebook chat yesterday: "We are at a critical point in the negotiations...we have to stop this game if you go forward, then we follow. Everyone has to go forward."
Jo Leinen, the chair of EP delegation said today: "The post-Copenhagen process will be as important as Copenhagen. By summer 2010 there must be deal for a new legally binding agreement."
EU must stand firm
He said the EU must stand firm on its climate change objectives. "Weakening the 30% target would put Europe's leadership in the climate negotiations into question ...and would encourage other states to move their climate protection targets."
Thursday EP President Jerzy Buzek goes to Copenhagen and the EP will provide an overview of existing and planned '"cap and trade" systems, including the EU emission trading system (ETS) and the planned "cap and trade" scheme in the US.
