The Human Rights Subcommittee elected, by acclamation, MEP Barbara Lochbihler (Greens/EFA, DE) as its new chairwoman, replacing Finnish Green MEP Heidi Hautala, who resigned in June to become Finland's minister for development.
"Although there are plenty of human rights activities within the European institutions we still can do better. There is a clear lack of co-ordination of human rights activities, not only within the European Parliament, but also with regard to the human rights activities of the Commission and the Council", said Ms Lochbihler, who is also the chair of the EP delegation for the relations with Iran.
"The ongoing international discussions on the death penalty, torture, discrimination, the rule of law, the fight against impunity, social, cultural and economic rights are a clear signal that there is practically no field in human life that is not related to human rights and democratic freedom", she added.
Before being elected to the European Parliament, Ms Lochbihler was Amnesty International's secretary-general in Germany.
