MEPs demand a European Year to fight violence against women
Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Plenary sittings
2010-09-09 - 12:38
A call to establish a "European Year of Combating Violence against Women", within the next five years, has been backed by a majority of MEPs, who signed up to a written declaration urging the Commission to take action.
Between 20% and 25% of women in the EU suffer physical violence in their adult life and over 10% are victims of sexual violence. Violence against women is one of the most widespread human rights violations and a major obstacle to gender equality.
A written declaration signed by over half the Members of the European Parliament (369 MEPs or more) has the same standing as an adopted resolution, in that it represents an official position of Parliament.
