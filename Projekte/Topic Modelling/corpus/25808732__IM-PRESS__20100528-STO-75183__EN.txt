Bank managers' pay packages contributed to the crisis, MEPs say ©BELGA_imagebroker_Harry Hart A report by Belgian Socialist Saïd El Khadraoui underlines the role of executive compensation in the financial industry in the making of the financial and economic crisis. Excessive levels of risk seen at many banks and hedge funds can be explained by the drive of managers of these institutions to increase profits fast and get rich in the process.
The European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee debated the report on remuneration of directors of listed companies and remuneration policies in the financial services sector on 1 June. It will be voted upon on 22 June and in plenary in July.
The report says that leading managers of financial institutions were encouraged to engage in excessive and imprudent risk-taking, because the size of their pay checks depended on such behaviour. The report proposes to remedy this with following measures:
every financial institution and listed company should have a remuneration committee which determines the remuneration policy
members of the committee should not hold executive functions, their pay should be fixed, not based on performance of the businesses they supervise
firms should allow shareholders to have information on pay packages and have their say
there should be an appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation, the latter not making more than 50% of the total
Mr El Khadraoui told the meeting that the report needs to be strong in addressing remuneration issues, "as the latter can lead to dangerous behaviour, sending out a powerful signal is essential".
Polish MEP Sławomir Witold Nitras from the centre right European People's Party welcomed the part of the report which linked pay to the long term performance of the company.
Finnish Liberal Carl Haglund underlined the need for EU regulations on pay to be in line with discussions in international fora such as the G20. He supports greater transparency of pay packages vis-a-vis shareholders, but said any rules on that should be voluntary "trade unions should be left out" he said.
British Conservative Vicky Ford warned that smaller companies should not be burdened with the establishment of remuneration boards in the same manner as bigger companies
Belgian Liberal Wolf Klinz made the point that if you deal just with executive board members' pay, you don't solve the problem, as some traders in investment banks earn much more than senior managers.
He warned that there is great deal of political pressure to do something on pay, but that companies can always find loopholes.
Finally, British Socialist Arlene McCarthy said, "citizens have money in banks, so we should care about excessive risk taking".
She went on to say that "excessive risks were being taken to make excessive profits". She quoted research by Stefan Walter, the Secretary General of the Basel Committee, Bank for international settlements (BIS) saying that banks would have had enough capital to cope with losses from the crisis had they not paid out such big bonuses.
