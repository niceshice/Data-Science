Collection and management of data on the Common Fisheries Policy

The House adopted a report on the collection and management of data on the Common Fisheries Policy. The European Parliament approves a Commission proposal amending Regulation 1543/2000, which establishes a Community framework for the collection and management of the data needed to conduct the Common Fisheries Policy. The report was adopted with 382 votes in favour, 11 against and 5 abstentions.
In the light of new thinking on fisheries management and to prepare for a maritime policy for the EU, the Commission proposes that this regulation is repealed and replaced by a new more comprehensive data collection regulation.
The new regulation should enter into force in 2008. However, in the interim, it is necessary to amend the existing Regulation 1543/2000 in order to prevent an overlap between the old and the new regulation and to avoid any unnecessary administrative burdens on the Member States and the Commission.
Specifically, this will obviate the present legal obligation on Member States to submit six-year national programmes for the collection and management of data from 2007 to 2012, according to rules that are soon to be replaced. Instead, transitional programmes covering the years 2007 and 2008 are to be drawn up.
The current Commission proposal makes these necessary changes and is consequently supported by the rapporteur, Paulo Casaca (PES, PT), without amendment.
