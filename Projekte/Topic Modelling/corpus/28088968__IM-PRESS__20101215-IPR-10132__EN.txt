Parliament underlines the need to deepen dialogue with the Commission so as to improve the obvious link between policy priorities and the budget, with a view to funding them at EU level. It assesses the Commission work programme for 2011 in a resolution drafted by the EPP, S&D and ALDE groups and passed by a show of hands in plenary on Wednesday.
Parliament urges the Commission to commit itself to performing a "realistic and operational" programming exercise which it says must be effective, translated into reality and better implemented than in the past. It asks for a clearer timetable of major proposals to be put forward.
MEPs note that efforts so far to resolve the financial crisis and sustain Europeâ€™s economic recovery have fallen way below what is necessary, and they deplore the fact that the work programme does not include additional measures to create more jobs.
Parliament nonetheless welcomes the priority given to reforming European economic governance. It warns that unless the EU can develop credible economic governance, the future of the euro will be in jeopardy.
MEPs reiterate that Parliament and the Council, as the two arms of the budgetary authority, should be equally involved in any mobilisation of the European Financial Stability Mechanism. They ask that proposals be presented rapidly to make the crisis resolution mechanism permanent.
The resolution also urges the Commission to bring forward proposals rapidly to revise the current financial framework and adds that the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period after 2013 must also reflect the increased scope of EU responsibilities.
Finally, Parliament strongly urges the Commission to come forward, in June 2011, with bold and innovative proposals for a substantive revision of the own-resources system, following the approval of Parliament's position on the new Multiannual Financial Framework.
