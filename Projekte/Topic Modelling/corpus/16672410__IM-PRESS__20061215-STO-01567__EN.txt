Mauri Pekkarinen and Josep Borrell sign the directive
The Services directive, a fiercely debated piece of EU legislation aimed at rejuvenating Europe's enormous services sector, was finally signed into law last week. The ceremony took place in Strasbourg with Parliament's President Josep Borrell and Finnish Minister of Trade Mauri Pekkarinen signing the text. They represent the two "arms" of the law making process - elected MEPs and the Council of EU Ministers representing the 25 EU governments.
Parliament finally approved the law in November after more than two years of debate and revision between the Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission. It is one of the most important texts to be agreed by the EU in recent years, since it aims to make the "free movement" of services around the EU a reality.
Social and legal protection of consumers guaranteed
Parliament agreed with the aim of opening up the services sector, but wanted to ensure that the opening of the services market would not affect basic social standards in the EU nor reduce legal protection for consumers and firms in case of a possible dispute.
The draft of the directive was presented to the Parliament and the Council in 2004. Its aim was to give real shape to one of the fundamental European freedoms laid in the Treaties - free movement of services. To make it possible, the administrative, legal, bureaucratic and protectionist chains have to be removed.
A balance of interests
The final directive, substantially rewritten by Parliament, attempts to balance the positions of the enthusiasts of more liberalisation and those who fear a decline in social protection. It is an attempt to strike a balance between the interests of consumers, workers and service providers.
The services directive belongs to the field covered by the codecision procedure and will enter into force by 2010 at the latest.
