The European Commission pledged €522 million at the International Donor Conference in New York in March 2010, of which €395 million have been committed so far and the payments made until the end of 2011 amount to €210 million.
The delegation includes Ingeborg Grässle (Leader, EPP, DE), Jean-Pierre Audy (EPP, FR), Jens Geier (S&D, DE), Ivailo Kalfin (S&D, BG), Ryszard Czarnecki (ECR, PL) and Martin Ehrenhauser (N-A, A). They will meet politicians, officials involved in managing the funds, and also representatives of NGOs, international finance institutions and the UN. MEPs will also visit a disaster response management training centre and the Champ de Mars site in front of the destroyed presidential palace that now accommodates 20.000 displaced people with help of EU money.
Critical report
The visit comes just a month after the adoption of a critical report on EU humanitarian aid management, prepared by one of the delegation members, Martin Ehrenhauser (non-attached, AT). In their resolution, MEPs called for more efficiency and less bureaucracy in aid management by the Commission's Humanitarian Aid Directorate-General (DG ECHOE) while at the same timing ensuring a high level of accountability and transparency of humanitarian aid. They pointed - as on other occasions - to weaknesses in transparency, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness of UN management of EU funds.
The delegation's findings will feed into the annual discharge report on Commission spending and the discharge of the European Development Funds.
