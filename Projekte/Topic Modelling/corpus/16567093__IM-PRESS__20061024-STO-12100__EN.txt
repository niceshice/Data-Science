Information sharing in the Schengen zone was debated
The first day of the October Plenary session was marked by debates on the Schengen Information system (SIS) and the role of immigrant women in the EU. The SIS allows information exchange in the EU's border-free Schengen area - extending it to new EU members is a key issue. MEPs later heard that human rights violations are common among immigrant woman in the EU. Parliament's internal market committee also approved the second reading of the Services Directive, which will be voted on in November.
Schengen Information System
MEPs debated a package of measures setting rules for the new version of the information system, which will include the 10 new EU members in the electronic exchange of data. The rapporteur, Carlos Coelho of the European People's Party, supports the proposal of the Commission. "This is a good result for Europe, we will have more security and more protection of data" he said. The issue will be put to the vote on Wednesday.
The role and place of immigrant women in the EU
According to the rapporteur, Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (Greek member of the European People's Party), the problems concerning immigrant women are: discrimination in the workplace, in education (as regards recognition of diplomas and professional skills), violation of human rights (violence and sexual abuse), religious stereotypes, forced weddings, trafficking of human beings and mutilation of genital organs. This report has just been adopted.
Others debates included the Protection of the environment and the civil protection mechanism.
Services Directive
On Monday evening, Parliament's Internal Market Committee approved without amendment the second reading version of the Services Directive put forward by the Council, which itself largely followed the first reading position adopted by Parliament in February. The directive should now be put to the vote at the November plenary session in Strasbourg.
