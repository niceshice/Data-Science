More than 10% of EU children affected
It is estimated that more than 10% of European children are affected by "dys-"type disorders, including dysphasia, dyspraxia, attention deficit disorder and dyslexia. MEPs Wednesday asked the Commission and Council to draw up a charter for dys children, and to encourage the recognition of dys-type problems as a handicap.
MEPs want to promote the creation of a European multidisciplinary network on specific learning difficulties to collect and study information and encourage the coordination of cross-border action and institutional dialogue on these problems, which can impair communication from an early age.
A written declaration, sponsored by a cross-party group of MEPs and signed by 412 MEPs to date, calls for the sharing of best practices by:
making information accessible
taking timely steps to spot, screen, systematically diagnose and treat the disorders at an early stage
providing special, early, intensive and multidisciplinary treatment in appropriate structures in schools or specialised establishments
finding ways to integrate young people with these disabilities into the world of work.
The Declaration will be formally adopted by the parliament during the November plenary session.
Written declarations
A group of up to five MEPs can use written declarations to launch or relaunch a debate on a subject that comes within the EUâ€™s remit. The text, if signed by a majority of MEPs, is forwarded to the President, who announces it in plenary. It is then forwarded to the institutions named.
