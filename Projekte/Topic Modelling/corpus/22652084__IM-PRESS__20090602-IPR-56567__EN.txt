Ahead of the 4-7 June elections, the European Parliament has set up an election micro-blog on Twitter in the European Union's 22 official languages to keep people up to speed on preparations for the Europe-wide poll. These special election "tweets" will feature news and behind the scenes information about the run up to voting and regular updates of breaking news on election results night, Sunday 7 June.
Started three years ago, the micro-blogging service Twitter allows you to share thoughts, news and experiences with friends and all those who choose to follow you. Fancy following the elections on Twitter? Come and find us in English at "EU_Elections_en".
