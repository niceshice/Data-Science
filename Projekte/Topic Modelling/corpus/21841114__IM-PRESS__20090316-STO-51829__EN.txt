Consumer protection - look back at some EP measures
2009 elections
Consumers

2 pieces of wrapped chicken - the question is how much labelling do we need? In an ideal world, the consumer would be king. Today's consumer is alas often a victim - left feeling helpless and frustrated. One the keys areas where the European Parliament can make a difference is consumers rights in everything from product labelling, toy safety, roaming charges for mobiles phones to compensation for late trains. As June's European elections draw closer we have a look at some consumer issues.
If you...eat and drink , you might approve of your sugar, butter and coffee being sold in a wide range of package sizes and your vodka being made of any agricultural product (provided this is clearly indicated in the label)! As recently as March 2009, the EP debated new rules on labelling clearly indicating the place where food products and the ingredients in them were produced and processed, so that you can make informed choices when buying a product.
If you call a lot when travelling abroad you might have noticed lower bills for making and receiving calls in other EU countries, thanks to the "Eurotariff" backed by the European Parliament.
Travel by plane or train: You have probably seen the clearer indication of all taxes, fees and charges added to your flight ticket price and benefit from continually reinforced rail passenger rights (such as compensation for train delays).
If you have a family and are concerned for its safety you should know that toys will be safer in the future because of rules and standards set by the European Parliament. MEPs have also passed new laws expected to reduce the number of accidents due to the misuse of fireworks and tightened laws on gun ownership by under 18s.
Watching TV , you may have views on the number and frequency of commercials breaks or on "product placement" - famous brands all over your films! MEPs do too. They have set new and stricter rules on commercials aimed at children and for product placement, which come into force this year.
If you are doing any of the things we mention , you might have appreciated the relevant EU legislation...or not. You may be happy with the way things are or want the EU to do more, or less, for you. Tell the EU what you want by choosing your representatives with your vote at the June 2009 elections .
