Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee heard a report today from Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL, CY), chair of the EP delegation for relations with the Palestinian National Council, about the working party which went to Palestine from 29 April to 3 May 2007. The delegation called for an end to the political and economic embargo imposed since the victory of Hamas at the legislative elections in January 2006.
Mr Triantaphyllides said the delegation, which met the Palestinian Prime Minister, Isma√Øl Haniyeh, had expressed the view that "the political and economic embargo must be lifted since the new government of national unity - made up of representatives of Fatah and Hamas - had met the conditions laid down by the Quartet (EU, United States, Russia and United Nations)", in particular regarding the recognition of Israel within its 1967 borders.
MEPs are calling on the EU to halt the economic embargo which is paralysing the Palestinian territories by resuming direct payments of EU aid to the Palestinian Authority, thus ending the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) created by the EU at the request of the Quartet and approved by the European Council. This mechanism covers healthcare, utilities and social welfare.
The delegation of 12 MEPs also raised the issue of the 11,000 Palestinian prisoners, including Aziz Dweik, Speaker of the Legislative Council, and appealed for the release of the soldier Gilad Shalit and of BBC journalist Alan Johnston.
