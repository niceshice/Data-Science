The future of Serbia and Kosovo lies within the EU
Last week's visit of the European Parliament Delegation for South-East Europe to Serbia and Kosovo inspired us to interview chairwoman Doris Pack on how she sees the current situation in the region and what role the European Parliament can play in the reconciliation process.
Bearing in mind the Parliament's still limited competence in EU foreign policy what was the goal of the last delegation to Belgrade and Pristina and what did you do?
While foreign policy is an executive policy, "the executive needs the advice, proposals and opinions of elected MEPs," she said. With this mission in mind the EP Delegation came to the Western Balkans to meet with United Nations, Serbian and Kosovo authorities, as well as the representatives of minorities, NGOs and churches to get familiar with the real situation in the region. Mrs Pack sees a problem extending beyond the borders of Serbia and Kosovo and is calling for a change to the EU visa policy so that the example of Serbia where "more than 70% of young people have never been outside" their country will become history.
How can parliament help in the process of getting agreement on the future status of Kosovo and in the period following any agreement?
"We can help to make the politicians of both sides understand how to behave, to understand each other and....to try to reconcile." Mrs Pack says the EP has "an influence on these countries which can not be compared with national parliaments." She gave the example of Albania where the 2002 parliament elections were falsified. After 3 months, MEPs convinced the Albanians that they couldn't use the results. "So everybody knows that our strong, but constructive, stance with these countries, is helping them to overcome the problems they face, which have been inherited from previous regimes."
Whether Kosovo gains independence or not, what are the prospects of Serbia and Kosovo joining the EU? Is there any time horizon that officials use when this issue is being debated?
The fact is that after the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, this region will be surrounded by EU Member States and this "black hole...should be filled in our own interests, not only in the interests of these people". She said the biggest obstacle to Serbia is the deliverance of General Mladić to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. It seems that a large part of the Serbian population still does not understand what happened in the past and why he should be given up. However, "the future of the whole region, including Kosovo, lies within the EU." Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica says it could happen by 2014 which is "more realistic than other people think," said Mrs Pack.
