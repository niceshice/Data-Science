Fighting illegal logging in Congo-Brazzaville and Cameroon
External/international trade
Plenary sittings

In a bid to fight the trade in illegally harvested timber and wood products, MEPs on Tuesday approved two draft agreements designed to improve the traceability of timber from Congo-Brazzaville and Cameroon.
The aim of these "voluntary partnership agreements" is to combat bad governance and corruption as well as providing for better traceability of tropical woods and import controls.
Parliament gave its backing to the agreements in two resolutions by Yannick Jadot (Greens/EFA, FR), although it voiced reservations about their implementation and asked how they would be enforced. It also called for measures to combat large-scale deforestation and degradation of intact forests, since illegal logging is regarded as the main cause of deforestation worldwide.
Voluntary partnership agreements between the EU and wood-exporting countries are part of the EU 2003 Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT). The first FLEGT licenses issued only for timber exported to the EU are expected by 2011 (Congo-Brazzaville) and 2012 (Cameroon).
Under the Lisbon Treaty, Parliament's formal consent is required for agreements of this kind but it cannot amend the legislation. Therefore, to make sure their position regarding the implementation of the agreements is heard, MEPs adopted an accompanying resolution, over and above the legally required consent resolution, setting out their views in more detail.
