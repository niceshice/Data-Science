That was the message of a Hearing in the European Parliament on 10 February. It brought together MEPs, European and American business leaders and academics. Dutch Socialist Member Judith Merkies is preparing a report for Parliament's Industry, Research and Energy Committee.
Speaking at the Hearing Ms Merkies told those present that Europe required a change of attitude towards creativity.
One of the main planks of the European Union's "Europe2020 strategy" to create jobs is the "Innovation Union" which is a project to encourage creativity to tackle economic, environment and resource scarcity problems Europe may face.
As the Chair of the Committee, German member Herbert Reul (centre right European People's Party, EPP) put it: "For us, Innovation is a very important issue when it comes to the future and functioning of the EU."
More cooperation between science and business
Research from the European Commission says that if European governments and the European Union Institutions spend 3% of their GDP on research and development by 2020 then 3.7 million jobs could be created.
Some of the plans of the Innovation Union include making it easier for researchers to move around Europe and more access to European funds. It also envisages better cooperation between science and business and bring down any barriers that may stop entrepreneurs bring their ideas to the market place.
The lack of a close and effective connection between universities, research and market is seen as one a major bottle neck for innovation in Europe. Czech MEP Evžen Tošenovský (ECR) pointed out at the Hearing that even though a huge amount of money is invested in innovation and research programmes "commercialisation is almost a dirty word in Europe".
A University system fit for Innovation?
Dr Burton Lee, a Lecturer at Stanford School of Engineering in the United States questioned the traditional European University system: "Unless you get the University system right, the innovation system is always going to be dysfunctional" he said.
Judith Merkies agreed that academic fields in Europe may be old-fashioned and not focused on applied science, close to the market. "Most Universities in Europe cannot participate in venture capital, cannot participate in loans as they are dependent upon public money." But she added "most of all we need ambition, we want a Man on the Moon also in Europe."
The Vice President of the Industrial giant Siemens Reinhold Achatz told the Hearing that what the European Union really needed was less complexity, faster decision making processes and less fragmentation of policy and effort.
Spanish MEP Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines (EPP) thinks attitudes need to be changed as "Europe has a regulating syndrome; we legislate in a very rigid way and with lack of flexibility".
