State aid as a tool for regional development
Regional policy
2005-12-15 - 12:31
The reformed rules on state aid as a tool for regional development should be more generous to regions suffering from natural, geographic or demographic disadvantages, according to the European Parliament. MEPs also call for the ceilings for the so-called 'statistical effect' regions to remain unchanged during the next Financial Perspective (2007-2013).
A large majority within the Parliament supports the view that the " statistical effect " regions should maintain Objective 1 status and receive the same treatment with regard to state aids (Article 87 (3) a) as the Union's other poorest regions for the duration of the 2007-2013 programming period. They thus unequivocally rejected the Commission's suggestion that this should be reviewed after three years.
Commenting on the lack of precision and details in the new guidelines regarding regional policy and especially on the lack of detailed rules for the recovery of aid, MEPs stress the importance of taking into account all dimensions of cohesion. Parliament appreciates that the Commission intends to use the unemployment rate as a supportive indicator for eligible areas to be defined by Member States under the Treaty but stresses the need for indicators to be introduced which will highlight the various differences in regional development, thereby enabling the Member States to measure more accurately the areas' relative degree of prosperity and consequently their eligibility for support.
