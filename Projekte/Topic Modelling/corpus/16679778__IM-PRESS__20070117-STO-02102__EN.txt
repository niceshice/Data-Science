MEPs voting on Tuesday
Tuesday was an exceptional day for the European Parliament, gathered for its plenary session in Strasbourg. The day was devoted to the election of Parliament's new President, 14 Vice-Presidents and 6 Quaestors. The votes opened the second two-and-a-half-year part of the parliamentary term. Hans-Gert Poettering was elected the 26th president of the European Parliament.
The previous President, Spanish Socialist Josep Borrell, ended his term on Monday. On Tuesday, the sitting opened under the chairmanship of the oldest MEP, Giovanni Berlinguer, an Italian Socialist born in 1924. He announced the start of the election procedure.
Election of the President
German Christian Democrat Hans-Gert Poettering was elected in a first-round ballot after getting 450 votes of the 689 cast. In his first presidential speech he promised to work for a united Europe where all nations, small or big ones, have their say. He went on to say that "the dignity of man, respect of law, and solidarity of the European peoples will be the principles of my engagement”. He also expressed the hope that the House will "judge his work in a fair and objective way."
Three other candidates stood for the post:
Jens-Peter Bonde, Danish, from the Independence and Democracy Group: 46 votes Francis Wurtz, French, European United Left / Nordic Green Left: 48 votes Monica Frassoni, Italian, for the Greens /European Free Alliance: 145 votes
Election of the Vice-Presidents
One of the President's first tasks was to preside over the election of the 14 Vice Presidents. As there were 14 candidates their election was a formality - however a secret ballot still took place to determine their order of precedence.
This is the order of precedence of the 14 elected Vice-Presidents: 703 votes were cast of which 696 were valid and 7 were blank / spoiled:
1) Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (EPP-ED, GR): 322
2) Alejo Vidal-Quadras (EPP-ED, ES): 300
3) Gérard Onesta (Greens/EFA, FR): 285
4) Edward Mcmillan-Scott (EPP-ED, UK): 274
5) Mario Mauro (EPP-ED, IT): 262
6) Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez (PSE, ES): 260
7) Luigi Cocilovo (ALDE, IT): 234
8) Mechtild Rothe (PES, DE): 217
9) Luisa Morgantini (GUE/NGL, IT): 207
10) Pierre Moscovici (PES, FR): 207
11) Manuel António dos Santos (PES, PT): 193
12) Diana Wallis (ALDE, UK): 192
13) Marek Siwiec (PES, PL): 180
14) Adam Bielan (UEN, PL): 128
