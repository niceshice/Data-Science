Follow-up to the Sakharov Prize - MEPs deplore that prize-winners prevented from receiving award in person

In adopting a joint resolution, Parliament deplores the fact that some prize-winners have still not been authorised to receive their prize in person, which represents a violation of one of the fundamental rights of each human being (namely the freedom to enter and leave one’s own country without hindrance – a right which is specifically recognised by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights).
The 1990 prize winner (the Burmese dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest) and the 2005 prize winner (the Cuban collective Damas de Blanco) have not yet been authorised to come to receive the prize.
The Conference of Presidents decided to dispatch two delegations to Cuba and Burma to establish contact with the prize winners in order to check on their personal situation. The winner of the 1996 Sakharov Prize - Wei Jinsheng, who was still imprisoned at the time - has not yet had the opportunity to address the Plenary and receive the reward linked to the prize.
The House demands that, following the Conference of Presidents' decision to dispatch two delegations (one to Burma and the other to Cuba), the authorities of those countries facilitate the delegations' journeys. Parliament welcomes the decision taken by the Conference of Presidents on 16 November to establish a follow-up mechanism for winners of the Sakharov Prize and systematically to dispatch a European Parliament delegation to meet those prize winners who have not been authorised by the authorities of their countries to attend the prize-giving ceremony. The House reiterates its demand that all winners of the Sakharov Prize (and in particular Aung San Suu Kyi, Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas and the Cuban collective Damas de Blanco) be given access to the European institutions. The House calls upon its President to take all the necessary steps in order to enable these decisions to be implemented.
Finally, Parliament calls upon the Conference of Presidents to enter on the agenda for its next meeting the organisation of a ceremony to award the Sakharov Prize to Wei Jinsheng.
