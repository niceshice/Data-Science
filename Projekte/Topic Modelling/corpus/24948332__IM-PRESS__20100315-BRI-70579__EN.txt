Budget
2011 budget: Parliament to spell out its priorities
2010-03-22 - 17:34
Young people, economic recovery and research should be the top priorities for next year's EU budget, says a draft resolution from the EP Budgets Committee which will be put to the vote on Thursday. It also seeks to step up pressure on the other EU institutions, firstly to give Parliament more say in the set-up of the European External Action Service and secondly to launch the long-awaited review of the EU's multiannual budget. Regarding youth policy, the Budgets Committee wants to promote language study, entrepreneurship and youth mobility. To help economic recovery, it wants the EU to provide more funding for research and innovative, especially green, technologies as well more pilot projects for small and medium-sized firms in rural areas.
The 2011 budget procedure is the first where Parliament will decide jointly with the Council on the whole budget, including agriculture. By stating its priorities in advance, the EP expects to influence the Commission's compilation of the draft budget - the first formal step in the annual budgetary procedure - which is to be presented at the end of April.
MEPs also plan to use the budget procedure as a means of exercising their general right of parliamentary scrutiny over the new European External Action Service (EEAS). The draft resolution states "to increase the EP’s involvement in the shaping and management of the EU’s external relations, it will fully exercise its scrutiny over the budget and budgetary control of EEAS".
Long-term budget review
MEPs are also expected to ask the Commission to launch the mid-term review of EU's long-term budget (for the years 2007-2013) before the summer. Such a review is "an absolute necessity", says the draft resolution, since the current budget framework has not allowed the EU to "react properly and satisfactorily to various challenges that have arisen in recent years". Parliament has been pressing for this review for some time.
The Budgets Committee's report on the main part of the EU budget (which is managed by the Commission) was drafted by Sidonia Elżbieta JĘDRZEJEWSKA (EPP, PL). Helga TRÜPEL (Greens/EFA, DE) is responsible for steering through Parliament the administrative budgets of other EU institutions. Procedure: budgetary

Eurozone and economic governance: debate with ECB president Trichet
2010-03-22 - 17:34
Economic governance and monetary policy will take centre stage on Thursday as MEPs hold their annual debate on the euro area with ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet. Parliament will then vote on three resolutions: on the euro area and public finances, the work of the ECB in 2008 and the appointment of the new ECB vice-president. The ECB's activity report for 2008 sets out to explain the Bank's decisions and strategies. Following Mr Trichet's presentation and a debate, MEPs will vote on a draft resolution by Edward SCICLUNA (S&D, MT) which focuses on the ECB's role in the recent financial crisis, asking whether the Bank made sufficiently aggressive interest rate cuts and arguing that the extra liquidity injected may not have gone to the right destination. With regard to the post-crisis phase, the draft resolution "recommends that any moves to increase interest rates should be made with the utmost caution so as not to endanger future economic growth". It also calls for more help for non-euro Member States.
The draft resolution on the euro area and public finances, by Sven GIEGOLD (Greens/EFA, DE), calls for a revamp of the EMU framework and economic governance within the eurozone, particularly through binding commitments between the Member States. It also suggests that reducing deficits and debt are only part of the solution to the current economic imbalances and calls for better scrutiny of statistics of aspiring eurozone countries. The resolution warns against constraining wages too much in order to reduce deficits, since lower salaries will slow down economic growth.
Finally, MEPs will vote on a draft resolution by Sharon BOWLES (ALDE, UK), on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, regarding the appointment by the Council of Vitor Constâncio as ECB vice-president. Procedure: own-initiative

Food quality: legislation needed
2010-03-22 - 17:34
The compulsory labelling of farm produce gives consumers valuable information about food quality and can boost farmers' competitiveness, says a draft resolution by the EP Agriculture Committee on which the full Parliament will vote on Thursday. Protecting EU geographical indications and traditional specialities from counterfeiting also helps safeguard food quality, argues the committee, which believes legislation is needed in this area. Plans for an EU food quality policy, intended to add value to the economies of Europe's regions, are set out in a draft resolution by Giancarlo SCOTTÀ (EFD, IT). The resolution is a response to a Commission consultation paper on EU food quality policy and forms part of a wider debate within Parliament on the future aims of the Common Agricultural Policy. The resolution argues that, far from being a burden, quality standards can create "important business advantages for European producers" and make "an indirect contribution to rural development".
Keeping the current system of geographical indications (GIs), setting up a binding register of all GI products at the WTO and introducing "place of farming" labelling for "primary products" (such as vegetables and flowers) are among other proposals by the Agriculture Committee.
Wonky fruit and veg: yes or no?
The Agriculture Committee approved an amendment to the draft resolution, calling for a debate on the reintroduction of marketing standards on the size, shape and colour of fruit and vegetables. It says such standards would provide "a common language for operators, as well as consumer-friendly quality criteria".
These rules were introduced in 1988 to raise standards, reduce costs and facilitate trade but then scrapped in 2009 on the basis that this would cut red tape, increase consumer choice and reduce waste. Procedure: own-initiative

Rescuing migrants at sea: are "guidelines" enough?
2010-03-22 - 17:34
MEPs could veto a proposed set of guidelines on the EU FRONTEX border agency's surveillance of external sea borders. This will happen if the full Parliament backs the view of the EP Civil Liberties Committee, which rejected the proposal last Wednesday on the grounds that although the guidelines are right to affirm the duty to search for and rescue migrants at sea, this duty should be enshrined in law, not mere guidelines. .

Tibet two years after the violence in Lhasa
2010-03-22 - 17:34
MEPs will discuss the current situation in Tibet with the Commission in a debate on Wednesday. In a resolution adopted in April 2008, Parliament "firmly condemned the brutal repression by the Chinese security forces" during the violent events which took place in Tibet a month earlier. It called for "the immediate release of all those who protested peacefully, exercising their legitimate right to freedom of expression". It also demanded "an open and independent inquiry into the riots and repression in Tibet under the auspices of the UN". Commission statements (no resolution)

Transaction tax and debt moratorium to help developing countries
2010-03-22 - 17:34
The world's richer nations should set up a financial transaction tax at global level to create a fairer financial system and to generate more resources for funding development, says a draft resolution by the Development Committee to be put to the vote on Thursday. A temporary debt moratorium should also be set up to help developing countries cope with the effects of the global crisis and there should be an independent body to deal with debt arbitration, says the resolution. It adds that the richer countries should stick to their commitments for reaching the Millennium Development Goals and that EU Member States should earmark at least 25% of the EU's CO2 emission trading revenue to help developing countries deal with climate change.

Ahead of the second European Roma summit taking place in Cordoba on 8 April, MEPs will vote on a resolution on the role of the EU in the integration of the Roma into wider society. The ten million Roma form the biggest ethnic minority in Europe but often face discrimination and social exclusion. This vote is a follow-up to oral questions on this subject that were debated at Parliament's last plenary session and called for better use to be made of EU financing intended to promote the socio-economic inclusion of the Roma, the funds having had only limited impact so far.

Budget
EU aid to unemployed in Lithuania
2010-03-22 - 17:34
Around 1,100 former furniture and textile workers in Lithuania are poised to receive EU aid worth €1.2 million to fund measures such as training, job-search assistance and business start-ups. If the full Parliament this week endorses the recommendation of its Budgets Committee, a total of 1,127 workers will get aid worth €1.8 million, of which the European Globalisation Fund will pay €1.2 million. Of the 1,127 workers, 491 used to work at 45 companies in the clothing sector and 636 were employed by 49 furniture manufacturing firms. The Council of Ministers gave its approval for the funding on Monday 22 March.
The support measures include information on employment opportunities, the development of personalised employment plans, job-search assistance and entrepreneurship and other training.
Three applications to the European Globalisation Adjustment fund have already been approved so far in 2010: one from Germany (former employees at the Karmann industry) and two from Lithuania (for construction workers and for ex-employees at the refrigerator producer Snaige). If these two new proposals are adopted, a total of €8,761,966 will have been paid out under the Globalisation Fund, leaving just over €491m available for the rest of 2010 from the Fund's total allocation of €500m.

Fighting tuberculosis
2010-03-22 - 17:34
Parliament will mark World Tuberculosis Day on Wednesday by discussing with the European Commission the measures being taken to fight this disease, which causes around 1.7 million deaths a year. The EU has funded research into tuberculosis under its research framework programmes and in 2008 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued a framework action plan to fight tuberculosis in the EU. The incidence of tuberculosis varies greatly in the EU, from 4.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Cyprus to 126.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Romania, in 2006. Commission statement

EP sets out recommendations to UN General Assembly
2010-03-22 - 17:34
MEPs have identified six key topics that they believe should be tackled at the 65th session of the UN General Assembly which begins in September this year: the EU at the United Nations, global governance and UN reform, peace and security, development, human rights and climate change. MEPs demands are set out in a draft resolution by Alexander Graf Lambsdorff (ALDE, DE), which says the new High Representative should coordinate the positions of the Member States better with a view to reform of the Security Council, and a seat for the EU in an enlarged Security Council must remain a goal of the European Union. Vote: 25.03.2010 Recommendation to the Council on the 65th Session of the United Nations General Assembly Profile of rapporteur Alexander Graf LAMBSDORFF (ALDE, DE)
