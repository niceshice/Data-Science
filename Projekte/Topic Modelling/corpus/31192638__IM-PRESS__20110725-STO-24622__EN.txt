Utoya island, Norway 76 people were killed in the attacks on government buildings and the Labour Party youth camp in Norway. EP President Jerzy Buzek condemned the attacks, calling them a tragedy for Norway and the whole world. "I condemn with the strongest possible means these cowardly attacks on these innocent young people", said Buzek.
76 were killed and 96 were injured in the twin attacks against government quarters in Oslo and Labour Party youth camp on island Utoya on Friday 22 July 2011.
The police arrested the suspect, a 32 year old Norwegian, at the scene of the Utoya massacre. He is also believed to be behind the bombing of the government buildings. He later confessed to both.
EP president Jerzy Buzek issued two statements condemning the attacks.
"This is an unimaginable tragedy for the families who lost their loved ones, young people at the outset of their adult life, fascinated with public service", said Buzek in a statement on the Utoya massacre. "It is a terrible tragedy for all of Norway and the world. It is shocking how one can inflict so much evil."
"I sincerely hope that all the perpetrators are caught and brought to justice".
In Norway, a moment of silence was held in honour of the victims at 1200 on Monday 25 July. Governments in neighbouring Scandinavian countries encouraged their citizens to join in.
"On behalf of the European Parliament I would like to convey my solidarity and sympathy to the families, the authorities and all Norwegians. We are with you in this tragic hour", Buzek said in his Utoya statement.
