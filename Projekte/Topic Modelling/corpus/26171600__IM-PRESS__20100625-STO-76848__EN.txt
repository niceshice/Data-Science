Euro MPs strongly backed the measure when it came before them in April last year. It means a maximum tariff of €0.39 per minute and €0.15 per minute per calls received. The cuts introduced by the European Union apply to all operators in all 27 countries in the Union.
In addition:
There is a €50 euro cut off limit per month to protect people from shocks at high bills they may have got through surfing the internet on their laptops whilst in another country.
Operators are obliged to send users a warning when they reach 80% of their data-roaming bill limit.
The maximum wholesale prices for data roaming will fall from 1 to €0.80 per megabyte.
Receiving a voice mail message while roaming will become free .
