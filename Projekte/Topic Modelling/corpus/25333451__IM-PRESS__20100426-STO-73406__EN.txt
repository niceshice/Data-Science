Mr Salafranca EU-Latin America Summit 18 May Hope that Summit leads to new trade agreements Ahead of the EU-Latin America summit in Madrid on 18 May MEPs discussed new priorities between the two regions during last week's plenary. The EU is currently the main donor of development aid and the main investor in the region but is losing its position in "the other America" warns rapporteur, Spanish EPP member José Ingnacio Salafranca, who urges remedial action.
What are the new priorities and what do you expect from the Madrid Summit?
We have to move from a bi-regional agenda to a global agenda during the Madrid Summit. The EU and Latin America are partners who have to face the challenges of today's global agenda together: from the digital economy, globalisation, the economic and financial crisis, security threats, the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and organised crime to the preservation of the environment and natural resources, the fight against poverty and inequality and migration.
I think it is important that we keep in mind that the EU is losing its position on the subcontinent. We hope that the Madrid Summit will conclude an EU-Central America Association Agreement and multi-party trade agreements with Colombia and Peru, as well as relaunching negotiations with Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay).
Why the interest in Latin America?
There are few parts of the world that have such a high affinity in values and interests as those that link the EU with Latin America. We share values like pluralistic and representative democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression, the rule of law, respect for the rules of the game and the rejection of all forms of dictatorship and authoritarian rule. We have a common history that gives us a very similar vision of the world.
The EU, Latin America and the Caribbean bring together more than a billion people, and account for a third of the UN member states and more than 25% of global GDP.
Speaking about common values, the human rights situation in some Latin American countries like Colombia is still critical…
The human rights situation in Colombia can obviously be improved, but we have been following its evolution for a long time and I can assure you that the outgoing administration of the President Uribe has made a really great effort. The situation has improved substantially over previous years. It has to keep improving each day and we expect that the new agreement between Peru and Colombia will help Colombian society, a society that really cries out for peace.
What is the best remedy against poverty in the region?
There are two. Firstly, education. The grey matter is the raw material. Nowadays, it is almost more important for a country to provide schooling to all its children than to have oil wells. Although, obviously, it always helps to have natural resources - look at Russia. And, secondly, they have to try to overcome disparities in the region. We, in the EU, have the solidarity funds, but this does not exist in Latin America. The EU also promotes integration projects. Today, the old Roman motto "Union is strength" is more true than ever.
What about the fight against drugs? Can it be efficient if some of the leaders of the subcontinent say that coca is an intrinsic part of their culture?
We have to find a solution. Some are producer countries and others are consumer countries. We have to work together to find imaginative solutions such as alternative crops.
