A major part of the programme will be dedicated to discussing the legislative package on economic governance proposed by the Commission, which is currently before Parliament.
The workshop will provide an opportunity to question Members of Parliament on their views on the issue and on the various options available. It should also be an occasion to discuss with Members whether the proposals are sufficient to avoid future crisis of the system, the usefulness of automatic sanctions, or whether measures to enhance competitiveness, such as ending the indexation of salaries, should become a part of the Community system.
The seminar takes place a couple of days before the Spring European Council, which is expected to concentrate on economic and competitiveness affairs. The parliamentary committee will be assessing possible amendments to the package on the day before the workshop.
The economic governance package is made up of six draft laws: four on fiscal issues, including a wide-ranging reform of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), and two aimed at detecting and addressing effectively any emerging macroeconomic imbalances within the EU and the euro area. 09:00 13:30 Brussels, Paul-Henri Spaak building - room 7C050 Draft programme on the economic governance workshop John SCHRANZ Press officer policy area ECON Press Unit BXL (+32) 2 28 44264 PORT (+32) 498 98 14 02 EMAIL econ-press@europarl.europa.eu 2011-03-24 Plenary session Plenary agenda
