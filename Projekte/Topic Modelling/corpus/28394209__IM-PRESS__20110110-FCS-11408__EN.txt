Hungary presidency steps in, Belgium bows out Clearer rules on patients’ rights to cross border healthcare Vote on EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement Debate on freedom of religion Hungary presidency steps in, Belgium bows out. Prime Minster Viktor Orbán presents the priorities of Hungary's incoming Council presidency on Wednesday, after Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme has reviewed his country's recent stint at the helm of the EU on Tuesday. Also on Wednesday, European Council President Van Rompuy reports on the EU's December summit.
Clearer rules on patients’ rights to cross border healthcare within the EU are one step closer, following a provisional deal reached between MEPs and Council just before Christmas. On Wednesday, MEPs will vote on the draft legislation, which covers key points, such as authorisation and reimbursement.
Sanctions on Belarus? MEPs will discuss December's rigged elections in Belarus, following which opposition leaders were jailed and demonstrators attacked by police. They will then vote on what sanctions the EU should impose on Belarus President Lukashenko and other government figures. Visa bans and a freeze on assets are high on the list of options.
On Tuesday MEPs will debate and are expected to approve the EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement , which needs Parliament's consent as well as Member States' ratification to enter into force.
Saving children through adoption within the EU. Abandoned children can be saved from a life in orphanages if more is done to defend the right of would-be parents to adopt a child from an EU country other than their own, argue MEPs from several political groups in an oral question to the Commission. They also stress the need to safeguard the rights of the adopted children.
MEPs will quiz the Commission on the action it plans to take over a Lithuanian draft law which they say "would seriously limit freedom of speech and expression, such as publicly supporting or campaigning for equality or LGBT rights or against discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation" in the country.
Haiti: one year after the earthquake. On Tuesday evening MEPs will take stock of the EU's reconstruction aid throughout 2010 for Haiti, a country hit by severe problems over and above the consequences of the earthquake of 12 January 2010. These include hurricane Tomas, the cholera epidemic, tension surrounding the presidential elections and fragile state institutions.
MEPs will discuss the widespread rioting in Tunisia , including the violent clashes with the police in the past few days that have left several demonstrators dead.
Freedom of religion: a basic human right. Following recent violence against Christians in Egypt, Iraq and Nigeria, MEPs will hold a debate on Wednesday on freedom of religion, followed by the adoption of a resolution on Thursday.

Monday debate: Safer & greener homes and construction materials
Stacked corrugated cement fiber (asbestos) Amiante ©BELGA_ Review of rules governing the market for construction materials MEPs to debate changes Monday evening Our homes are the places where we spend most of our free time. They are places where we eat, sleep and spend time with our loved ones. So it is of paramount importance that our homes are safe: the roofs should not be falling on our heads for any reason at all and materials used in buildings should be free from hazardous substances. In their review of rules governing the market for construction materials, MEPs aim to ensure this will indeed be the case and will debate the issue Monday evening.
MEPs agree deal with European governments
On 10 January the Parliament's Internal Market Committee endorsed an agreement reached with European governments in December on a new EU regulation on the marketing of construction products. This will be debated by the full European Parliament on Monday 17 January, and put to a vote on 18 January.
The rules deal with standards that construction products have to fulfill ("CE" marking that allows the manufacturers to market their products across EU), information that has to be provided and environment issues such as recycling, health and safety issues.
In the Committee stage MEPs have demanded that construction works be designed in such a way as to allow their re-use or recyclability.
Serious and fatal accidents a fact of life for construction workers
In Germany, the EU's biggest economy, 1 construction worker in 5,000 suffers a fatal accident during their working life time. MEPs therefore demanded that construction materials don't give off toxic gases, are relatively fire-safe, durable and don't present risks such as falling and electrocution.
The British MEP who has guided the measures through the Parliament is Catherine Stihler (S&D). Ahead of the debate she said that. "labels on construction products will in the future have to declare what hazardous substances are in the product, which can prevent illnesses such as mesothelioma" (a rare form of cancer caused by asbestos).
Getting a "CE" marking is a relatively burdensome process, especially for smaller manufacturers. Ms Stihler told us that "there are also simplified procedures in place for small and medium size enterprises to place their products on the market which provides an easier and cheaper route to the market than larger companies." There are around 65,000 small companies in the European Union that are involved in manufacturing construction materials.

Farmers & food price rises debated by MEPs Monday
The harvest at a crop field in Kembs, France. Prices of essentials like wheat have risen sharply in the last few weeks. ©BELGA Report on farm policy debated and put to vote this week Agriculture MEPs concerned about rising food prices on international markets Role of food speculators under fire Ageing of Europe's farmers causing concern as 4.5 million head for retirement in next decade While the number of people to feed in the world is growing, food prices have probably never been so unstable. It's estimated that up to 50% of the recent hikes in farm prices were caused by speculative behaviour in the markets. In a report to be debated Monday evening, MEPs will discuss possible solutions as well as the problem posed by ageing farmers in Europe and the need for a targeted global food stock system.
Romanian Socialist Daciana Octavia Sârbu, who drafted the report, believes it is essential "to maintain a strong CAP (EU Common Agricultural Policy) in order to ensure food security".
Need to tackle speculation in food markets
Food markets are currently very unstable. For example the price of contracts for wheat recently rose 70% in two months, and speculation is clearly a crucial problem. "We need to tackle the problems caused by financial speculation; this would likely involve regulation to restrict speculation and to avoid the kind of price hikes we have seen in the recent past," Ms Sârbu said.
The Sârbu report supports a revision of existing legislation on financial instruments, which would provide for more transparent trading. "We call on the European Commission (which administers the CAP) to introduce permanent and robust measures to address volatility in agricultural markets as a matter of urgency," she said.
Instability on the markets is also seen as a significant problem by Swedish Liberal vice-chair of Parliament's Agriculture Committee Marit Paulsen. "I would like the suggested safety nets against extreme price volatility to be more market-based."
4.5 million farmers to reach retirement within decade
Another significant challenge for European agriculture is aging farmers, as few young people are coming into the industry to replace them. The report notes that only 7% of European farmers are below 35, while at least 4.5 million will retire in the next 10 years.
MEPs on the Agriculture Committee have therefore suggested strengthening measures (such as financial inducements) that could encourage young people to enter farming.
Global issues for CAP
The Sârbu report also points out that food security is a global problem. According to the Romanian MEP, "we are proposing a global system of food stocks - for use in emergencies and to help regulate commodity prices. This would ease the pressure on world food markets and help ward off recurring protectionism".
Ms Paulsen agrees that food security is a crucial challenge for the future CAP. "The main question is how we can increase food production by 40%, in order to feed 9 billion, while using less land, less water and less chemicals in the future."
The report partially follows up Parliament's resolution on the CAP reform beyond 2013, adopted in July 2010, where Parliament urged the need for more balanced and fair distribution of support to farmers.
MEPs will vote on the report on Wednesday.

New EU-Africa timber partnerships could herald more forestry protection
First in series of agreements between Europe and Africa over timber Emphasise participation, transparency, corruption Part of EU Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) The extensive timber export industry from the Republic of Congo and Cameroon to Europe could take a step towards a more sustainable footing this week as one of the first in a series of Voluntary Partnerships Agreements with African States are considered by MEPs Monday (17 January).
They form part of the EU Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT).
Abundant timber - for now
Both Cameroon and the Republic of Congo (not to be confused with its larger neighbour the Democratic Republic of Congo) are important players in the timber market. Cameroon, 40% of which is covered by forests, is the largest exporter of hardwood to Europe. In Congo it is estimated that 20% of its timber exported to Europe is illegal.
Both countries face serious problems regarding the governance of the trade, environmental degradation and corruption. These partnerships (as part of FLEGT) will allow much greater monitoring by the European Union of where the timber comes from and allowing legal management of the resources.
French Green MEP Yannick Jadot from the Parliament's Committee on International Trade has drafted reports on both the partnerships agreements.
The reports will be debated Monday - along with a question to the European Commission on the workings of FLEGT from a majority of the political groups in the Parliament.
Participation, transparency, corruption
In particular the Jadot reports pick out three aspects of the partnerships agreements as crucial to success:
Participation: Local people on the ground must be involved in drafting the rules and in the early stages of implementation the agreements.
Transparency: The names of companies and its shareholders must be made public as well as those of European operators.
Corruption: The Jadot reports emphasise the important of the independence of the local legal system in each country and recommends the creation of an Ombudsman post for each Voluntary Partnerships Agreement. This would allow civil society to appeal if they felt the agreement was being violated.
The European Parliament will this week be asked to vote to approve the partnership agreements. After the Lisbon Treaty the European Parliament has more powers relating to trade agreements negotiated by the European Commission and agreed by EU governments.

Opening of session: Auschwitz and Lithuanian anniversaries, Belarus and Tunisia
Flag day, European Parliament, Strasbourg, eastern France, 17 January 2011 Buzek draws attention to upcoming 66th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz Highlights fate of Chinese lawyer Gao Zhisheng The 66th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the 20th anniversary of Lithuania's Bloody Sunday, the UN Convention on people with disabilities and the disappearance of Chinese lawyer Gao Zhisheng were among matters highlighted by President Jerzy Buzek at the opening of this week's European Parliament session in Strasbourg. Mr Buzek also spoke of the current situation in Belarus and made the opening statement in a debate on Tunisia.
First, Mr Buzek drew attention to two important dates: the 66th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration and extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau will be commemorated on 27 January , while the 20th anniversary of Lithuania's Bloody Sunday, on which 14 people were killed during Lithuania's struggle for independence from the Soviet Union, took place on 13 January.
The EP president then welcomed the EU's accession to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. He also voiced Parliament's concern at the fate of Chinese opposition activist Gao Zhisheng, who has disappeared after being tortured, and called on the Chinese government to reveal Mr Gao's whereabouts and his state of health.
The president thanked the outgoing Belgian presidency of the EU and welcomed its Hungarian successor. He then referred to the recent elections in Belarus, which will be debated by MEPs on Wednesday. In addition, he expressed Parliament's sympathy for the victims of a number of recent natural disasters around the world.
Tunisia: Buzek calls for independent inquiry and offers aid for free monitored elections
Introducing a debate on the ongoing turmoil in Tunisia, Mr Buzek said "The European Parliament applauds the courage of the Tunisian people and the Jasmine Revolution in the country". "The EP is willing to assist the new interim authorities in the organisation of free, pluralistic and internationally monitored elections", he added.
President Buzek described the current events as a "historic moment". On behalf of the European Parliament, he listed four key demands to the new Tunisian authorities:
the immediate release of all those arrested;
the launching of independent inquiries into corruption and use of violence;
the holding of free, pluralistic and internationally monitored elections, a process which Parliament is ready to accompany and assist;
in the run-up to elections, the establishment of a government of national unity including all democratic forces.
A request by the Green/EFA group for a resolution on the situation in Tunisia to be added to this week's agenda was rejected by the House, as was a proposal by the GUE/NGL group to remove Thursday's debate and resolution on the case of Cesare Battisti in Brazil.

Alzheimer's: will it become a health priority for Europe?
Tuesday afternoon: debate on a report calling for changes to way Dementia's are dealth with Report calls for specialist centres, more public awareness and sharing of best practice in treatment Every year 1.4 million Europeans develop some type of dementia. It is estimated that 35.6 million people worldwide suffered from dementia in all its forms in 2010. A report being debated Tuesday afternoon (18 January at 1600 CET) calls for more sharing of scientific knowledge, raising public awareness to recognise early symptoms and setting up specialist centres.
The number of sufferers of some form of dementia could nearly double every 20 years, possibly reaching 65.7 million in 2030.
The report by Portuguese MEP Marisa Matias (GUE/NGL) calls on European governments to make combating and treating Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias a priority. The report has already been backed by the Parliament's cross party Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
In particular the report calls for:
More cooperation between countries in research, care and prevention of Alzheimer's.
The launch of a European Year of Mental Health, complementing World Alzheimer’s Day on 21 September.
Efforts to raise public awareness about dementia in the EU, facilitating recognition of the early symptoms of dementia, setting up measures to strengthen research, improving access to diagnosis and drugs.
The setting up of specialist centres and the provision of satisfactory medical equipment and improvements to the skills of professional carers.
The development of action plans aimed at improving the well-being and quality of life of patients suffering from dementia and their families.
As the population ages dementia will increase
With the world population becoming older, diseases like Alzheimer's are a big challenge including from a financial point of view. Almost one in 20 people over the age of 65 and one in five over 80 suffers from dementia.
The symptoms of Alzheimer's are often confused with common signs of ageing and the number of people who have the disease without knowing it remains high. Today the total direct medical and social care costs of Alzheimer’s disease in Europe amount to over €100 billion.
"The increasingly ageing population and the mounting pressure on public finances and private productivity due to increased expenses for this ageing population will create a structural problem for Member States," the report says.
"Dementia is therefore expected to be one of the main challenges for the sustainability of national social and healthcare systems, including informal care and long-term care facilities, in the coming decades," it adds.

Serbia debate
A government official arranges flags prior to a press conference in Belgrade. ©BELGA MEPs were on Tuesday morning set to debate a crucial "Stablisation and Association Agreement" between the EU and Serbia. The deal could prove an important landmark on Belgrade's road to EU membership.
Although Serbia has made progress in its membership aspirations, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia over the fate of the fugitive Ratko Mladic remains an outstanding obstacle.
Belgian Presidency judged a European success story
Belgium's Prime Minister Yves Leterme, European Parliament, Strasbourg, eastern France, 18 January The Belgian Presidency of the Council of the EU is a role model for future holders of the post because Belgium focused on moving Europe forward and didn't try and push national priorities, most of Parliament's political groups said during a debate Tuesday morning.
MEPs agreed that Belgium's six months at the helm of the Council of the EU, the first presidency under the new Lisbon Treaty framework, were very successful. It won plaudits for following the agenda of the European Commission and Parliament and for working with Commission, Council and the EP in developing a working method under the new rules. There were some suggestions that the fact that Belgian still has a caretaker government allowed it to focus clearly on Europe.
Acting Prime Minister Yves Leterme said Belgium had worked to encourage cooperation and inclusion and had been successful in getting agreements on financial supervision and the budget but warned that the EU must go much further. "Monetary union is not possible without economic union and more convergence, strong supervision and budgetary discipline."
Other priorities for the future include increasing the EU's role in the world and working with the EP on how the EU will be funded in the future, he said. He finished by telling MEPs that "Europe needs a soul" and will only be able to move forward "if we believe in ourselves."

Haiti: fragility of the state and political crisis worry MEPs
Port Au Prince, Haiti, one year on. People pray at the Cathedral and hold a candle-light vigil for those lost in the quake. ©BELGA One year after the earthquake, Haiti is still in chaos MEPs are deeply concerned about the current political crisis One year after the earthquake, Haiti is still in chaos, an emergency situation where rebuilding has barely begun, say MEPs in a resolution adopted on Wednesday. They recognise the considerable efforts of NGOs on the ground but emphasise the weak capacity of the Haitian state and the risk that the political crisis could deteriorate.
Commending the work of humanitarian organisations active in Haiti, MEPs say better communication is needed about the non-visible effects of the humanitarian measures because it is thanks to these that the situation on the ground has been brought under control.
The recent cholera epidemic has highlighted the almost total inability of the Haitian state to cope with a disease which is easy to prevent and cure, and the limits of international aid in a country receiving massive humanitarian resources (12,000 NGO staff). Humanitarian actors "should not and cannot continue to overcome the weaknesses of the Haitian state or even replace it", according to the resolution. It urges the state to respect its commitments, strengthen its authority and build up the capacity of local and national institutions.
Reconstruction needs stability and political will
Following the results of the contested presidential and legislative elections in November 2010, MEPs are deeply concerned about the current political crisis.
The EU, they say, should do everything in its power to support a transparent and legitimate electoral process and the smooth running of the postponed second round in February, to prevent Haiti falling into a deeper crisis. "Only an elected and legitimate president and parliamentarians can take legitimate decisions and the necessary reconstruction requires stability and political will", stress MEPs.

MEPs urge Lithuanian parliament to reject anti-gay law
People hold a giant flag as they took part in the ''Baltic Pride 2010'' march, the country's first gay pride event, on May 8, 2010, in Vilnius. ©BELGA The European Parliament called on the Lithuanian parliament on Wednesday to reject a draft law that would punish the "public promotion of homosexual relations". It added that minors should be able to access information about homosexuality freely and asked the European Commission to present a plan to combat homophobia.
Wednesday's resolution, put forward by the S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA and GUE/GNL groups, was triggered by "a series of worrying events", according to MEPs. These include the adoption of a Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information, an attempted ban by local authorities on holding equality and gay pride marches and the use by leading politicians of inflammatory or threatening language and hate speech.
The immediate issue is a draft law that would amend the Code of Administrative Offences to punish the "public promotion of homosexual relations" with a fine of between €580 and €2900. This could potentially criminalise almost any public expression or portrayal of, or information about, homosexuality, according to a report by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency presented to MEPs on 30 November.
The draft law is contrary to the Lithuanian Constitution, believes the EP, an opinion shared by the Lithuanian Justice Minister. Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaitė (a former EU Commissioner) has also taken a firm stand on the legislation, denouncing it as harmful for Lithuanian citizens and the image of the country.
The proposed amendments "have not yet been voted by the plenary of the Lithuanian parliament and are still under review by the Lithuanian national authorities", MEPs point out. They welcome the authorities plan to review the proposed amendments that have been deemed to be in conflict with European law and ask President Grybauskaitė to veto them should they be approved.
EU plan to fight homophobia needed
Parliament also wants the Commission to undertake a legal assessment of the proposed amendments and to issue an EU Roadmap with measures to fight homophobia and discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.
"EU Institutions and Member States have a duty to ensure that human rights are respected, protected and promoted in the European Union", without distinction on grounds of sexual orientation, emphasise MEPs.
Education about sexual diversity can encourage tolerance
The Lithuanian parliament (Seimas) has already voted, in June 2009, to amend the Law on the Protection of Minors against Detrimental Effects of Public Information, so as to ban minors from accessing information about homosexuality.
But MEPs argue that "no credible research indicates that educating children and young people about sexuality may affect their sexual orientation (...) Education about sexual diversity encourages tolerance and acceptance of differences".

A step forward for Serbia's relations with the EU
Parliament approved on Wednesday the EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement Opens up trade between the EU and Serbia and holds out the prospect of EU membership, Parliament approved on Wednesday the EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which needed the EP's consent as well as ratification by all Member States to enter into force. While welcoming Serbia's reforms, MEPs stress that full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) remains "a fundamental condition for Serbia to progress on the path to EU membership".
“By ratifying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the European Parliament will strongly encourage Serbia to make further steps on her historic journey towards the EU. We acknowledge and welcome Serbia's achievements in the past year. At the same time, we point out all the challenges that lie ahead. Belgrade needs to cooperate fully with the ICTY in order to make sure the process of ratifying SAA will continue smoothly", said MEP Jelko Kacin (ALDE, SL), Parliament's standing rapporteur on Serbia during the plenary debate on Tuesday 18 January.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), which opens up trade between the EU and Serbia and holds out the prospect of EU membership, was signed in 2008. The EU's Member States only started the ratification process in June 2010. So far eleven States have completed ratification. MEPs call on the remaining ones to do so swiftly.
Dialogue with Kosovo: commitment and readiness to compromise
Urging that talks with Kosovo start "without delay", MEPs welcome Serbia's willingness to engage in dialogue within the EU framework, underlining that the commitment and readiness of both sides to compromise is needed for long-term stability and for improving people's wellbeing. Serbian parallel structures in northern Kosovo should be dismantled since they undermine the decentralisation process and prevent the full integration of the Serbian community into Kosovo's institutions.
No abuse of visa liberalisation
Since December 2009, Serbian nationals have been able to travel visa-free in the Schengen area and EU citizens can travel to Serbia with an ID card. The Serbian authorities should "adopt adequate measure and make full efforts in order to limit possibilities to abuse the visa free regime, in particular to ensure that Serbian citizens are properly informed about their rights and obligations stemming from the this regime", say MEPs, given the growing number of bogus asylum seekers from this country in several Member States.
Internally displaced persons and refugees
Serbia is the country with the highest number of refugees and internally displaced people in Europe, who face housing problems and poverty. More progress must be made find a durable solution to refugee problems throughout the region, say MEPs. Furthermore, as a result of readmission agreements with EU countries, up to 150,000 returnees are expected and their "successful reintegration will require thorough preparations, particularly on the level of local authorities", adds the resolution.
The resolution giving Parliament's consent was adopted by show of hands, while the resolution on Serbia's integration process was adopted by 612 votes to 38 with 28 abstentions.

Clearer rules on seeking healthcare abroad
French MEP Françoise Grossetête, (EPP) MEPs approved a new EU law setting out patients' rights EU citizens can be reimbursed for healthcare they receive in another country MEPs on Wednesday approved a new EU law setting out patients' rights to seek medical care in another EU country. The legislation clarifies the rules for reimbursement, including when advance authorisation may be required.
French MEP Françoise Grossetête (EPP), who led discussions in Parliament, commented: "Patients will no longer be left to their own devices when they seek cross border healthcare and reimbursement. This directive will at last clear up patients' rights because until now they have been very vague."
The new rules clarify that EU citizens can be reimbursed for healthcare they receive in another Member State, as long as the type of treatment and costs would have normally been covered in their own country.
Authorities may require that patients seek ‘prior authorisation’ for treatments requiring overnight hospital stays or specialised healthcare. On the insistence of MEPs, any refusal will need to be justified according to a restricted list of possible reasons, which includes certain risks to the patient or general public.
Each country must establish a ‘contact point’ to provide information to patients considering seeking treatment abroad. Contact points will also provide assistance if problems occur.
Seeking healthcare abroad could particularly benefit patients on long waiting lists, or those unable to find specialist attention. MEPs strengthened provisions for cooperation on rare diseases, since awareness can be low and experts are often few and far between.
As a general rule, most patients prefer to receive treatment close to home. Currently, 1% of Member States’ health budgets are spent on crossborder healthcare.
The rules concern only to those who choose to seek treatment abroad. The European Health Insurance Card scheme will continue to apply for citizens who require urgent treatment when visiting another EU country.
Next steps
The text approved by MEPs is the result of an agreement reached with Council, which must also give its formal approval. Once signed into law, Member States have 30 months to make changes to their national legislation .

Hungary's six-month presidency of Council launched in Parliament
PM Orbán calls for better economic policy coordination Says he will accept European Commission opinion on Media Law Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán put the economy at the top of the agenda for Hungary's six-month presidency of the Council of Ministers when he outlined his priorities to MEPs on Wednesday morning. The debate became quite heated at times as Mr Orbán came in for criticism over Hungary's controversial media law.
Opening his country's first presidency of the Council of Ministers, Prime Minister Orbán referred to the 1956 uprising and subsequent Communist repression, underlining the "historic justice" in Hungary the European country which had "given the most blood for freedom" in Europe since World War II.
On current problems, he focused on indebtedness, saying it can only be overcome through employment, prudent economic management and not indebting our children's future. He also pointed to the need to modify the Lisbon Treaty in order to introduce the planned permanent crisis mechanism by 2013.
In this field, his speech ranged over better economic policy coordination, economic growth, sustainable creation of jobs, deregulation and the creation of a supportive business environment for small and medium size enterprises. Mr Orbán asked the EP's support for 6 pieces of legislation in the economic field.
Enlargement – He said that there is a fear of enlargement in Europe. "I find it unjust that Croatia is still outside the EU. Orbán wants Croatia's accession treaty to be signed by the end of the Hungarian presidency. He reiterated support for Bulgaria and Romania to join Schengen as soon as possible.
Further priorities of the Hungarian Presidency are energy policy and innovation, a Danube strategy, climate change, family policy, demographic situation, freedom of religion, EU action against persecution of Christians and the inclusion of Roma.
Hungarian Media Act – Orbán reiterated his government's readiness to modify the Media Act, if the European Commission requires it to do so to ensure its conformity with European law.
Reaction of Parliament's Political Groups
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said "lets give our full support to Hungary" as "there is a lot to do". On the media law he said "the principle of press freedom is a sacred one for the EU" . He said Hungary has said "adjustments will be made" if after assessing the law the Commission decides that it is necessary.
French MEP Joseph Daul (EPP) said "I have confidence in you that you will respect the letter and the spirit of the European rules". Mr Daul sees the main priority this year as stability of the euro. "It is perhaps a good thing that the two presidencies in 2011 will be taken on by countries (Hungary and Poland) who don't belong to the euro, but who are thinking of coming in very quickly. They have an interest in stability of the currency".
German Member Martin Schulz (S&D) said the media law was not in line with European rule of law: " In democracy it's the media that scrutinises power. What you are doing is that the power is scrutinizing the media". He said he didn't want the topic to dominate the Hungarian Presidency saying "withdraw your act and come back with better new balanced one".
Belgian Liberal Guy Verhofstadt (ALDE) supports the priorities of the Hungarian presidency. "You have one top priority, it is to establish real economic governance inside the EU and inside the euro zone." On the media law issue he said "the aim of media governance is not to guarantee proper and adequate information, it's to uphold pluralism and guarantee that any initiative can be developed."
French MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit (Greens/EFA) said that "Orbán is a politician who is worth respect", but the media law shows that today he "does not understand the nature and the structure of democracy". "A strong Europe has to be credible" and "the basis of democracy is freedom of expression".
MEPs from the Greens had greeted the Hungarian Prime Minister with tape over their mouths and holding placards with the script "Censored" to protest against Hungary's adoption of its controversial Media Act last December.
Hungarian MEP Lajos Bokros (ECR) pointed out recent adopted governmental 'measures against solidarity' (for example the elimination of the budget council, nationalisation of private pension system) and said "there is a risk that all these measures will distract the attention from the Hungarian Presidency and that's a terrible shame"
Lothar Bisky, a German MEPs from the GUE/NGL group agreed that it is not up to the government to control the media. "The media has to scrutinise and control the government and the economy and that it is how it should stay." He went on to say that "the EU is still primarily a West-European affair and we are looking for more Eastern-European input from your presidency".
British MEP Nigel Farage (EFD) compared the EU to the Soviet Union that Orbán was fighting against 20 years ago: "You will meet lots of communists in the next 6 months including Mr Barroso". He appealed on Orbán to wake up and stand for EU democracy.
In his closing remarks, Mr Orbán referred to the media law, regretting misunderstandings which had taken the discussion off track", but said he puts his "faith in the Commission" to come with "a solution for this problem, which I will accept". He deplored the "offence" caused by some speakers to Hungary and Hungarians "by saying that we are heading towards dictatorship".

Christians in Middle East: MEPs condemn persecution, discrimination based on religion
On Wednesday evening (19 January) President Jerzy Buzek and many MEPs from across the European Parliament held a candle lit vigil and a moments silence for the victims of recent terrorist attacks against Christians. Support for embattled Christian communities Members stress right to practice any religion The recent attacks on Christians in the Middle East and in particular in Iraq and Egypt have highlighted the dangers that these ancient and dwindling communities face. Members of the European Parliament from across the political divide joined together to condemn violence against Christians and any violence based on religion when they debated the situation of Christians on Wednesday (19 January). The following day they adopted a resolution on the debate.
Resolution adopted
In the resolution adopted on 20 January MEPs condemned attacks in as Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Cyprus, Iran and Iraq, They also want the forthcoming External Affairs Council of 31 January 2011 to discuss the persecution of Christians and respect for religious freedom.
The forcible interruption by the Turkish authorities of the Christmas Mass celebrated on Christmas Day by the remaining 300 Christians in the northern part of Cyprus is also condemned in the resolution.
MEPs also denounce "the instrumentalisation of religion in various political conflicts". The resolution also calls for a strategy to enforce the human right to freedom of religion, including a list of measures against states who knowingly fail to protect religious denominations.
Wednesday's debate
The European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton opened the debate saying that "the EU will not turn a blind eye" to the persecutions of Christians around the world. She condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Iraq and Egypt and the assassination of Mr Taseer, Governor of Punjab in Pakistan. On dealing with the threat, she said, "we must not fall into the trap that extremists and terrorists are laying before us. We must resist the manipulation of religion into a source of division. The best response to extremism is a united international front based on the universal standards of freedom of religion and belief".
Veteran German Christian Democrat Elmar Brok said that the EU must speak out firmly in condemning the attacks on Christians. Referring to the birthplace of Christianity, he said the world ran the risk that "2000 years of tradition could end" He also warned that Bethlehem, the birth place of Jesus could "be devoid of Christians" if current trends continue. He widened the debate to speak of the persecution that Christians in China also face.
Speaking for the Socialist Group, Johannes Swoboda strongly condemned recent attacks against Christians in the Middle East. He said the persecution in Iraq was hardly the intention of the international community when Saddam Hussein was removed. He also warned against what he termed "Islamophobia" from certain people in Europe.
Dutch Liberal Marietje Schaake painted "a very bleak picture" of the plight of Christians in the Middle East. She said that extremists were using violence in the name of others and some were trying to be above there law. She condemned violence as "terrorism" saying it was a "crime".
The fundamental right to have any religion or none was the point made by French MEP Nicole Kiil-Nielsen for the Green Group. She said that Europe must not allow extremists to dominate the agenda and give a false impression of Muslims. She said that Christians in the Middle East no more represent the policies of the Europe than Muslims in Europe represent the Middle East.
Polish MEP Konrad Szymański (European Conservatives and Reformists) thanked Catherine Ashton for her reaction to the attacks on Coptic Christian in Egypt and stressed the importance of Europe giving a strong voice to the world in stating the welfare of Christians is important and will play a role in how the EU conducts international agreements.
Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) drew Parliament's attention to the UN Charter of Fundamental Rights which explicitly states the right to freedom of religious worship.
Fiorello Provera for the Europe of freedom and democracy Group noted the "systematic discrimination of Christians across the Middle East. He specifically referred to the fact that in Egypt and Iraq they are not allowed to build Churches or hold positions of authority. He said that in Iraq such policies and associated violence had led top 600,000 Christian leaving the country.

MEPs spell out sanctions EU should take against Belarus authorities
A man shows the 'Victory' sign from a barred window of a prison in Minsk, Belarus, in which detained participants from the 19 December protests have been held and of whom some were released on 29 December 2010. ©BELGA The EU must impose a travel ban and asset freeze on Belarusian officials, judges and security officers Further targeted economic sanctions against the government should be considered The EU must impose a travel ban and asset freeze on Belarusian officials, judges and security officers involved in the violent election crackdown of 19 December 2010, say MEPs in a resolution adopted on Thursday. Lifting these measures should be conditional upon the release of imprisoned opposition leaders, they add.
The resolution condemns in the strongest terms possible the brutal repression by the police and KGB on Election Day and "calls for an independent and impartial international investigation into the events" under the OSCE auspices. MEPs also demand a re-run of the elections in accordance with international standards.
Tough sanctions
In line with the joint statement issued on 12 January by European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek and several EP committees and delegations, MEPs restate their demand for an EU travel ban and financial asset freeze to be imposed on Belarusian authorities, state officials, members of the judiciary and security officers responsible for the brutal post-election repression. These sanctions, they say, should remain in force "minimum until all political prisoners and detainees are released".
Further targeted economic sanctions against the government should be considered, believe MEPs, such as a freeze of all financial aid provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
Support the opposition movement
The EU must ease visa access to the EU for Belarusian citizens and amplify its financial support to independent media (such as TV Belsat, European Radio for Belarus or Radio Racja) and NGOs promoting democracy and opposing the regime. At the same time, the Commission's assistance to state-owned media in the country must be halted and NGOs banned in the country should be registered and be able to benefit from EU programmes.
State terror against a child
MEPs note with concern the attempts of the Belarusian authorities to take into state custody Danil Sannikov, 3-year-old son of presidential candidate Andrei Sannikov and investigative journalist Irina Khalip, after both parents were imprisoned on Election Day. Danil is currently living with his grandmother.
