European elections 4-7 June 2009 In June of this year, Irish voters will be asked to choose their candidates to represent them in the European Parliament. These elections will take place simultaneously in the 27 EU Member States and Ireland will elect 12 out of the total 736 MEPs.
The Irish MEPs are divided into four constituencies - Dublin (3 seats), East (3 seats), South (3 seats) and North West (3 seats). Since the last European elections in 2004, two major changes have taken place - the Dublin constituency has been reduced from 4 to 3 seats and two counties (Longford and Westmeath) have been moved from the East constituency to the North West constituency.
Any EU citizen over the age of 21 and resident in Ireland is eligible to be a candidate for the elections. Political party candidates must be nominated by their party, whereas independent candidates may nominate themselves, but have to be supported by 60 signatories (all signatories must be on the electoral register within the relevant constituency).
The definitive list of Irish candidates will be available in early May 2009 after the deadline for registration of candidates has expired (a month before the elections). Several candidates have already been chosen by their respective parties and others have been informally indicated.
A final important feature is that both party and non-party candidates have to present a list of replacement candidates, to ensure that MEPs who retire/resign from the European Parliament can be replaced by the next available candidate on their replacement list.
Note: If the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force following the European Elections, the number of MEPs in the European Parliament will be increased from 736 to 754, according to transitional measures agreed at the December summit meeting of the European Council. These transitional measures would then apply until the end of the 2009-2014 term. No change would be made to the number of Irish MEPs under these arrangements.
