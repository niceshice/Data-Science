The European Parliament will host a major event on global warming and food policy on Thursday 3 December when the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Dr Rajendra K. Pachauri and environmental activist Sir Paul McCartney will urge legislators and experts to focus on what an individual can do to fight climate change, for example by eating less meat.
The "Global Warming and Food Policy: Less Meat = Less Heat" hearing takes place on Thursday 3 December in Parliament's plenary chamber in Brussels, from 10.00h to 12h30, and will be chaired by EP Vice-President Edward McMillan-Scott.
The opening speech will be delivered by Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek and the hearing will be followed by a press conference, while Sir Paul, Dr Pacahauri and Mr McMillan-Scott will also issue a joint declaration marking the event.
The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation produced a report - ‘Livestock’s Long Shadow’ - in 2006, which demonstrated that meat production is very intensive in emissions of greenhouse gases and much less efficient in water use than equivalent vegetarian food production.
On the eve of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen the event reflects a perception that climate change needs to be addressed at all levels – especially individual but also at local, regional, national, European and worldwide levels. The European Parliament will present its views in the Danish capital from 7 to 18 December.
On the day of the hearing, the European Parliament's restaurants will offer a menu on which 50% of the meals will be vegetarian, instead of just its usual one meat-free choice.
