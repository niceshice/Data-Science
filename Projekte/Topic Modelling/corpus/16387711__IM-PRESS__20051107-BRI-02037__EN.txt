REACH - Chemicals package: a difficult balance to strike
2005-11-08 - 16:04
At the time of print, discussions are continuing between the political groups on possible compromises on the REACH package. It is unclear as whether the debate and vote on the important REACH regulations will take place as scheduled. If the vote does go ahead, it is scheduled to take place on Thursday morning (17 November) starting at 10.00am. The position of the Environment committee is summarised below.
Guido SACCONI (PES, IT) was delighted when Parliament's Environment Committee adopted his report on REACH by 40 votes to 19, with 2 abstentions.
The greatest challenge involved in REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) is deciding how to strike the right balance between the obligations to be imposed on industry and the need to protect health and the environment. On 13 September the Committees on Industry and the Internal Market had indicated that they would like the burden on industry to be substantially eased. Without neglecting this aspect, the Environment Committee voted to place the emphasis on the health and environmental requirements which provide the justification for this future legislation, while accepting numerous amendments tabled by the nine other committees asked for opinions.
The duty of care
The Environment Committee is proposing adopting as a general principle the duty of care of businesses - i.e. the duty to avoid placing on the market products which endanger health or the environment. Producers will be required to prevent, limit and even remedy any adverse effects. They will also be required to inform downstream users of risks automatically and free of charge, a detailed procedure being laid down for this purpose, so that those users can choose less harmful substances. Consumers and workers should also have access to this information. However, the duty to inform and prevent should not burden small and medium-sized firms with excessive red tape, and, where appropriate, such businesses should be able to receive aid.
Disagreements about registration
REACH requires producers to register chemicals and to supply information about their properties. This is the aspect of the regulation which has the most serious implications for business and also has given rise to most controversy among MEPs in the committee. The Environment Committee was able to arrive at a compromise which secured the support of a majority within the committee, although Members of the EPP-ED group did not endorse it.
The committee suggests that the requirements concerning the information to be supplied to the future European Chemicals Agency on substances produced in quantities between 1 and 10 tonnes be eased. But this concession is not an invitation to cheat, as the Agency will be required to perform checks (on at least 10% of cases) and could withdraw registrations if the rules are evaded. In addition, proper chemical safety assessment reports will still be required where more than 1 tonne is produced.
The Committees on Industry (opinion by Lena EK - ALDE, SE) and the Internal Market (opinion by Hartmut NASSAUER - EPP-ED, DE), which are closely involved in consideration of this legislation (under the 'enhanced cooperation' procedure provided for by Rule 47 of the EP's Rules of Procedure) tabled a series of amendments on this aspect, which, like the amendments tabled by the Environment Committee, will be put to the vote directly in plenary. The Committee on the Internal Market, in particular, wishes to ease the information requirements where the quantity produced was less than 100 tonnes, rather than 10 tonnes.
The Environment Committee, for its part, wishes substances contained in articles to be notified to the Agency if their concentration exceeds 1% and when the possibility of a hazard to the environment or health cannot be excluded. It suggests that a 'quality mark' be placed on articles manufactured in accordance with the REACH Regulation.
The Environment Committee proposes adding various entries to the list of products exempt from registration, particularly minerals, foods, polymers and substances for use in product and process orientated research and development (PPORD). However, these exemptions must not lead to discrimination between products and substances manufactured in the EU and those which are imported.
One substance, one registration
In order to ease the burden on businesses, REACH allows them the option of forming consortia for the purpose of submitting data to the Agency jointly. In the same spirit and in accordance with the principle, 'one substance, one registration' (OSOR), various amendments proposed by the Environment Committee reinforce the obligation on businesses to exchange non-confidential data among themselves (in order to avoid duplication of applications). Exemptions would be possible for the purpose of protecting confidential information, but these must be granted by the Agency and on no account could the exemptions apply to data concerning tests on animals. The Agency would be required to publish a list of the substances already registered in order to make life easier for businesses and again to avoid duplication.
Reducing experiments on animals
MEPs in the committee consider that, where the required data necessitate experiments, they must primarily be carried out 'in vitro'. If alternatives to experiments on animals exist, their use should be compulsory. Businesses would also be required to communicate to the Agency all results of experiments on animals and all information which could make it possible to avoid experiments on animals, on pain of forfeiting their rights to registration. MEPs in the committee also suggest that the Sixth Framework Programme of Research should include encouragement for research into alternative methods and that the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) should be consulted before any experiment is performed.
The Agency is at the heart of the system
While MEPs in the committee are divided in their opinions regarding registration procedures, they are more unanimous about the 'evaluation' component of REACH and the central role to be played by the future European Chemicals Agency, which will be set up under the regulation and be based in Helsinki. On these points, the Environment Committee accepted many of the amendments suggested, in particular, by the Committees on Industry and the Internal Market.
In order to avoid confusion and duplication between the authorities of the Member States, and with the aim of promoting confidence, it is felt that the Agency should be 'in charge of the overall management of the REACH process': this applies both to the evaluations and to the granting of registration and authorisations. The Agency would of course be assisted by a network of national bodies, but the Agency itself would decide the priorities for evaluations and draw up annual plans. Many amendments are concerned with the evaluation procedures, the composition and functioning of the Agency and the principle that it is to be independent and its work transparent, as well as laying down appeal procedures.
Authorisations to be temporary and revisable
One of the main aims of REACH is to encourage the replacement of the most hazardous substances (those which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic to reproduction or bioaccumulative). On the basis of the precautionary principle and the substitution principle, the Environment Committee wishes to make the provisions in the package more stringent. In its opinion, authorisations should be granted only for a maximum of 5 years in order to encourage the development of alternative methods and substances. These authorisations would be open to revision at any time, particularly if new scientific data necessitate urgent measures.
Hazardous substances should be authorised only where no alternative exists and on condition that measures are taken to limit the risks of exposure, particularly of those who are vulnerable, and provided that the social and economic benefits outweigh the risks to health and the environment. To the list of the substances most hazardous to health, MEPs in the committee suggest adding ingredients added to tobacco products and sensitisers (substances which cause allergies).

Climate change following EU Summits with India and China
2005-11-08 - 16:04
MEPs will debate the issue of climate change in the lights of the damage caused by the recent hurricanes and the outcomes of the EU-China and EU-India Summits. The Commission and Council will make statements on the subject.
During the EU-China Summit of 5 September, a Joint Declaration on Climate Change between China and the EU was issued, which confirmed the establishment of a China-EU partnership on climate change. The two sides were determined to tackle the serious challenges of climate change through practical and results-oriented cooperation. This partnership will fully complement the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. It will strengthen cooperation and dialogue on climate change including clean energy, and will promote sustainable development. It will include cooperation on the development, deployment and transfer of low carbon technology, including advanced near-zero-emissions coal technology through carbon capture and storage.
During the EU-India Summit of 7 September, it was agreed to launch an India-EU Initiative on Clean Development and Climate Change, with the aim of promoting cleaner technologies and their use.

Winning the battle against climate change
2005-11-08 - 16:04
This draft own-initiative report by Anders Wijkman (EPP-ED, SE), for the Environment Committee, will enable the European Parliament to express its opinion with a view to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, due to take place in Montreal, between 28 November and 9 December.
This Conference includes the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) and the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 1). The report also gives an overview of various actions to be undertaken at European field for the coming years.
The text proposed by the Environment Committee tries to define the main axes of the EU strategy on climate change:
- building on key Kyoto elements - binding greenhouse gas emission targets, a global cap-and-trade system, and flexible mechanisms;
- undertaking strong emissions reductions at home, starting with 20-30% domestic reductions by 2020, using a combination of market incentives and regulation to stimulate investments in efficiency and/or carbon-free and low-carbon technologies;
- adopting a pro-active approach to engage other main actors, notably the US;
- developing a strategic partnership with countries like China, South Africa, Brazil and India to assist them in developing sustainable energy strategies and secure their participation in mitigation efforts;
- vigorously promoting research and innovation for sustainable energy technologies and removing ‘perverse’ incentives such as fossil fuel subsidies as well as internalising external costs, including those of climate change, into the price of energy production;
- requiring the political system to take responsibility for facilitating measures to enable citizens to reduce their own impact on climate;
- encouraging much greater direct involvement in mitigation efforts at the level of the European citizen, a necessary prerequisite being the provision of detailed information about the carbon content of products and services and a future option being a system of personal tradable quotas.
MEPs in the committee also call on the European Institutions to set a positive example by limiting greenhouse gas emissions in their various activities, through enhanced energy efficiency in office buildings and for all equipment used, low carbon travel etc.; special efforts should be made in relation to travel of Members of Parliament, implying a reconsideration of the double location of the EP, low-carbon vehicles for the drivers´ service etc. Rapporteur Anders Wijkman EPP-ED SE A6-0312/2005 Report on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the EP, The European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Winning the battle against global climate change Procedure : Own-initiative

Directive on 'humane' animal traps set for rejection
2005-11-08 - 16:04
The issue of 'humane' animal trapping standards continues to divide the European Commission and Parliament. Members of the EP Environment Committee are proposing rejection of a draft directive designed to bring EU law into line with international agreements reached with Russia, Canada and the United States. It is now for the whole Parliament to decide the issue, which is subject to the co-decision procedure.
The Environment Committee overwhelmingly backed its rapporteur, Karin SCHEELE (PES, AT), in presenting a legislative resolution which states quite baldly that 'the European Parliament rejects the Commission proposal'. The rapporteur argued that the draft directive was 'very unsatisfactory' and 'difficult to improve by means of amendments'. In addition, she said, the text lacked any proper scientific basis.
In 1996, the Community concluded two identical agreements on the trapping of certain animal species, firstly with Russia and Canada and then with the United States. The Council approved the agreements in 1998 but, because national laws continued to differ, the Commission proposed that a directive be adopted to harmonise these laws and thus enable the European Union to comply with these agreements. The draft directive does not cover leghold traps, which have been banned since 1991. The aim is to regulate other traps, for example drowning traps, to make them less cruel. The agreements and the draft directive cover 19 species (muskrat, marten, sable, badger, wolf, beaver, otter, etc.).
In June 1997, meanwhile, Parliament condemned by a large majority the agreement concluded with Canada and Russia because it did not take sufficient account of animal welfare and was primarily motivated by trade considerations.
The use of the term 'humane' in the title of the directive was strongly contested by some members of the Environment Committee, particularly the Socialist, Green and GUE/NGL groups. It was also queried by the Commission's own Scientific and Veterinary Committee, which maintained that the international agreements do not rule out unacceptable levels of suffering.
However, a large majority vote in committee (47 in favour to 3 against with 2 abstentions) was achieved partly because of an alliance between contradictory points of view, between those who thought the directive too weak and those who believed it went too far. Some, including a number of Dutch MEPs, did not want the directive to possibly hinder the fight against certain harmful animals, in particular the muskrat, which constantly threatens the dykes that protect the regions of the Netherlands below sea level.

Legislative and work programme for 2006
2005-11-08 - 16:04
MEPs will debate the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2006. The 2006 Work Programme focuses on the key strategic objectives which the Commission has set out at the start of its mandate: prosperity, solidarity, security and Europe as a world partner.
This Work Programme sets out what the Commission will do to meet these goals in 2006. These are the main priorities for the Commission in 2006:
• As regards prosperity, 2006 will be a critical year for turning words into deeds under the
Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs. Europe needs to foster a climate in which citizens and businesses can reach their full potential.
• Solidarity means developing a cohesive Union which recognises common responsibilities and reinforces prosperity. It also requires us to work together to address long-term challenges like demographic shifts and climate change.
• The demand from citizens for response to threats to security can only be met by working together to combat crime and terrorism, promote health, and minimise risk.
• In external relations, the Union must continue to promote a strong voice in the world, with a particular focus on preparing future enlargements, on its neighbourhood and on Africa; and to use the EU's weight in the global economy to turn globalisation into an opportunity for all.
A mid-term review of the Work Programme in summer 2006 will allow the Commission to take stock and, where appropriate, to amend the priority list.

Arms export code must be binding
2005-11-08 - 16:04
Parliament will debate a call from the Foreign Affairs Committee for the Council to make the code of conduct on arms exports legally binding as soon as possible. However, MEPs still have some concerns. In an own-initiative report by Raül Romeva i RUEDA (Greens/EFA, ES) on the Council's Sixth Annual Report on the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, the committee welcomes the likelihood that Member States will have to align their legislation with the code as this becomes a so-called " common position ." EU Foreign Ministers have acknowledged the need for binding standards for trade in conventional arms.
MEPs in the committee call on the Member States to agree on a list of countries to which arms exports should be banned because they are involved in armed conflicts or violate human rights. They also say the quality of national reports needs to be improved and that minimum standards should be applied. The denial notification system - whereby Member States declare that a certain transaction does not involve the export of sensitive dual-use goods - also needs improvement.
Other issues raised by the Foreign Affairs Committee include the need for stronger controls on exports to countries against which an arms embargo has been lifted, licensing of arms brokering abroad, the setting up of a national registry of arms brokers and an international system for marking and tracing small arms as a tool to combat their illicit manufacture and proliferation. The committee voices particular concern over recent cases in which EU arms manufacturers have transferred their production facilities overseas - they call for regulatory measures in this field.
The report reiterates Parliament's "strong conviction that the embargo on China should not be lifted" until the human rights situation has clearly improved. Adherence to the arms embargo against China should, they say, be included in negotiations about the EU's Neighbourhood Policy and Partnership Agreements.

MEPs to debate WMD arms race
2005-11-08 - 16:04
The plenary will discuss the alarming prospect of a "new and dangerous" arms race involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD) when MEPs consider a call from the Foreign Affairs Committee for effective measures to combat the spread of WMD and to prevent sensitive materials falling into the wrong hands.
Referring specifically to a possible arms race in the Middle East and parts of Asia, the committee says that the EU, acting together with its international partners, should seek to tighten up controls and sanctions.
In an own-initiative report drawn up by Ģirts Valdis KRISTOVSKIS (UEN, LV), MEPs in the committee say there should be targeted sanctions against those who violate their non-proliferation obligations. While acknowledging that a credible threat of force can facilitate disarmament efforts, they stress that all diplomatic and political channels should be used before resorting to legitimate military force in accordance with the UN Charter.
According to the report, the EU should play a more active role in non-proliferation and disarmament policies and also strive for stronger cooperation with the United States against the spread of WMD. The Middle East should become a WMD-free zone. For its part, the EU should make its export controls more effective and help other countries that wish to improve their controls. The EU should also give full support to the IAEA in its efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. The Foreign Affairs Committee stresses that the security of civilian nuclear, biological and chemical materials, plants and laboratories should be improved in view of terrorist threats and that export and transit controls should be strengthened to prevent sensitive materials, equipment and technologies from falling into the wrong hands.
Israel, India and Pakistan are called on to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. All nuclear weapons states under the Non-Proliferation Treaty were urged to take significant steps towards the elimination of their nuclear arsenals. Russia is urged to contribute more to the programmes for the destruction of its chemical weapons and for the disposal of its plutonium.
The Foreign Affairs Committee rejects the development of new generations of nuclear weapons and called for immediate action to prevent the further proliferation of ballistic missiles. Everything possible should be done to convince the US administration to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. MEPs also repeat their call for a moratorium and eventual ban on the use of depleted uranium ammunition. Referring to the 1967 treaty whereby states commit themselves not to place nuclear or WMD weapons in space, MEPs in the committee call for a study of the possibility of negotiating additional outer space agreements.
Welcoming the inclusion of non-proliferation clauses in the latest EU agreements with third countries, the Foreign Affairs Committee says that these should be strictly implemented by all the EU's partners without exception. Existing agreements which lack such a clause should be revised quickly. Nuclear states which have a cooperation agreement with the EU are called on to refrain from giving help or encouragement to states or non-state actors which may seek to acquire nuclear weapons.
Pointing out that Parliament has authority over the EU budget, MEPs in the committee ask to be fully associated with the implementation of the EU strategy on WMDs and said that at least 25% of the foreign and security policy funds should be allocated to the implementation of this strategy. Moreover, in the EU budget one single budget line should be introduced for activities on WMD issues, transferring the present funds for the common foreign and security policy - managed by the Council - to the Community budget.

MEPs launch offensive to improve EU arms procurement
2005-11-08 - 16:04
Europe's military capabilities remain weak. Part of the blame for this state of affairs, argues the Internal Market Committee in a new report by Joachim WUERMELING (EPP-ED, DE), lies with the Member States' policies in the area of defence procurement. Responding to a Commission Green Paper, the committee urges the EU executive to draft a new directive on defence procurement and calls for the European Union to push for further overall harmonisation and standardisation in the field.
EU countries are allowed, under Article 296 of the EC Treaty, to derogate from Community rules on public procurement on grounds of national security in the area of arms production. According to MEPs in the committee, this loophole is being systematically abused by Member States' armaments agencies, leading to a situation whereby most defence contracts are awarded on the basis of national rules. This, in turn, is aggravating the fragmentation of armaments markets, limiting interoperability between military systems and hampering European cooperation in international operations. The Commission, MEPs in the committee agree, should try to end such general derogations by adopting both an Interpretative Communication on Article 296 and a new directive on defence procurement.
MEPs in the committee echo the Commission's view that current policies of " juste retour " (ensuring that Member States get their " fair share " of contracts) and the " off-setting " of arms purchasers' costs through supplementary investment deals in the field of military procurement hinder efficiency and " lead to large-scale distortions of competition and artificial divisions of labour between industrial partners ". The inevitable concentration of the armaments industry, the committee concluded, should be subject to greater monitoring and control by the Commission with regard to competition law.
To ensure more competition, as well as greater transparency and fairness in the awarding of contracts, MEPs in the committee call on the European Defence Agency to devise an Article 296 code of conduct for defence procurement. They also urge the Commission to tackle a host of other obstacles to enhanced competition within the arms industry, such as the restrictions on cross-border trade in armaments within the EU, the exertion of political influence on award decisions and the lack of research cooperation.

Justice and home affairs
Criminal penalties for breaking EU laws
2005-11-08 - 16:04
MEPs will discuss the implications of the recent ruling by the Court of Justice on the imposition of criminal penalties for breaches of EU law. The debate will begin with the Commission responding to an oral question on the subject from the Socialist, ALDE and Greens/EFA groups:
"In its judgment of 13 September 2005 in Case C-0176/03, the Court clarified the relationship between policies under the first and third pillars and the primacy of Community law over Union law (Article 47 of the Treaty on European Union) when it also acknowledged that the Community legislature was entitled to require the Member States to impose criminal penalties, where absolutely necessary, in order to ensure that Community rules were fully effective. That would apply in particular where such rules sought to protect fundamental rights such as those relating to a safe environment, as in the case submitted to the Luxembourg Court.
Does the Commission agree that:
criminal penalties may be applied only in connection with legislative procedures in which the European Parliament is involved under the codecision procedure;
the definition of such penalties should refer in particular to Community provisions relating to fundamental rights such as the campaign against discrimination and racism, data protection, right of asylum, migration policies, etc.?
Does the Commission agree that, in the light of the Court's judgment, framework decisions based on Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union (third pillar) would have to be reviewed where such decisions constituted a measure which was supplementary to provisions adopted on the basis of Community law?
What measures is the Commission intending to take in order to verify the actual impact that criminal penalties imposed in order to ensure the implementation of Community law will have on both European citizens and the attainment of the objectives of the Union?"
The question has been tabled by Martine ROURE FR) for the Socialists, Diana WALLIS ( UK) and Sarah LUDFORD (UK) for the ALDE group, and Kathalijne BUITENWEG (NL) for the Greens/EFA group. Oral questions to the Commission

Development and cooperation
A development strategy for Africa
2005-11-08 - 16:04
Maria MARTENS (EPP-ED, NL) for the Development Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on a development strategy for Africa. The committee calls for increased coordination of European aid, between national and EU-level strategies and actions, but also between Member States themselves, to avoid aid fragmentation and duplication, and to enable the EU to assume the global leadership role it ought to play in the fight against poverty.
On good governance and capacity building, MEPs in the committee stress the overall needs for capacity building, especially in the fields of administration, healthcare, education, economics and democratisation, in the public as well as in the private sector.
The committee also stresses that the EU needs to implement concrete policies and programming addressed to reduce the spread of HIV-AIDS and its impact on children, their families and the communities they live in as the impact of HIV/AIDS threatens to undercut the development gains in most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The committee stresses that a successful conclusion of the WTO Doha Round must contribute positively to developing countries, in particular in Africa. MEPs in the committee believe that this includes applying Special and Differential Treatment to developing countries and abolishing all trade-distorting agricultural subsidies.
The committee also welcomes the renewed commitment on granting 100% debt relief to 18 of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries made at the meeting of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and African Development Bank.

Development and cooperation
Changes to the EU's development policy
2005-11-08 - 16:04
Anders WIJKMAN (EPP-ED, SE) for the Development Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on the revision of the declaration of the EU's development policy.
The Committee on Development says that the overall objective of EU development cooperation should be the reduction and ultimately the eradication of poverty within the framework of sustainable development. It stresses that the concept of poverty is multidimensional - relating inter alia to human capabilities such as consumption and food security, health, education, rights, the ability to be heard, human security, social justice, dignity and decent work.
The report stresses that issues such as prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and the promotion of sexual and reproductive health, gender equality and women's rights, climate change mitigation, trade reform, conflict prevention democracy and good governance (with priority being given to anti-corruption) merit special attention, since if they are not effectively addressed other development efforts may be in vain.
MEPs in the committee deplore the lack of consistency in development policy within the EU, leading to high transaction costs, duplication of work and complications for partner countries; supports efforts to improve coordination, harmonisation and alignment of the ways in which donors plan and deliver aid as set out Paris Declaration and that such efforts should be applied to middle income countries as well; stresses, however, that the proposed Joint Declaration is far too vague as regards implementation.
Finally, the committee welcomes the emphasis on the proper sequencing of market opening in developing countries, but stresses that this entails the right of developing countries to design the pace and directions of trade liberalisation on the basis of their development goals.

Economic and monetary affairs
Occupational pensions: Member States lag behind in implementing directive
2005-11-08 - 16:04
MEPs will have a chance to debate the Member States' pensions problems as Ieke van den Burg (PES, NL) and Othmar Karas (EPP-ED, AT) present an oral question to the Commission on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. The specific issue at stake is the poor implementation of the Occupational Pensions Directive by EU Member States.
The text of the question is as follows:
"On 23 September 2005(1), the deadline expired for Member States' notification of implementing measures relating to the Directive on Occupational Pensions. Only 9 out of 25 Member States complied with this requirement, according to remarks made by Commissioner McCreevy in his speech on 22 September in Dublin.(2) The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is concerned and wants to know the reasons for such a poor record of implementation.
Mr McCreevy indicated that most Member States are expected to implement the Directive by the end of this year. What action is the Commission going to take in the case of any Member States that might fail to comply in the next few months?
What are the role and mandate of CEIOPS in advising the Commission and the Member States on implementing measures? Should these be extended or restricted?
What is the Commission's analysis of the problems that the Member States have encountered in integrating the Directive into their pension systems? Are there problems in the formulation of the legislative proposal as adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, and/or has the framework nature of the Directive led to different interpretations in the various Member States?
Can the Commission indicate to what extent Member States have decided to adopt additional, more detailed prudential rules, notably quantitative rules, and could these create obstacles to the implementation of cross-border provisions? Which other elements might jeopardise the attainment of the full potential of the Directive?
What is the Commission's assessment of developments in the second pillar pension schemes resulting from the serious deterioration of long-term savings revenues in financial markets in recent years and a necessary shift towards contributions rather than benefits-based schemes? In addition, did a different treatment in IAS 19 of defined benefit schemes as opposed to defined contribution schemes in favour of the latter contribute to that shift? Does this not lead to the blurring of borders between the second pillar occupational pension schemes and individual third pillar arrangements, which consist of private-sector based supplementary investment, life insurance and savings plans?
Finally, bearing in mind that the main objective of this Directive has been to release European social systems from some of the burden of financing an ageing society, to provide the institutions for occupational retirement provisions (IORPs) with the efficiency and liquidity of an integrated internal market for cross-border business, and, above all, to ensure that European citizens enjoy financial security and a decent standard of living in old age, what other steps does the Commission intend to take in order to improve European pensions provision, such as in the field of the announced, but still not presented, Directive on the portability of supplementary pension rights, as well as in the field of equal tax treatment of pension contributions?"

Transport
Aiming for a common blacklist of unsafe airlines
2005-11-08 - 16:04
MEPs will debate a call from the Transport Committee for the introduction of a Community blacklist of operating bans or air traffic rights restrictions on air carriers which do not meet international aircraft safety standards. The list should cover not only EU aircraft but also aircraft chartered from companies in non-EU countries.
This call comes in a first-reading co-decision report by Christine DE VEYRAC (EPP-ED, FR), which says the European Commission should develop common inspection criteria together with the Member States, which would be the basis for a single EU-wide blacklist. The Commission's original proposal was that it should simply collate the lists produced independently by the Member States according to their own criteria.
The list would be published on the Commission's website, in the EU Official Journal and on websites of bodies such as national civil aviation authorities and airports. Ticket sellers would also be required bring the list to the attention of the passengers, both at their premises and via their websites. MEPs believed that such information should be easily accessible at all times, in particular when people are purchasing tickets and at the time of departure.
Under the new regulation, air carriage contractors will also have to notify passengers immediately if the operating carrier changes after they have made their reservations, irrespective of the reason for the change. Passengers will have a right to compensation if, after a reservation has been made, the designated carrier turns out to be included on the blacklist or is replaced by another carrier on that list.
MEPs in the committee said this regulation was just one part of a legislative process designed to strengthen the Community's air safety and that further measures were justified, including an extension of the powers of the European Air Safety Agency.

Free movement of persons
Simplifying access to cross-border social security
2005-11-08 - 16:04
Patrizia TOIA (ALDE, IT), for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, will be tabling a draft legislative report on the annual review of Regulation 1408/71 on cross social security. MEPs in the committee are proposing eight amendments intended to simplify the proposal, to correct mistakes and to update the annexes of Regulation. These technical amendments are acceptable to both the Commission and the Council.
The aim of Regulation 1408/71 is to ensure that anyone moving from country to country within the EU enjoys the same rights as someone who has always lived and worked in the same country. Thanks to this regulation, people who move around do not lose their acquired social security rights and are not required to contribute simultaneously to more than one national social security scheme. The Regulation determines whether the citizen is entitled to specific benefits laid down by their Member State of origin, or whether an equivalent benefit is available in the person's new Member State of residence. Almost every year, the Regulation is modified in order to take account of the developments of national social security schemes, incorporate changes in national law, and take account of the case law of the Court of Justice.
The proposal updates the Regulation to reflect changes in national legislation on social security, in particular from the new Member States since the end of accession negotiations. It also completes the simplification of procedures on receiving medical care abroad, introduced by Regulation (EC) No 631/2004, by extending some of those modifications to the identical procedures regarding benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases. Finally, it aims at updating and simplifying the list of bilateral agreements which include provisions on social security that are still in force and have not been replaced by Regulation 1408/71, as well as at introducing technical corrections.
Rapporteur Patrizia Toia ALDE IT A6-0293/2005 Report on the proposal for a regulation of the EP and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Digital switchover - is 2012 feasible?
2005-11-08 - 16:04
Giles CHICHESTER (EPP-ED, UK) and Etelka BARSI-PATAKY (EPP-ED, HU), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, will be asking the Commission about the EU's proposed strategy for the digital switchover. MEPs will subsequently adopt a resolution on the subject.
The following question will be put:
"The transition from analogue to digital broadcasting will bring benefits at all level. It also forms part of the Lisbon Agenda, which highlights the importance of spectrum availability to boost innovation in ICT. The Commission proposes 2012 as a common target date for switching off analogue terrestrial broadcasting and, with a view to the Regional Radiocommunication Conference and the World Radiocommunication Conference in 2006 and 2007 respectively, calls for the flexible use of the former analogue bands.
1. What is the Commission's opinion: is the 2012 switch-off date feasible? Can we be sure that, close to the target switch-off date interference from analogue channels transmitting from outside the European Union will be eliminated?
2. How must the RRC planning approach be presented in order to maintain a balance with the common market and policy development?
3. Will the Commission play a leading role in initiating the research and development relating to new and innovative services other than broadcasting at a pan-European level?" Giles Chichester EPP-ED UK Etelka Barsi-Pataky EPP-ED HU Debate : 14.11.2005

Social policy
Employment committee supports a "social globalisation"
2005-11-08 - 16:04
To contribute significantly to the ongoing debate of how to counteract the negative effects of globalisation worldwide, the European Union needs to act in a coherent way through its internal and external policies, this is the key message of the report by Mihael BREJC (EPP-ED, SI)(adopted by 28:1:1 votes) on the on the social dimension of globalisation.
Certain actions of good practice could even serve as an example to other parts of the world; other EU policies have to be reformed to be compatible with the development policy. MEPs in the committee highlight various actions they believe to be taken at EU-level and expect the Commission to come forward with concrete proposals and the necessary resources.
For the committee, globalisation must be a process with a strong social dimension based on universally shared values, respect for human rights and individual dignity which is fair, inclusive and democratically governed, provides opportunities and tangible benefits for all countries and people and is linked to the Millennium Development Goals.
Social rights, social dialogue and human rights should be given greater importance in the EU's various external programmes. The EU's partnerships should include a social pillar covering among other things labour standards. Through bilateral agreements the Commission should ensure that, at the least, ILO (International Labour Organisation) standards are respected in order to ensure humane working conditions.
The EU should use its bilateral relations to ensure that jobs which are moved off -shore or relocated outside the EU do not end up being performed in sweat shops in the third world but instead, jobs of high quality are created.
MEPs in the committee note that efforts to raise awareness among multinational companies on their social responsibility have as yet had little effect. Therefore they call on the Commission to present proposals on how to enhance the compulsory nature of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and prevent companies who make no efforts in this direction from benefiting from the efforts of others.

The Bohunice VI nuclear power plant in Slovakia
2005-11-08 - 16:04
As part of a joint debate on nuclear power plants, Rebecca HARMS (Greens/EFA, DE), for the Industry Committee, will be tabling a draft own-initiative report concerning the implementation of protocol No 9 on the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant in Slovakia.
The purpose of the Commissions proposal is to establish the legal framework to enable Community support for the closure of Unit 1 and 2 of the Bohunice nuclear power plant to be provided from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.
MEPs in the Industry Committee think that the estimated costs of the early closure and decommissioning of the two units are higher than the basis used for the Commissions calculation. Therefore, they want to raise the EU appropriations from €237m, as in the Commission's proposal, to €400m for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. They think that the measures to be supported using Community budget will be defined in more detail by the Commission in 2006 after it receives the decommissioning plan comprising all the necessary information on the decommissioning process from the Slovak authorities. On the basis of this plan the Commission will give its yearly approval to measures to be financed. The financial assistance from the Community budget should, says the committee, continue after 31 December 2013.
During the accession negotiations, Slovakia committed to the closure of Unit 1 of the Bohunice nuclear power plant by 31 December 2006 and of Unit 2 by 31 December 2008 at the latest. The European Union has already established a specific assistance programme. In the framework of the Phare programme, a contribution of €150 million has been earmarked for Slovakia up to 2003. For the period 2004-2006, under Protocol No 9 to the Act of Accession, €90 million has been earmarked to support decommissioning and the consequences for Bohunice.
The purpose of the Commission's proposal is to establish the legal framework to enable Community support to be provided from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. In the case of Slovakia, Protocol No 9 to the Act of Accession refers only to the Phare programme, which is due to expire and therefore cannot cover the period after 2006. The Protocol mentions the need to continue financing beyond 2006 but does not provide a specific legal basis.

Financial resources for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants
2005-11-08 - 16:04
Rebecca HARMS (Greens/EFA, DE), for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, is proposing an own-initiative report on the question of the use of financial resources earmarked for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants.
According to the European Commission, it is a fair assumption that 50 to 60 of the 155 reactors currently operating in the enlarged European Union will need to be decommissioned by 2025. At the moment, the decommissioning strategies and the mode of management chosen for financial resources differ widely between the Member States. Until the Council adopts legally binding instruments in the field of nuclear safety and management of radioactive waste, the Commission intends, on the basis of the Euratom Treaty, to present a recommendation in 2005 on the subject.
MEPs in the committee recognise that it is important, for the protection of human beings and the environment, that nuclear power plants are properly decommissioned after they are shut down definitively. They consider it necessary to ensure that, in each Member State, all nuclear undertakings have sufficient financial resources available needed to cover all the costs of decommissioning, including waste management. The committee notes that the approach to the management of financial resources earmarked for decommissioning differs from one Member State to the other and calls for the sound management of these resources. They call for the use of the financial resources for equitable investments fully in-line with EU competition law. The Commission should, with due regard for the subsidiarity principle, draw up precise definitions concerning the use of financial resources in each Member States, taking into account the decommissioning as well as the management, conditioning and final disposal of the resultant radioactive waste. MEPs in the committee consider it necessary for the financial resources to be managed and used with maximum transparency, and for external auditing to be guaranteed.
On 28 April 2004 the Commission sent a letter to 14 Member States (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) which have nuclear plants asking for details of how financial resources, earmarked for decommissioning were used.
This information reveals widely differing situations, in terms both of decommissioning strategies and of the way financial resources are managed. It indicates that the majority of the Member States have chosen the option of external management, i.e. separate from the accounts of the nuclear operator.

Fisheries
Action on eel stocks
2005-11-08 - 16:04
In recent years, eel stocks in Europe have declined rapidly, to the extent that some are concerned they may become extinct if action is not taken urgently to reverse the trend.
In an own initiative report by Albert Jan MAAT (EPP-ED, NL), the Fisheries Committee calls for the Member States to draw up national management plans for eel stocks as soon as possible and for the Commission to undertake a range of research projects to study the problem. The subject will now be debated by the full Parliament.
MEPs in the Fisheries Committee also want the Commission to adjust the policy on catches and exports of eel in such a way that enough glass eels are available for natural migration and enough are available at a reasonable price for restocking natural eel habitats.

Constitutional affairs
Operating framework for EU agencies
2005-11-08 - 16:04
The Chairs of the Constitutional Affairs and Budgets Committees, Jo LEINEN (PES, DE) and Janusz LEWANDOWSKI (EPP-ED, PL) respectively, will be putting an oral question to the Council on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies:
"Is the Council intending to start negotiations - and, if so, when - with Parliament and the Commission in order to conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the operating framework for the future European regulatory agencies on the basis of the Commission's draft (COM(2005)0059 final?
Does the Council consider that such negotiations should be concluded before the end of 2000- 2006 the financial perspective?"
The Council's response will be followed by a debate.
The issue concerns a Commission proposal for an interinstitutional agreement aiming to establish a horizontal framework for the creation, structure, operation, evaluation and control of European regulatory agencies. The Commission has proposed this agreement to ensure that the three institutions are involved from the outset in establishing the basic conditions to be met when acts are subsequently adopted to set up sectoral agencies.
