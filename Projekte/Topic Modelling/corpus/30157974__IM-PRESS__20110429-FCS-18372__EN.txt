EuroparlTV Schengen: MEPs to debate plans to allow border checks
Plans to create a mechanism allowing Member States to reintroduce border controls in the Schengen area temporarily will be the subject of a debate with Commission President Barroso and the Council on Tuesday. MEPs will respond to the plans put forward by the Commission on 4 May and outline their own priorities on migration and asylum.
EU diplomatic service and global role under the spotlight in debate with Ashton
Six months after the EU External Action Service was launched, MEPs will hold their first general debate on foreign, security and defence issues with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.
Budget discharge 2009: Police College, Medicine Agency and Council risk postponement
Parliament is likely to approve the lion's share of the EU's budget spending for the financial year 2009 when it votes on 39 reports on Tuesday under the "budget discharge procedure". Only the discharges for three agencies are likely to be held back.
Lobbyists and interest groups: Parliament set to back common register plan
Parliament and Commission registers for lobbyists and other interest groups will be merged if a deal negotiated by the two institutions is approved by MEPs on Wednesday. MEPs want the Council of Ministers to join it, too. A proposal that MEPs amending draft laws should list their contacts with lobbyists will also be put to the vote.
Radio spectrum: extra frequencies for new mobile internet services
Full broadband coverage all over the EU by 2013 and universal high-speed internet access by 2020 are the main goals of the Radio Spectrum Policy Programme being proposed by the Commission and broadly supported by Parliament's Industry Committee.
Textile labels to mention fur and leather
Consumers will no longer run the risk of inadvertently buying textile products containing real fur or leather, under new rules on textile labelling set to be approved by MEPs on Wednesday.
New proposals needed on cloning and 'novel foods'
MEPs are urgently calling for new legislation to ban cloning for food production and to update rules on 'novel foods', following the collapse of negotiations between Parliament and Council in March. EP Vice-President Gianni Pittella (S&D, IT) will present Parliament's post-mortem of the conciliation talks and MEPs' expectations for the next steps.
Bailout for Portugal and the need for further financial regulation
The EU's response to the ongoing debt crisis will be discussed by MEPs with the Council and Commission on Wednesday. The conditions of the Portuguese bailout are likely to dominate the debate but MEPs are also expected to bring up the need for further banking regulation, particularly in the area of crisis management and resolution.
Other items on the agenda
Investing in education and mobility
Culture to spur EU diplomacy and single market
EU measures for freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets
Antibiotic resistance in livestock and pets

Common register for EU lobbyists, interest groups
New "transparency register" EP has had lobbyists register since 1996 Commission set up register in 2008 More than 1700 organisations are accredited as interest groups in the Parliament and around 3900 in the European Commission. The EP has long wanted a joint register and approved a deal between the two on Wednesday that means the new so-called "transparency" register should be online in June.
MEPs discussed the report drafted by Italian EPP member Carlo Casini on Tuesday and voted on it on Wednesday. The register will combine the existing EP and Commission registers based on an agreement reached in November. The Council of Ministers has indicated that it will join too.
The accord will mean the creation of a common "space" for registering and monitoring lobbyists and other interest groups. The name change to "transparency" from "lobby" register makes it easier for non-commercial organisations like think tanks, churches, local authorities and political parties, among others, to sign up if they wish to although they do not fall within the scope of the accord.
In principle, registration is not mandatory, although the EP wants it to be and in order to get a pass for the EP all organisations falling under the scope of the agreement will have to register.
Key points :
joint register will enhance transparency , differentiating between special interest groups, representatives of civil society and public authorities
single registration will make it easier for interest groups
the Commission's "register of interest representatives" and EP's "list of lobbyists" will be unified under the new "transparency register"
Parliament wants the introduction of a system under which all meetings between a registered organisation and MEPs working on a given piece of legislation are declared and registered in the explanatory statement of the report or recommendation concerned
the register would also provide information about the number of individuals involved in activities related to the register, EU resources received by those on the register and will set out procedures for complaints and sanctions
A working group, chaired by EP President Jerzy Buzek is working on a tighter code of conduct for lobbyists and MEPs. EP, Commission registers Report on accord between EP, Commission on joint register EuroparlTV: Forum: tougher rules on lobbying Feature - Lobbying in EP
What's in a one minute speech?
One minute speeches cover huge range of issues Current events, EU policy, bilateral issues, constituency concerns - these all show up in the one minute speeches during the opening session of the plenary, when MEPs can draw attention to issues important to them. Every year MEPs make hundreds of statements, often using this time to react to the latest news.
Until April this year MEPs had made 138 one minute speeches of the 209 requested and in 2010, 481 of 993 requests to speak were granted.
How MEPs use their one minute speech?
To give you a taste of the kinds of issues MEPs raise, below are some examples from the one minute speeches during the April plenary.
Members often focus on current events . Irish Liberal Marian Harkin talked about the Irish bailout and the burden on Irish citizens. "How is this small island of 4 million people supposed to deal with this madness?"
Non-attached UK member Diane Dodds spoke about the death of a young police officer from Northern Ireland in a car bomb attack asking MEPs "to condemn this atrocity and to call for an end to such violent acts".
EU policies are also frequently highlighted. Irish EPP member Jim Higgins asked why the EU has taken so long to implement the law on a common European driving licence. He called on the EU has to do everything possible to improve road safety and decrease the number deaths caused by road accidents.
Greek EPP member Konstantinos Poupakis used the time to call for more help for the blind. "Simple daily tasks like shopping are extremely difficult, it's not easy to read labelling," he said, calling on the European Commission to introduce a voluntary Braille labelling scheme.
MEPs also take the opportunity to raise sensitive, political problems , often touching on bilateral issues. Polish ECR member Janusz Wojciechowski spoke about the Polish minority in Lithuania, Romanian Socialist George Cutas commented on tensions between Romanians and Hungarians in Hungary and Latvian Socialist Alexander Mirsky talked about Russian language schools in Latvia.

Opening of the session: Europe Day, no to homophobia, death penalty in Gaza
Celebrating Europe Day The commemoration of 9 May as Europe Day, the EU's new status at the United Nations, the upcoming International Day against Homophobia on 17 May and the EP's condemnation of an execution in Gaza were the issues highlighted by Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek at the opening of this week's plenary session in Strasbourg.
Every year, 9 May is Europe Day and today is the 61st anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, which launched what has become the European Union, noted President Buzek, who had just returned from events in Florence to mark the occasion.
Moreover, "the EU is now a fully-fledged member of the international community", added the President, since on 3 May the United Nations agreed that the EU would enjoy speaking rights at the UN General Assembly. "We must continue to speak to the world with one voice", particularly in view of events such as those in North Africa, Syria and Bahrain, stressed Mr Buzek.
Another day highlighted by the President was 17 May, the International Day against Homophobia. Under the treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the EU is committed to rooting out homophobia, he said.
Next, Mr Buzek condemned, in the name of the European Parliament, the execution by a military court in Gaza of an individual for collaborating with Israel.
The President then welcomed three new MEPs: Mojca Kleva (S&D, SL), replacing Zoran Thaler, Phil Prendergast (S&D, IE), replacing Alan Kelly, and Sampo Terho (EFD, FI), replacing Timo Soini. These Members will all take their seats subject to verification of their credentials.
The House also confirmed the mandate of new French MEP Brice Hortefeux (EPP, FR) replacing Catherine Souillie.
Agenda changes
The second debate on Wednesday morning with Catherine Ashton, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security, was expanded in scope and will now be on the situation in Syria and in Camp Ashraf and the Coptic Christian Community in Egypt. Final draft agenda
Restoring confidence in EU banks: MEPs demand credible stress tests
MEPs want most adverse scenarios included 3 parliamentary questions on stress tests discussion Tuesday evening Most of the 91 big EU banks passed Europe-wide bank stress tests in July 2010, leading to warnings that the testing was not strict enough. As banks are faced with growing problems in the euro zone and talk of sovereign debt restructuring by some members, MEPs asked the European Commission how it intends to make a new round of tests in mid-June increase confidence in EU banks.
What is a bank stress test?
A bank is a financial institution that borrows money from depositors like us and lends it on to borrowers, including governments. It thus has liabilities (the money it has to return to depositors, if they ask for it) and assets (loans - the money owed to it by borrowers). If assets and liabilities are balanced, the bank is secure.
When recession hits, banks are exposed to losses - companies and households can't pay back their debts in full and if banks bought government bonds, they might not be repaid in full if a country defaults. Assets thus lose value, but not liabilities . If a bank has enough capital it can cover its losses and pay back depositors. If it has insufficient capital to pay back its depositors the bank is in big trouble.
Stress test aim to ascertain if banks have enough capital to withstand losses. If they do not, their stability is in jeopardy and they must raise fresh capital. Governments might have to step in with taxpayer's money, if banks can't get it on the markets.
Why is methodology important?
If tests are too lax, they might show banks to be safer than they are. MEPs from the EPP, ALDE and S&D, in three separate oral questions, say the July 2010 test was not strict enough and failed to restore confidence in the European banking sector. They will question the Commission Tuesday evening.
They want to know:
how the June 2011 tests will be made more credible
why the most adverse scenarios, like a country defaulting, are not included in the test
"This year the criteria should be stronger and more harmonized and the coverage of the stress test should be the same in the different member states. We want a comprehensive and realistic assessment, identifying all the weak spots in the EU banking sector. For this reason the stress test should include exposure to sovereign debt," said Dutch EPP member Corien Wortmann-Kool.
If the stress test doesn't include country defaults and for example Greek debt is restructured, those banks that have Greek bonds on their books will appear more stable than they are Oral questions on bank stress tests 2010 EU-wide stress test results EU financial system still weighed down by risk ECB presents 2010 report to Economic Committee Financial crisis glossary
Dumping of toxic waste outside EU – MEPs want better regulation
Most toxic waste goes to Africa, China © Getty 2 oral questions on toxic waste exports Questions to Commission Tuesday evening MEPs are worried that EU rules on the shipment of toxic waste to developing countries are not being enforced effectively and asked the European Commission to tighten regulation in two questions Tuesday evening.
The Waste Shipment Regulation prohibits the export of toxic waste from the EU, but data from EU countries shows a growing number of illegal shipments, as the level and cost of treating waste increases.
The illegal export of waste means producers avoid EU waste management standards and can benefit from cheap labour costs in developing countries and weaker environmental regulation. The man destinations for toxic waste are Africa and China.
Two recent studies for the Commission say new legislation is needed because member states' reporting of incidents of illegal waste shipments is inconsistent and insufficient.
What is hazardous waste?
Hazardous waste is dangerous to humans and the environment, causing pollution and contaminating those who handle it. It includes chemicals, toxic substances, radioactive materials, waste containing heavy metals and electronic and electrical waste like TVs, computers and mobile phones.
Electronic waste is often marked as "second hand devices", which are not prohibited for export.
Non-hazardous or "green-listed waste" like waste paper, plastic and metal can be traded
EU rules
The EU Regulation distinguishes between hazardous and non-hazardous waste, waste shipped for final disposal and waste for recovery/recycling. It creates a mechanism to ensure that waste is disposed of or recovered in an "environmentally sound" manner.
The rules were revised in 2006 to ban exports to developing countries following an accident in Ivory Coast, where 16 people were killed and thousands affected by contamination when an EU vessel dumped toxic-sludge. EU countries are required to carry out random inspections and report any wrongdoing. They are authorised to open containers and the sender must take the waste back at their own expense if a shipment cannot be properly completed.
EU waste figures
EU produces 70 million tonnes hazardous waste a year
67% of electronic waste unaccounted for
33% of electrical and electronic waste treated in line with EU law
19% of waste shipments violate rules (Commission)
OECD estimates 45% rise in EU waste by 2020 from 1995

2009 budget discharge: Police College, Medicine Agency, Council postponed
MEPs want to set cost-cutting example ©GETTY Parliament approved on Tuesday the lion's share of the EU's budget spending for the financial year 2009 under the 'budget discharge procedure' but decided to postpone the discharge for the Council of Ministers, the European Medicine Agency and the European Police College.
In all other cases, Parliament followed the recommendations of its Budgetary Control Committee and granted discharge. Thirty-nine reports in total were put to the vote.
The European Parliament is the EU budget discharge authority. Once annual accounts are audited and finalised, Parliament decides - on a recommendation by the Council of Ministers - whether or not to grant discharge to the Commission and the other EU bodies for their spending in that year. The discharge for budget implementation is the decision by which the European Parliament "releases" the Commission from its responsibility for managing a given budget, thereby marking the end of that budget's operation.
European Commission
Parliament granted discharge to the European Commission. During the preparatory work ahead of this plenary vote, MEPs had stressed their wish to see better management and control systems put in place for money spent by national authorities in the Member States under the system of 'shared management' which makes up for 80% of EU expenditure. They had also underlined the need for national politicians to take political responsibility for the way EU money is spent in their countries, by signing "national management declarations".
Commissioner Algirdas Šemeta (Taxation, Customs, Anti-fraud and Audit) agreed to Parliament' demands and said he would seek Member States' political endorsement of these proposals. Mr Šemeta also responded positively to Parliament's other wishes, including calls for the systematic use of suspension of payments where Member States' control and management systems prove deficient, better recovery of incorrectly-spent funds and putting more effort into making the rules on spending EU money less complex.
European Police College
Parliament postponed the discharge to the Director of the European Police College (CEPOL), located in Bramshill (United Kingdom), due to its "persistent lack of compliance with the Financial Regulation". CEPOL was the only agency for which a discharge was refused in 2008.
European Medicines Agency
Parliament also postponed the discharge for the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMEA). MEPs believed there was no proper guarantee of the independence of experts hired to carry out scientific evaluations of human medicines and that some experts had conflicting interests in the case of the evaluation of the anorectic Benfluorex. The report also criticises the EMEA's management of procurement procedures and its lack of criteria for recruiting staff.
Council
Parliament postponed the discharge for the Council of Ministers until the autumn as MEPs felt the Council was not co-operating sufficiently in providing information to Parliament.
Parliament's own budget
Regarding Parliament's own budget, MEPs want to set an example in cost-cutting. Among other savings measures, Parliament voted to have interpretation services for working group meetings provided automatically in only six languages (French, German, English, Polish, Spanish and Italian), with further languages to be made available only at the request of MEPs.
Other demands include rules to limit long-distance journeys with Parliament's official cars and special rules to prevent MEPs from employing members of each other's families as assistants. Parliament also calls for a long-term review of the budget with a view to reducing costs.

MEPs examine re-imposition of border checks in Schengen area
MEPs rally to defence of Schengen Most MEPs criticised any attempt to circumvent the principle of a border-free Europe Tuesday afternoon when they discussed calls by Paris and Rome for the temporary re-imposition of border controls within the Schengen area as a response to the sudden influx of North African refugees. Many speakers wanted better control of refugee and immigrant flows, but some questioned whether a crisis even exists, given the relatively small number of refugees involved.
Enikő Győri, speaking for the Hungarian presidency of the Council said, the refugee crisis is a "serious challenge forcing a re-think of border management". The council will look into "how to guarantee free movement and a high level of internal security", she said, noting that any temporary reintroduction of controls should be based on objective criteria.
Commission President José Manuel Barroso said, "free movement is to Europe what foundations are to buildings: remove it and all structure is undermined...The option (of reintroducing border controls) exists under the Schengen system for exceptional circumstances. These exceptions should be an absolute last resort".
German Christian Democrat Manfred Weber agreed that Schengen is one of the successes of the European project and promised to defend it. He noted that Sweden takes 25,000 refugees a year but that hasn't "put Schengen into question".
Daniel Cohn-Bendit , for the Greens, noted that the EU hosted many refugees during the war in Bosnia. "Germany took on several hundreds of thousands and didn't sink." He warned that internal frontier controls would victimise those who are "bronzed, different".
For the Socialists Martin Schulz said 25,000 migrants crossing the Mediterranean is not a crisis and could easily be handled with proper burden sharing. He said France and Italy had created the problem and are now demanding borders are closed to try and resolve it. "You can't simply suspend the rights of European citizens this way," he said.
Guy Verhofstadt, for ALDE, spoke of a "ping pong game by two governments on the back of refugees". The reintroduction of internal borders is "against the essence of the EU" and "out of proportion" compared to the extent of the problem. "We will fight with all groups against the reintroduction of borders checks," he said.
Rui Tavares for GUE/NGL said setting aside Schengen would be harmful for Europe and unacceptable.
"Now is the time to focus on not only providing free movement but also better guarding the borders," British Conservative Timothy Kirkhope said. However, "now there are challenges that did not exist before: large scale unemployment, migration from North Africa, terrorism. The current system is flawed and ill-equipped for these new circumstances."
For the EFD, Nigel Farage said, "The row that has blown up between Italy and France shows that when there is a crisis it is the nation state that wins."
Migration*
650 million people cross the borders of the Schengen area each year
since the beginning of the year more than 20,000 migrants have entered the EU irregularly
migrants went mainly to Italy and Malta

€100 million in EU humanitarian aid to refugees

Early years learning: needs of child central to policy-making
Ideal is for children to stay at home for first year ©GETTY United in diversity? Is there a common EU understanding on the emotive and sensitive issue of the needs and best interests of children? In some countries, like Belgium, the child often remains at home for only 3 months, but in others, like Slovakia or Finland, this tends to be much longer - up to 3 years or more. A report on early years learning, by UK Socialist Mary Honeyball tackles the issue. Ahead of the debate on Thursday morning we spoke to some of the MEPs on the Culture Committee.
"The ideal setting for a child in their first year of life is at home with one or both of their parents," Ms Honeyball said.
The report rejects a "one size fits all" approach to early childhood education and care services (ECEC), for children from 0-6, as inappropriate and hard to implement in part due to differences in educational traditions across the EU.
However, it notes that 0-3 is a critical age for children’s physical and mental development and research has shown that investing in ECEC at that point brings greater returns than investment at any other stage of development.
The report focuses on:
the needs of the child
the provision of better parental leave
the central position of parents as the child's first educators
greater involvement of fathers in decision-making process
The provision of long parental leave is an essential component of an effective early childhood education, according to the report, which highlights wide discrepancies between member states in paid parental leave and entitlement to childcare facilities. Ms Honeyball cites the Swedish model, "where all working parents are entitled to 16 months paid leave per child. This leave is shared between the mother and the father."
"As politicians, we must make sure that parents have different options at their disposal; these range from parental leave (for both mothers and fathers) to various different childcare options," said Finnish Liberal Hannu Takkula .
The report also looks at parental engagement , noting that poor and disadvantaged parents often find it difficult to follow their children's education. Men, too, are often sidelined. Parents should be central partners in all decision-making concerning their child, and ECEC strategies should be rethought to include fathers, it says.
"Early child development is as easy as taking 20 minutes a day to read aloud to children. It forges that essential bond between parent and child and improves linguistic and cognitive skills," according to Polish EPP member Róża Gräfin von Thun Und Hohenstein . "In Poland, a very successful campaign with this exact aim will shortly be celebrating its 10th anniversary. A Europe-wide campaign is the next step. "
Mr Takkula highlighted the importance of children being allowed to experience life. "We must not take formal, organised and systematic educational activities too far: a child must always have the right to be a child."

Cultural diplomacy: To sell European culture and values globally
Dutch Liberal Member Marietje Schaake in her office in Brussels The objective of culture is not only to create art or literature. "Cultural Diplomacy" is increasingly being used as a vehicle to promote liberal democratic values and to foster "democracy and participation". Ahead of a vote in plenary Thursday, the Dutch Liberal draftswoman of the report on "the cultural dimensions of EU's external actions", Marietje Schaake explained what cultural diplomacy is and how European culture can help spread democratic values around the world.
Why is culture important in foreign politics?
Culture or culture actions are used to foster democratization participation, development, education, human rights and freedom of expression. Culture is increasingly recognized as a vehicle to accomplish other goals that are more value oriented.
We see exchanges between students, teachers, journalists, artists and we see elements of development money being used for culture and partnerships with third countries.
This report makes suggestions on how these policies can be used more coherently and how we can make a more strategic coordination between the programmes. Not only because I believe it's a good idea, but because it has already been said in the Lisbon Treaty and the UNESCO convention that culture should be mainstreamed and be an element of every program.
In the report you propose that there should be a cultural administrator at each EU representation in the world. What would be the job description for this person?
Yes, the report proposes one representative in each European representation that deals with the coordination of cultural programmes. This person would know about all the cultural actions and programmes that the EU has and should inform people about it. This can also be done via internet. It is not just about travelling to places and doing on the ground programmes. Actually I think we need to introduce a new strategy on digital diplomacy.
You mention that "new media" has a crucial part to play in cultural diplomacy...
People interact increasingly over the internet. New media can help to foster values such as freedom of expression, access to information and democratic participation. It is now possible to break through censorship and taboos and it’s really important to engage people in democracy and human rights through these new media. This is also a part of the cultural programmes.
Bloggers are basically the journalists of today and people are being imprisoned for the blogs they write or the way they use new media. It's just the reality in the new world - a reality that has not really been factored into the policies yet, and this would be a good moment to do so.
How can Europe defend and monitor the freedom of expression over the internet, and do you think that internet - as we know it today - can survive after recent Wikileaks’ incidents?
It is very important that Europe stands for a free and open internet. It’s important for the freedom of expression and it’s important for democratic participation.
The Wikileaks’ cases are a symptom of how the internet and technology changes democracy. What we should do is to rethink diplomacy, democracy and governance and see how we can make it much more open. Services like Wikileaks were developed in a climate of mistrust of government.
Open government needs to be the standard and secrecy needs to be the exception. So I hope that this moment will be used to create more openness. I hope that trust can be rebuilt effectively between government politicians and people.
Your report also mentions the concept of "Brand Europe". How do you think we can do this? We are many member states, we have different cultures. How can we sell ourselves as a one cultural brand?
This diversity is precisely what makes Europe so attractive. There is no desire to blend this together, it would not even be possible and it would kill precisely what makes Europe strong. Diversity is an image as well. Brand Europe is just to switch the thinking in terms of "Europe in the World" instead of differences between member states. It’s important to think about our position in the worldwide economy because otherwise we miss opportunities and we risk becoming less relevant on the global stage even though we have the by far most attractive cultural landscape.
What impact do you think the resolution will have on EU foreign policy?
The common foreign policy for the EU, which is now being developed and facilitated through the External Action Service should mainstream cultural and digital programs and diplomacy.
If we think of culture as a serious and strategic element of foreign policy, the EU will begin to catch up with the rest of the world. Hillary Clinton has put forward a strategy for global internet freedom. NATO is working with culture to prevent and overcome conflict. China is investing heavily in cultural diplomacy to promote its image in the world, and to attract tourists. There are many good reasons for the EU to mainstream cultural and digital diplomacy, and there is no reason not to make it a priority.
Promoting "freedom of expression, press and access to information technologies" is a key goal of the resolution. How can the EU help the spreading Arab revolutions to move to democracy, can the cultural dimension help?
Being connected to the internet is increasingly important as a facilitator of universal rights. Press freedom, access to information, to documentation and communication of human rights violations is unthinkable without the internet.
Repressive regimes also understand this and crack down on people using the same means. People are being tortured for their passwords, so that opposition networks can be traced and arrested.
Europe needs to adapt its policies to 21st century reality. Open societies allow for open markets, so it is a win-win to both ensure respect for human rights, and to allow for greater market access. This is only one example of how new technologies must be part of our foreign policy strategies.
Access to creative content via internet is also growing, and allows people from all over the world to experience Europ's digitised cultural diversity. While the EU has attractive, diverse cultural content, it needs to be more accessible to people across the world. Draft Report Marietje Schaake Parliament website Europeana
More frequencies for mobile internet by 2013
MEPs urge EU to take global lead Plans to speed up the spread of mobile internet were strongly endorsed by MEPs in Strasbourg Wednesday. They also urged Europe to be bolder and take a global lead in this technology.
Bringing fast broadband web access to all European citizens and businesses, including those located in rural areas or on remote islands, is impossible without wireless internet, which needs dedicated radio frequencies for uninterrupted connection. This can be achieved by allocating the "digital dividend" - the radio frequency bands that will be freed up when Member States switch from analogue to digital television broadcasting.
The first radio spectrum policy programme (RSPP) is a central plank of the Digital Agenda that aims to deliver internet access throughout the EU by 2013 and reach high speed connections with at least 30 Mbps for all by 2020, thus bridging the digital divide.
The allocation of frequencies is matter for national authorities not the EU but the rules on how to divide up the spectrum among internet providers and users need to be set at European level. RSPP will help coordinate the use of the spectrum and promote greater flexibility and availability. Mobile data traffic is increasing rapidly and demand doubles every year. It is set to increase nearly 40-fold between 2009 and 2014.
Faster internet - a key to innovation boom
"I want Europe to have the best broadband capacity and the highest speeds, because then we will be home to the development of all the new services that will be crucial to the modern economy. I want Europe to be the home to the next generation of Googles, Yahoos, Apples and all other companies that are manifestations of competitiveness and innovation," said Gunnar Hökmark (EPP, SE), who is steering the draft legislation through the House, in a debate on Monday.
Parliament's support was reflected in the Wednesday vote on the amended text: 615 votes for, 26 against and 16 abstentions.
800 MHz - mobile internet frequency from 2013
Under the Commission's plans, EU countries would have to make the 800 MHz frequency band available for harmonised use of wireless broadband services by 1 January 2013. Parliament passed an amendment which would allow Member States to ask for a postponement until the end of 2015, or even longer, if they have problems in cross-border frequency coordination with neighbouring third countries.
After 2013, MEPs want the EU to be even bolder: bands of 1.5 GHz and 2.3 GHz should also be made available for mobile broadband, while the spectrum allocated for mobile data traffic should reach at least 1200 MHz by 2015, they say. In addition, the Commission should monitor technological developments and the efficiency of spectrum use to assess whether additional frequencies (such as the 700 MHz band) should also be harmonised to make room for new users and services.
Next steps
The Council will discuss the plans on 27 May. There is no agreement yet on the final draft text between the Council and Parliament. Profile of rapporteur Gunnar Hökmark (EPP, SE)
MEPs back joint Parliament-Commission register of lobbyists
MEPs urge Council to join register MEPs gave their backing on Wednesday to plans for a joint register of lobbyists and other interest groups seeking access to Parliament and the Commission. Parliament urges that lobbyists' exchanges with lead MEPs be listed in a "legislative footprint annex" to parliamentary reports. It also hopes the Council of Ministers will take part in this "transparency register".
Rapporteur Carlo Casini (EPP, IT) said in a debate on Tuesday that the texts approved are "a first step towards greater transparency". He added "I think this is a clear indication of our commitment to the value of transparency."
A joint register of the two institutions will enhance transparency, argue MEPs, as citizens will find in one place all the information on people and organisations that are in contact with the EU institutions. This "one-stop shop" system should also make the registration of representatives of specific interests easier.
The register will combine the existing Parliament and Commission registers, as agreed by the two institutions in November 2010. The name change, from "lobby" to "transparency", will make it easier for non-commercial organisations, such as think-tanks, churches and religious communities, to sign up to such a register.
Voluntary or mandatory?
Registration will not be mandatory under the rules as agreed by Parliament and the Commission. However, MEPs have decided that for lobbyists wishing to enter Parliament's premises, registration will indeed be compulsory.
MEPs also call on the Council of Ministers to join the register as soon as possible and welcome the fact that the Council has indicated it will do so.
" Legislative footprint" and other information
Parliament also endorsed a proposal for a "legislative footprint annex" to reports drafted by MEPs. This annex would list all the lobbyists whom lead MEPs met while a legislative report was being drafted.
The new joint register will provide further information, such as the number of individuals involved in any activities relating to the register and any EU funding or support received by the registrant. It will also set out procedures for handling complaints and sanctions.
In a separate vote on Parliament's internal rules, MEPs decided they should update their financial declarations "as soon as changes occur" and at least once a year.
Background
Parliament has had a lobby register since 1996 and the Commission has had one since 2008. Parliament passed a resolution in 2008 calling for a joint register, including the Council of Ministers. Parliament and the Commission then set up a working group that agreed in November 2010 on arrangements for a joint register. The common register is scheduled to be available online in June 2011.

Parliament approves new textile labelling rules for fur and leather
Goods containing fur, leather must be clearly labelled Consumers will no longer risk inadvertently buying textiles that contain real fur or leather, thanks to new textile labelling rules approved by Parliament on Wednesday. The new rules should also ensure that new fibres and innovative products reach the market faster. The Commission will be asked for an assessment report, by 2013, on a possible origin labelling scheme, which may be accompanied by a legislative proposal.
On Wednesday MEPs approved, by a show of hands, a second-reading agreement struck by Parliament and the Council just before Easter on a new regulation on textile labelling. Parliament's negotiators, led by Dutch MEP Toine Manders (ALDE), won concessions from Member States on mandatory labelling of fur and leather parts and a feasibility study on origin labelling.
Fur and leather must be mentioned
Any use of animal-derived materials will have to be clearly stated on textile product labels. Fur is often used to trim relatively inexpensive garments and it is often hard for consumers to distinguish between real fur and good quality fake fur. Parliament has ensured that textiles containing such products must be labelled "contains non-textile parts of animal origin" to enable consumers to identify them. Allergy sufferers, for whom fur is a potential health hazard, will be among the beneficiaries.
The Commission is also asked to carry out a study, by 30 September 2013, on hazardous substances to assess whether there is a causal link between allergic reactions and chemical substances (e.g. colourings, biocides or nanoparticles), used in textile products.
"Made in" labels
Parliament had sought to make origin labelling mandatory for textile products imported from third countries. This proposal proved very controversial for some Member States. Although Parliament pushed throughout the negotiations for this requirement to be included, the Council did not agree.
However, the Council did agree to ask the Commission to present a study, also by 30 September 2013, on the feasibility of an origin labelling scheme to give consumers "accurate information on the country of origin and additional information ensuring full traceability of textile products". This assessment report may be accompanied by a legislative proposal.
Possible new labelling requirements and new technologies
The Commission's report should also assess the feasibility of harmonising care labelling requirements (currently voluntary), an EU-wide uniform size labelling system for clothes and the indication of allergenic substances.
Parliament also stresses the need to assess how new technologies, such as micro-chips or radio-frequency identification (RFID), could in future be used instead of traditional labels to convey information to consumers.
Exemption for self-employed tailors
The new regulation also provides for an exemption from mandatory labelling requirements for customised textile products made up by self-employed tailors.
Next steps
After today's approval by Parliament, the new textile labelling rules on textile labelling must still be formally signed by the Member States. The new regulation will enter into force 20 days after its publication in the EU Official Journal. However, for the new labelling requirements, such as the rules on labelling of fur parts, there will be a 2 ½ year transition period to allow the industry time to adapt.

Greater EU unity needed on Arab revolts and tougher sanctions on Syria
EU diplomatic service under the spotlight A stronger and more united EU stance on the Arab uprisings was a key demand made by MEPs in a debate with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton on Wednesday. The ALDE, ECR and Green groups criticised the EU's approach towards Syria as unbalanced and called for President Bassar Al-Assad to be included on the list of Syrian officials sanctioned by the EU.
More broadly, the EU's foreign, security and defence policies need a new roadmap, said Parliament said in three resolutions adopted following the debate, which was held six months after the launch on 1 December 2010 of the EU External Action Service headed by Baroness Ashton.
Syria, Bahrain, Yemen
The situation in Syria is "a huge disaster" and is becoming "an Arab Tiananmen", argued ALDE leader Guy Verhofstadt (BE) in the debate. His group, together with leaders of the ECR and Greens/EFA groups, called for President Bassar Al-Assad to be included "as soon as possible" on the list of Syrian officials subject to EU sanctions. The Council agreed on Friday 6 May to impose travel bans and asset freezes on 13 high-level Syrian officials but left out the name of the President Al-Assad.
Calls for an arms embargo by EU Member States on Syria, Yemen and Bahrain and for a moratorium on the executions of four Bahraini protestors were among key demands made in the first two resolutions, drafted by Gabriele Albertini (EPP, IT) and Roberto Gualtieri (S&D, IT). Parliament also urged the EU to suspend ongoing negotiations for an Association Agreement with Syria.
Libya
During the debate, Parliament applauded Lady Ashton's announcement that an EU office will be opened in Benghazi "to assist the people and the Interim Transitional National Council".
The UN mandate to protect Libyans should not be exceeded by using disproportionate force, warned the resolution. MEPs urged the High Representative to work closely with the Libyan opposition force, the Interim Transitional National Council, and to "play a strong role in fostering political initiatives" to secure an early ceasefire in the country and stop the bloodshed. The goal must be the resignation of Gaddafi and the provision of immediate humanitarian aid to Misrata and other regions of Libya.
Further priorities
Other messages, backed by many MEPs in the debate, were the need to investigate the killing of Iranian dissidents in Camp Ashraf in Iraq and to make progress in resolving the Middle East conflict.
While most groups called for Palestinian taxes to be turned over by Israel to the Palestinian territories, the ECR and EFD groups spoke against the EU maintaining relations with Hamas, despite its recent reconciliation with Fatah. "Our position on Hamas has not changed", replied Lady Ashton, "but I don't consider the flotilla to be the right response to the humanitarian situation in Gaza", she said in a response to the GUE group's initiative to include two MEPs in a new flotilla scheduled for 13 June.
The release of political prisoners in Belarus and an investigation into organ trafficking allegations in Kosovo were among MEPs' other demands in the resolutions. More generally, Parliament stressed that the EU should learn lessons from the past and place human rights at the top of its agenda with third countries and in international agreements, such as those being negotiated with Russia and India.
Permanent UN seat for the EU
To strengthen the EU's presence in key multilateral organisations, a third resolution drafted by María Muñiz de Urquiza (S&D, ES) called for a reform of the United Nations whereby the EU would be able to have a permanent seat on the Security Council. The UN General Assembly voted on 3 May to grant the EU enhanced status, entitling EU officials to address the Assembly but without voting rights.

Schengen, foreign policy dominate May Strasbourg plenary
EP celebrated Europe Day 9 May While Europe celebrated its 61st birthday this week, MEPs recalled that "Europe is not a given", but a task ahead of us. They criticised the possible reintroduction of border checks in the Schengen area and asked for a stronger European voice on the international scene. Also this week, Formula 1's Michael Schumacher was in Parliament to champion road safety, there was a musical celebration of Europe day and an unprecedented spam attack on Parliament’s Facebook page.
Europe Day On 9 May, Europe celebrated the anniversary of the signature of the Schuman Declaration in 1950 that laid the foundations of the EU. This year is also the 25th anniversary of two EU symbols - the flag and anthem. A piano concert and traditional flag raising ceremony in Strasbourg marked the event.
On Tuesday, MEPs signed off on 2009 EU spending in the so-called ' budget discharge procedure', but postponed the discharge for the Council of Ministers, the European Medicine Agency and the European Police College. The EP is the EU's budget discharge authority, which means that once annual accounts are finalised, it is up to MEPs to give political endorsement to EU expenditure.
MEPs discussed the future of the Schengen agreement and French and Italian calls for the temporary reintroduction of border controls inside the Schengen area. Most speakers criticised the proposition, but some called for better control of immigrant flows.
Consumers suffering from allergies may be the main beneficiaries of the new textile labelling scheme, which stipulates product labels must clearly indicate if textiles contain real fur or leather, both of which can be a health hazard to allergy sufferers.
High-speed broadband for all EU citizens by 2020? Unused or newly-freed frequency bands could be made available for the provision of new digital services, including mobile internet. This is particularly welcome news for rural areas due to the long distances such technology can cover.
The EP's facebook page was spammed with thousands of Syrian pro-government messages Tuesday and Wednesday night. At the same time the plenary asked for tougher sanctions against the Assad regime.
The EP reasserted its commitment to combating discrimination based on sexual orientation. "A person has the right to be different," said Jerzy Buzek at the opening of an exhibition on the freedom of assembly and expression celebrating the 7th anniversary of the International Day against Homophobia .
Road safety Ambassador and F1 world champion Michael Schumacher entered the EP at the "speed of light" to launch the UN Decade of Action on Road Safety campaign. He called on members to make sure that in future eSafety systems are available in all new cars.
Sarajevo - third European Capital of Culture in 2014? On Thursday MEPs suggested considering a bid by Sarajevo to be European Capital of Culture in 2014, on an exceptional basis. Despite tragic events in the 20th century, Sarajevo maintains its intercultural character. This title could help "bury the ghosts of past European divisions".
So-called cloned and other no vel food will not be labelled in Europe for now, after conciliation talks between the EP and Council failed. MEPs called on the Commission to come up with new proposals as soon as possible. EP FB Flickr - May session
