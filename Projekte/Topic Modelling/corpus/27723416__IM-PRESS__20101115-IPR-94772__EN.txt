EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid for 2,554 redundant workers in Slovenia and 1,181 in Germany was approved by Parliament's Budgets Committee on Thursday.
Slovenia applied for €2,247,940 in EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund Aid to help 2,554 former workers at the Mura European Fashion Design (clothing) company to find new jobs.
Germany applied for €8,308,555 in EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund Aid to help 1,181 former workers at Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG's printing machinery plants in Baden-Württemberg to find new jobs.
This aid still needs to be approved by Parliament as a whole in a plenary vote, probably in December.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. The fund's annual ceiling is €500 million.
