Briefing - Strasbourg - 12-15 March 2007
2007-03-07 - 18:50
The Strasbourg March plenary session sees MEPs debate, with European Commission Vice-President Günter VERHEUGEN, the outcome of the European Council on 8-9 March with energy and climate change high on the agenda. German Foreign Minister Frank Walter STEINMEIER and European Commission Vice-President Margot WALLSTRÖM will lead the debate with MEPs on the Berlin Declaration to be signed on 25 March 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome. The House also turns its attention to laws relating to the collective cross-border management of copyright for online music services. MEPs will also debate the issue of a ban on seal products entering the EU.
Monday 12 March
The House will debate Richard HOWITT 's (PES, East of England) own initiative report on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The committee urges the EU to adopt a European standard for product labelling where observance of human rights and fundamental workers' rights are part of the labelling scheme.
Also on Monday, there will be a debate on equality between men and women (roadmap 2006 to 2010). The report calls for the European Commission to give stronger practical effect to its Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men (2006-2010). MEPs in the committee want the principle of equal pay for equal work to be properly applied, paternity leave encouraged, action taken against violence, better integration of immigrant women and promotion of respect for women's rights in the EU's external relations.
Later on Monday, the Parliament will debate the collective cross-border management of copyright for online music services . The Legal Affairs Committee says there should be binding legislation on the online music market, ensuring European cultural diversity is safeguarded. Reacting to the Commission's recommendation proposing to open up the market to competition, MEPs in the committee are critical both of the procedure chosen and the substance.
Before the opening of the plenary, Parliament will hold an event to mark the International Day against Terrorism. Around 500 schoolchildren from Strasbourg, London, Madrid and Kreis (Germany )will be at the European Parliament at an event to mark the day. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will make a statement on this topic at the opening at 5pm on Monday.
Late on Monday evening, MEPs will debate the illegal hunt of birds in Malta , based on oral question to the Commission. The last point on Monday is: One share, one vote: proportionality between ownership and control of listed European companies.
Tuesday 13 March
On Tuesday morning, the European Parliament debates the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy for 2008 . This document is presented every year around March and marks the beginning of the Commission's policy cycle. It outlines the Commission's policy objectives, namely in the four key strategic areas of the Barroso Commission: prosperity, solidarity, security and freedom and a stronger role for the EU in the world. It also puts forward key actions in cross-cutting issues such as jobs, energy and climate change and migration management.
The House will then debate the recent EU-US draft air services agreement .
MEPs will also debate the merits of biotechnology for agriculture . The committee encourages efforts to develop biotechnologies in the EU as one way of making agriculture viable and liveable, and takes the view that these biotechnologies facilitate the development of sustainable methods of production, increased yield, higher quality and more diverse products with less use of nitrates and other fertilisers and rational use of water.
Mary Lou McDONALD (GUE/NGL, IE) will be presenting her report on the ratification of the Maritime Labour Convention which urges that the EU Member States ratify, as swiftly as possible, the Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 2006. The convention aims to improve working conditions for seafarers, thus reducing unfair competition on the global market as well as making merchant shipping a more attractive profession.
Wednesday 14 March
The two key debates of the week take place on Wednesday morning, with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Commission Vice-Presidents Margot Wallström and Günter Verheugen taking the floor on the upcoming Berlin declaration (to be signed on 25 March to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome) and the outcome of the European Council (8 and 9 March).
MEPs will also debate the future of Bosnia Herzegovina . The Foreign Affairs Committee is concerned that the winners of the parliamentary and presidential elections, who were formerly moderate parties, are increasingly resorting to radical and nationalistic language, formerly the prerogative of extremist political groupings.
Also on Wednesday, the European Parliament will debate the future of the European aeronautical construction industry in the wake of the announcement of job cuts at Airbus.
Thursday 15 March
MEPs turn their attention to the banning of seal products in the European Union . In September 2006, MEPs adopted a written declaration calling on the Commission to immediately draft a regulation to ban the import, export and sale of all harp and hooded seal products.
As is usual, the plenary session ends with three debates and votes on resolutions relating to human rights in the world. On this occasion, the topics are: Guatemala
Cambodia
Nigeria

Debate on Berlin Declaration
2007-03-07 - 18:50
MEPs will have the opportunity to debate the forthcoming Berlin Declaration with German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier, for the Council, and Commission Vice-President Margot Wallström at Parliament's Strasbourg plenary sitting on Wednesday 14 March. The European Community was launched on 25 March 1957 with the signing of the Treaty of Rome. The current Member States plan to issue a declaration on 25 March this year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of this historic event. They will do so in Berlin since Germany currently holds the presidency of the European Union.
The aim of the declaration is to review the history and achievements of the EU, issue a reminder of the Union's underlying values and highlight the fresh challenges it now faces. These challenges include energy supply and climate change; growth and the European social model; the treaty changes needed to enable the enlarged EU to function effectively.
The precise content of the declaration has yet to be finalised and will be one of the topics for discussion between EU heads of state or government at the European Council meeting in Brussels on 8 March. Council statement - Berlin Declaration

Commission's Annual Policy Strategy 2008
2007-03-07 - 18:50
MEPs will debate the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy after hearing a statement from the Commission on the topic. This document is presented every year around March and marks the beginning of the Commission's policy cycle. It outlines the Commission's policy objectives, namely in the four key strategic areas of the Barroso Commission: prosperity, solidarity, security and freedom and a stronger role of the EU in the world. It also puts forward key actions in cross-cutting issues such as jobs, energy and climate change and migration management.
The Annual Policy Strategy presents the Commission's proposals for key initiatives to be taken forward in 2008. It also proposes an allocation of human resources to reinforce the Commission's ability to deliver in priority areas. 2008 will be an important year for the debate on the future of Europe and the Commission hopes to see a positive outcome on the institutional settlement. It will also be a year of consolidation and continued implementation of the existing acquis.
The Commission will maintain its focus on delivering results within the overall strategic objectives. Growth and jobs remain a major policy priority for the Union, backed up by further efforts to tackle climate change and to meet the energy needs of the Union. The latest enlargement of the EU will also see further consolidation when new member states progressively join the Schengen area and adopt the euro. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the launch of the euro, the Commission will present a review of how EMU has functioned to date and how it can be better equipped to meet future challenges. The Commission will also continue to deliver on its better regulation agenda, and to give further attention to the proper enforcement of EU legislation.
During 2008, the Commission will draw on the consultation exercises launched on the Single Market review and the Social Reality Stocktaking. These will feed into a range of concrete initiatives. The Commission will also deepen its preparatory work on the comprehensive budget review with a view to issuing a review document in 2008-09.
For the first time, the Commission has identified a series of cross-cutting issues that involve and contribute to several, or all, of the strategic objectives. The main examples are energy and climate change, the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs, and migration. These are issues that need to be addressed both through action within the EU and through a global approach with partners around the world.
The Annual Policy Strategy also identified the main communication priorities for 2008. The Commission will therefore give specific focus in 2008 to the budget, single market and social reality stocktaking reviews, migration, the institutional settlement,energy and climate change and the EU's role in the world.
The Commission will begin an exchange of views with the European parliament and Council on where the policy priorities should lie in 2008, and how this should be reflected in the Commission's legislative and work programme to be adopted in October and in the budget for 2008.

European Council
Assessment of European Council of 8-9 March
2007-03-07 - 18:50
In a debate on Wednesday 14 March, MEPs will discuss with the Council and Commission the outcome of the EU summit held in Brussels on 8-9 March. Key topics on the European Council's agenda are energy policy and climate change, notably the need for binding targets on renewable energy. And, as is customary at the "spring summit", economic issues will also be discussed, in particular the progress made on achieving the Lisbon agenda. German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier will represent the Council and Vice-President Günter Verheugen will speak for the Commission.
Climate change
In his address to EU leaders just ahead of the summit, European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering said "The time for a switch to a low-CO 2 economy has come. This is both an imperative and a moral commitment towards future generations".
In practical terms, he said, "The European Parliament is advocating a binding, unilateral objective of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and a target, binding throughout Europe, of a 25% share of energy production from renewable sources by the same deadline."
The economy
On the economy, President Pöttering told the EU leaders " The aims of the Lisbon Strategy are correct. However, we are still far from having attained them". He added "in the European Union, economic growth has increased in recent months"…."Yet if one subjects these indications of an economic upturn to an international comparison, they are still not satisfactory. In 2006, global growth was 5.2%, as against 2.9% in the EU. Worldwide, 120 States had economic growth figures in excess of 4%. The results are unsatisfactory because the reforms already adopted by the Council, among other decision-makers, have not been implemented sufficiently. We must accelerate the reform process as a matter of urgency."
In a recent speech to the German Bundestag, German Chancellor Merkel, who will chair the summit, made similar points, saying: "Europe will only be able to assert its values and way of life, and continue to win support for them, if it succeeds economically." She too pointed to figures showing that Europe's economy has already become more dynamic. "After 1.7% growth in 2005, we saw 2.8% growth last year. Unemployment – for many people, job creation is the most important issue – is expected to drop from 8.8% in 2005 to 7.3% in 2008." However, more needs to be done, and so the German Presidency will focus on very specific issues at the summit, said the Chancellor. These will include social cohesion, expanding and completing the internal market and creating more flexibility by reducing bureaucracy.
The summit will also discuss the content of the Berlin Declaration, which is to be issued on 25 March to mark the 50th anniversary of the European Community. (see separate Article). European Council report and Commission statement - European Council meeting (8-9 March 2007)

Online music: call for binding EU legislation
2007-03-07 - 18:50
The Legal Affairs Committee says there should be binding legislation on the online music market, ensuring European cultural diversity is safeguarded. Reacting to the Commission's recommendation proposing to open up the market to competition, MEPs in the committee are critical both of the procedure chosen and the substance. Katalin LÉVAI (PES, HU) will be putting forward the own-initiative report on the cross border management of copyright for online music services. MEPs in the committee criticise the Commission's decision to put forward a non-binding recommendation and call instead for a framework directive to be proposed under the codecision procedure. This would also have the advantage of allowing Parliament fully to participate in the legislative process. The committee says this new proposal should guarantee the protection of EU cultural diversity and safeguard small artists and local repertoires.
At present, music artists' rights are controlled by Collective Rights Management societies (CRMs), each enjoying a national monopoly. Artists are represented by their national CRM society in their own Member State and in the other EU countries by virtue of reciprocal bilateral agreements. The European Commission proposes, in its recommendation, to open up the copyright market to competition. Licensing of online rights is often restricted by territory and those interested in trading music on the web have to negotiate in each Member State with the respective CRM. The Commission proposes to create multi-territorial and pan-European licences and to let the artists choose which CRM should represent them, regardless to where they reside. The Commission says this would enhance both competition and technological innovation.
Controlled competition to safeguard diversity
According to the Legal Affairs Committee, however, this proposal risks hampering national and local music markets, instead of benefiting the stakeholders, such as artists and publishers. MEPs in the committee therefore propose introducing controlled competition to encourage modernisation and competitiveness in the online music market, while protecting cultural diversity and creativity. MEPs agree with the Commission that pan-European licenses should be available from any CRM. Nevertheless, they ask the Commission to ensure, in its new proposal, the protection of local and niche repertoires by asking CRMs to provide consumers with a diversified range of music products. They call for measures to avoid strengthening the position of most profitable artists at detriment of lower-earning ones and to assure that all right-holders, irrespective of their nationality, receive a fair share of royalties.

Banning seal products in the European Union
2007-03-07 - 18:50
MEPs will debate the topic of banning seal products in the European Union. On 28 September 2006, the EP adopted a written declaration on banning seal products in the European Union. Text adopted by Parliament is available via the link hereunder. Germany’s Agriculture Minister has said he aims to introduce a national ban on imports of seal products to his nation, after giving up hopes of a quick European Union-wide ban. Horst SEEHOFER , whose country currently holds the EU presidency, said he repeatedly and so far unsuccessfully had urged the EU’s executive office to prohibit imports of seal products. He did not specify when the proposed amendment to animal protection laws might take effect. Hundreds of thousands of seals are killed every year as part of a hunt backed by the Canadian authorities. Animal welfare groups have long called for a ban. The Canadian government insists the annual hunt is humane and sustainable. The hunt produces harp seal pelts that are used in the fur and fashion industries mostly in Europe and the Far East.
The Commission in January rejected appeals for an EU-wide ban, arguing that a 1983 EU law that imposes limited bans on the import of fur taken from young seal pups provides adequate response’ to concerns presented by the European Parliament. The British government said in early February that it would press its EU neighbours to introduce a ban on imports of seal products.
Community measures so far:
In response to widespread concerns about the annual killing of certain seal pups, Council Directive 83/129/EEC was adopted to prohibit the import of seal pup products into the EU. It initially applied until 1 October 1985.
The products concern:
Raw furskins and furskins, tanned or dressed, including furskins assembled in plates, crosses and similar forms of whitecoat pups of harp seals and of pups of hooded seals (blue-backs).
The Directive directs Member States to take or maintain all necessary measures to ensure that the listed seal pup products are not commercially imported into their territory. This Directive does not apply to products resulting from traditional hunting by the Inuit people.
In 1985 the Commission adopted Directive 85/444/EEC which extended the validity of the Directive 83/129/EC until 1 October 1989. The Commission was asked to report after two years on the conservation status of the two seal species concerned and on the development of markets for Inuit produced sealskins and other sealskins not affected by the Directive.
In March 1988 the Commission submitted the report to the Council. In 1989 the indefinite extension of the Directive was adopted through Council Directive 89/370/EEC of 8 June 1989. Reasons for this include:
Doubts about the effects of non-traditional hunting on the conservation of harp seals in the East Atlantic, the Barents Sea and the White Sea;
Renewed public pressure;
The negative consequences that could be expected should the Directive not be extended. Commission statement - Banning seal products in the EU

Agriculture
Beef and veal on the plenary menu
2007-03-07 - 18:50
Parliament will give its verdict on a Commission proposal to clarify the distinction between the different types of meat currently sold in the EU under the name "veal". In a report by Bernadette BOURZAI (PES, FR), the Agriculture Committee welcomes the Commission's approach while demanding further guarantees for consumers. There are two main types of veal production in the EU at present. In most Member States, especially France, Italy, Belgium and Germany, the term 'veal' is used for the meat of animals fed mainly on milk and slaughtered before the age of eight months. In a minority of countries (mainly Spain and Denmark), the animals are fed almost entirely on grain and only sent for slaughter after 10 months.
In the Netherlands, the two types exist in parallel: the 'white veal' (or milk-fed) sector (around 85% of the total) and the 'pink veal' (or grain-fed) sector.
'White veal' is usually regarded as being of better quality and it costs 2-3 euros more per kilogramme to produce. Yet both types are sold under the high-value name 'veal'.
To ensure fairer competition on the market and clarify matters for consumers, the Commission is proposing that meat be described according to the age at which the animal is slaughtered, as this is easier to monitor than the type of feed used. Thus, from July 2007 the following terms would be used:
- 'veal' for meat from animals aged 8 months or less;
- a term such as 'young beef' for animals aged over 8 months but no more than 12 months (though not in the case of Britain and Ireland);
- 'beef' for meat from animals over 12 months old.
For Britain and Ireland, the terms would be:
- 'veal' for meat from animals aged 8 months or less;
- 'beef' for meat from all animals over 8 months old.
In addition, the Commission is proposing to make it compulsory for labels to indicate the category of meat with a letter ('X' for veal, 'Y' for young beef) as well as the age of slaughter. Other information could also be given, such as the type of feed. Derogations would be allowed for the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain and Greece.
European veal production totalled just over 800,000 tonnes in 2005. Five Member States account for 85% of the total: France (30%), the Netherlands (25%), Italy (18%) and Belgium and Germany (6% each). France and Italy alone account for nearly 70% of consumption.
View of EP Agriculture Committee
The report by Bernadette Bourzai, adopted unanimously by the Agriculture Committee under the consultation procedure, approves the harmonisation measures proposed by the Commission but opposes the idea of derogations. It also calls for Member States to be allowed to impose penalties in the event of failure to comply.
In addition, says the committee, the regulation should apply not only to fresh, frozen or deep-frozen meat but also to prepared, processed or cooked meat products. Lastly, MEPs suggest that the categories 'X' and 'Y' be replaced by 'V' for veal and 'Z' for young beef.
Council's position
In debates in Council in recent months a majority of Member States have broadly supported the Commission proposal and appear to have a similar position to MEPs regarding sanctions on fraud and the lettering to be used for different categories of meat. However, some states want derogations in certain areas. The Commission is keen for the procedure to be completed in time for the regulation to enter into force on 1 July this year.

Biotechnology: prospects and challenges for agriculture
2007-03-07 - 18:50
Kyösti VIRRANKOSKI (ALDE, FI) will be putting forward an own-initiative report on biotechnology and its prospects and challenges for agriculture. The committee encourages efforts to develop biotechnologies in the EU as one way of making agriculture viable and liveable, and takes the view that these biotechnologies facilitate the development of sustainable methods of production, increased yield, higher quality and more diverse products with less use of nitrates and other fertilisers and rational use of water.
The committee takes the view that these biotechnologies facilitate the development of sustainable methods of production, increased yield, higher quality and more diverse products with less use of nitrates and other fertilisers and rational use of water.
The committee underlines the need for conventional and organic agriculture to remain successful on its markets. The report points out that the use of new methods in agriculture must be geared first and foremost to market demand if this is to secure the sustained viability of agricultural holdings.
The report stresses therefore that more agricultural funds must be allocated from the CAP to the biotechnology sector, including funds for the education of farmers about the possibilities of biotechnology within the framework of sustainable agriculture.
MEPs in the committee consider it important to acknowledge that biotechnology could present real opportunities in various fields. They believe that beyond the traditional agricultural products of food, feed and fibre, entirely novel products will emerge, including pharmaceutical products such as oral vaccines, products with higher levels of essential amino acids or vitamins or with improved fatty acid content, and that the removal of allergens and antinutrients from products will also become possible. The committee also believes that biotechnology applications may help to reduce the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers in crop cultivation, thus contributing to the protection of the environment and human health.
Research and Development
The committee calls on the Commission and Member States to promote research and development in the field of biotechnology, other crop methods and agricultural product quality by increasing funds for work and further enhancing cooperation and coordination between public sector research and companies at European, national and regional level. The committee also calls on the Commission and Member States to support research on biotechnology applications offering clear social or environmental benefits, including the development of GM micro-organisms for water purification, land regeneration, the replacement of hazardous chemical substances currently in use and the development of sustainable and environmentally favourable energy sources (including biogas, hydrogen and second generation biofuels)
The report fears that the existing complex and extensive implementation of the Community legislation on biotechnological trials and the lengthy approval procedure for placing inventions on the market are creating real obstacles to European research and may lead to research activities and human resources being moved outside the EU.
More cautious approach to GMOs and biotech
The committee appeals to the Member States to guarantee the right of all people producing conventional crops not to have those crops contaminated by GMOs and to guarantee the right of all consumers to choose between food products produced without GMO technology and those produced with GMO technology. MEPs in the committee support the current precautionary approach to the approval of new biotechnology products and accepts that practices based on the existing procedure cannot always be justified by objective scientific criteria, and points out that socio-economic factors, as well as the protection of human health and the environment, should be taken into account as part of the approval process.
The committee calls on the Commission to put forward a proposal establishing workable and proportionate labelling thresholds for the adventitious presence of EU-approved GM seeds in non-GM seeds. MEPs int he committee call for all holdings whose ‘GM-free’ quality label has given them a higher-priced market to be safeguarded by adequate and clearly defined coexistence measures against contamination from GMOs and for the market position they have won, and hence their economic stability, not to be jeopardised.
Public consultation should be broadened
Finally, the committee observes the need to enhance and broaden public debate and improve the level of scientific knowledge. The report points out that the vast majority of the European public are not in favour of GMOs, while not being opposed to biotechnology in principle. The committee considers that it is the responsibility of policy-makers, as well as industry, the scientific community and non-governmental organisations to communicate with citizens in a clear and transparent manner on the benefits and risks of biotechnologies. The committee regrets that to date the debate about GM foods has been unduly polarised.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Putting flesh on the principle of equal opportunities
2007-03-07 - 18:50
At this Strasbourg session, the Women's Rights Committee will be asking the plenary to back its call for the European Commission to give stronger practical effect to its Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men (2006-2010). MEPs want the principle of equal pay for equal work to be properly applied, paternity leave encouraged, action taken against violence, better integration of immigrant women and promotion of respect for women's rights in the EU's external relations. The policy of gender equality should be treated by the Commission as "as an indispensable requirement of respect for the rights of the human person", says the Women's Rights Committee in its own-initiative report drafted by Amalia Sartori (EPP-ED, IT), which was adopted near-unanimously with a few amendments.
Given that 2007 is European Year for Equality of Opportunities for All , MEPs are keen to place renewed emphasis on these issues. Yet they point out that the roadmap - presented in March 2006 - "does not contain a single new legislative proposal".
Equal pay for equal work
The Women's Rights Committee calls for national measures to help women enter the labour market "on a footing of equal dignity and equal pay for equal work" and for the implementation of "concrete strategies to reinforce female entrepreneurship". It also calls on the Commission to revise Council directive 75/117/EEC on the approximation of laws on the application of equal pay for men and women.
Elsewhere the committee's report calls on Member States to appoint "Ms Lisbons" to take charge of gender equality under the Lisbon strategy's employment and growth objectives.
Reconciling work and family life
The report says the Commission should speed up the introduction of policies designed to reconcile family and working life, for example those designed to:
ensure that the cost of motherhood is borne by society as a whole;
make care services and assistance more accessible and flexible;
actively encourage fathers to make use of available flexible working time options and take on household chores and family work, for example by laying down an initial form of compulsory paternity leave.
Action against violence
MEPs urge the Commission to strengthen measures to protect women and children against all forms of violence, including slavery, crimes of honour, trafficking in human beings and polygamy. They want indicators to be devised on these forms of violence and they call on Member States to withdraw the licences of doctors who practice genital mutilation.
A key condition in external policy
"Respect for women's rights must be an essential condition for the EU's neighbourhood, foreign and development policies", says the committee. MEPs call for "greater EU engagement" in this area to boost principles such as gender equality, women's emancipation, prevention of violence against women and their full participation in social and economic life, as well as better coordination with the United Nations. Respect for women's rights must also be key condition of accesion negotiations with applicant countries. Integrating migrant women
The report also calls on the Commission to take "practical steps to promote the emancipation and integration of migrant women", including "measures to foster language skills and understanding of the rights and duties deriving from the principles and laws applying in host countries and from the Union's core values" such as the prohibition of polygamy. These should be regarded as "requirements for acquiring the nationality of a Member State".
Role of the media
Lastly, the report stresses the role the media can play in publicising women's achievements, as a way of creating positive images of women and encouraging other women as well as men to work towards gender equality and a work-life balance. MEPs therefore call on the Commission to draw up measures on raising awareness in the media, for example through permanent consultation forums.
The Commission's roadmap in detail

Corporate social responsibility: a new partnership
2007-03-07 - 18:50
Richard HOWITT (PES, UK) for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee will be presenting his own-initiative report on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The committee urges the EU to adopt a European standard for product labelling where observance of human rights and fundamental workers' rights are part of the labelling scheme. The report calls for the CSR debate at the European level to be 'depolarised' by neither supporting exclusively voluntary nor mandatory approaches. MEPs in the committee reiterate an essentially voluntary approach but enabling - without obligation - research based on clear social and environmental objectives and without excluding further dialogue and research on binding commitments. The committee believes that CSR policies should be promoted on their own merits, neither as a substitute for appropriate regulation in relevant fields, nor as a covert approach to introducing such legislation.
The EU debate on CSR
The committee suggests that a substantial increase in uptake of CSR practices amongst EU companies, the development of new models of best practice by genuine leaders amongst companies and trade union bodies of companies in different aspects of CSR, the identification and promotion of specific EU action and regulation to support CSR, and the assessment of the impact of such initiatives on the environment and on human and social rights could comprise the Alliance's core benchmarks of success; and that a deadline of two years be set for completion of the work of the 'laboratories' set up under its umbrella as suggested by CSR Europe.
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee calls on the Commission to invite representatives from a number of national, regional and local governments committed to using procurement and other public policy tools to advance CSR, to form their own 'laboratory' under the 'Alliance' and to integrate their findings in its future work.
The link between CSR and competitiveness
The report recognises CSR as an important business driver and calls for the integration of social policies, such as respect for workers’ rights, a fair wages policy, the avoidance of discrimination, lifelong learning, etc., and environmental issues focusing particularly on the dynamic promotion of sustainable development, both in support for new products and processes through EU innovation and trade policies, as well as in drawing up sector, sub-regional and city-based competitiveness strategies.
The committee supports the efforts of Eurostat to develop indicators to measure performance on CSR in the context of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy as well as the Commission's intention to develop new indicators in order to measure awareness and the consumption of EU eco-labelled products and the share of production from EMAS-registered enterprises.
Europe's contribution to Global Corporate Social Responsibility
MEPs in the committee believe that the potential impact of CSR policies remains greatest in relation to companies' global supply chains, to enable responsible investment by companies to assist the fight against poverty in developing countries, to promote decent working conditions, to support principles of fair trade and good governance, as well as reducing the incidence of breaches of international standards, including labour standards, by corporations in countries where regulatory regimes are weak or non-existent.
Among other points, the committee calls on the Commission, working with other relevant partners, to organise a major international initiative in 2007 to mark the fifth anniversary of the commitment agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development to undertake inter-governmental initiatives in the field of corporate accountability.

Call for speedy ratification of Maritime Labour Convention
2007-03-07 - 18:50
Parliament will vote on a report which urges that the EU Member States ratify as swiftly as possible the Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 2006. The convention aims to improve working conditions for seafarers, thus reducing unfair competition on the global market as well as making merchant shipping a more attractive profession. The consultation report, drafted by Mary-Lou McDONALD (GUE/NGL, IE) for the Employment Committee, endorses with minor amendments the proposal for a Council decision authorising Member States to ratify the Convention, which incorporates all existing conventions and recommendations on maritime labour adopted by the ILO since 1919 into a single text. It lays down labour standards applicable to the crews of vessels with a gross tonnage of 500 tonnes or more engaged in international voyages or sailing between foreign ports.
The Convention will enter into force upon ratification by at least 30 states, which must together represent at least 33% of the world’s entire merchant shipping tonnage.
With 80% of maritime accidents being linked to human error, the rapporteur stresses the importance of speedy ratification and implementation of the Convention, which should not pose any problem as all EU Member States voted in favour of the Convention in Geneva in February 2006.
The rapporteur points out that it is important to normalise the status of seafarers in order to limit the negative effects of globalisation, namely social dumping, which penalises seafarers and ship-owners complying with the rules in force, and to define decent working conditions. Ratification and entry into force of the Convention would represent an important contribution from the EU to the promotion of decent labour standards worldwide.

Common safety standards for air travel to be guaranteed by the European Aviation Safety Agency
2007-03-07 - 18:50
MEPs in the Transport Committee recommend giving the European Aviation Safety Agency the power to impose fines on airlines or other aviation players if safety standards are not correctly implemented. This came as they gave the go-ahead for an expansion of the Agency's role to help establish common, and properly enforced, safety standards for all airlines flying in Europe, whether EU-based or not. The committee is proposing its first reading report on proposals to give the European Aviation Safety Agency new roles across the whole field of aviation and airline behaviour - including the conditions for operating aircraft and issuing, maintaining, limiting or suspending an operator's certificate. The EASA will also have competence over pilots' licences, to ensure they meet standards of knowledge, skill and language proficiency.
Jörg LEICHTFRIED (PES, AT), the rapporteur, said: "Uniform safety standards at the highest possible level are our objective." He said the EASA therefore needs "not only the theoretical, but also real, practical powers to carry out the tasks it is entrusted with."
Following this line, the committee proposes to change the Commission proposal and give the EASA the power to impose fines and periodic payment penalties if safety standards are not implemented correctly. Sources of information on abuses or non-compliance, notably including whistleblowers, should be given adequate protection, according to another amendment proposed by MEPs in the committee, with the aim of encouraging reporting of such events and reducing the number of accidents.
The EASA was set up in 2002 to help provide a high and uniform level of aviation safety across Europe, by drawing up common standards, overseeing their application in the EU and promoting them at world level. Previously, each Member State had adopted its own national legislation, based on the minimum international standards.

EU-USA Air Services Agreement
2007-03-07 - 18:50
MEPs will debate progress towards the EU/USA air services agreement after hearing a Commission statement on the topic. The House will also vote on a resolution on this subject. Jacques BARROT , Vice-President of the Commission with responsibility for Transport, warmly welcomed the recemt draft aviation agreement reached by negotiators for the European Union and the United States of America : ''I am delighted with the progress that has been made this week by the European and American negotiating teams. It is my intention to submit this draft agreement to the Transport Council at its next meeting on 22 March. We have an opportunity to unlock major benefits on both sides of the Atlantic. In economic terms, this unprecedented agreement would represent a step change - it could be worth up to 12 billion euro in economic benefits and up to new 80.000 jobs. The decision of the next Transport Council will be crucial. The open aviation area could be a centrepiece for a reinvigorated transatlantic relationship."
Following the launch of negotiations at the 2003 Transatlantic Summit and a further 11 working sessions, the negotiators have attained today results that are unprecedented in international aviation since the Chicago Convention of December 1944. Building on the creation of the European internal market – a true success story for the European Union - solid foundations are now being laid for a revolution in the international aviation industry that will see it treated as a "normal" global industry. The first ever EU-US agreement would encompasses 60% of world traffic. It would be a concrete and substantial move towards closer transatlantic relations and a major contribution to the Lisbon Strategy.
Using the momentum created by the joint visit to Washington of the Transport Council President M. Tiefensee and Vice-President Barrot in early February[1], two rounds of negotiations were held on 6-9 February in Washington and 27 February-2 March in Brussels.
These rounds allowed negotiators to identify and agree upon substantial additional provisions that the European Delegation was seeking to complete the preliminary November 2005 Agreement. The absence of a reform in the ownership and control regime in the United States, sought after by the European Union in November 2005 in order to provide access to the US domestic market for EU airlines, had left the Transport Council greatly disappointed. The Council had instructed the Commission to enter into urgent consultations with the US to seek elements that could be used to restore a proper balance of interests.
To this end, the text as agreed on 2nd March provides for:
a) An additional protocol on ownership, investment and control consisting of:
- Rights in the area of ownership, investment and control of US airlines by EU investors;
- Rights in the area of ownership, investment and control by EU investors of third country airlines established in Africa and in non-EU European countries;
- Rights in the area of inward foreign investment in Community airlines by non-EU European investors;
- Provisions on control, notably the development by the EU and the US of a common understanding of the criteria used in making decisions in airline control cases.
- The possibility for the EU to restrict US investments in Community airlines.
b) A unilateral granting by the United States to the EU of so-called '7th Freedom rights for Passengers' to a number of non-EU European countries, i.e. the right for Community airlines to operate flights between a city in the United States and a city in these European countries.
c) A number of access rights for Community airlines to the US 'Fly America' programme for the transport of passengers and cargo financed by the US Federal government. Such rights have never previously been granted by the United States to a third country.
d) Rights in the area of franchising and branding of air services, defined for the first time in such an agreement, to enhance legal certainty in the commercial relations in between airlines;
e) Provisions on antitrust immunity in order to facilitate the development of airline alliances;
f) Provisions on the development of joint EU-US approaches in international organisations and in relations with third countries;
f) Provisions on EU-US technical cooperation in relation to climate change.
These elements are to be added to the existing provisions of the November 2005 agreement, which has been welcomed by the Council on several occasions and provides for the following:
a) The recognition of all European airlines as "Community air carriers" by the United States, allowing for the consolidation of the EU aviation sector and the compliance with the November 2002 Court cases in the so-called 'Open skies judgments';
b) The possibility for any "Community air carrier" to fly between any point in the EU to any point in the US, without any restrictions on pricing or capacity. This freedom does not exist for the moment;
c) The possibility to operate flights beyond the European Union and the United States towards third countries ('5th Freedom');
d) The possibility for the EU airlines to operate all-cargo flights beyond the United States to a third country, without a requirement that the service starts in the EU (7th Freedom - All Cargo), US airlines will preserve their existing rights only;
e) Provisions on commercial arrangements between airlines (code-sharing, wet-leasing...).
f) Unpreceeded Regulatory convergence mechanisms notably in competition, state aid and security. The provisions on security are key in work towards a 'one-stop security' approach.
e) Institutional mechanisms including a Joint Committee to handle any issue covered by the agreement, a dispute settlement procedure with arbitration provisions.
This week, the negotiators also agreed an article on further market access to maximize benefits for consumers, airlines and labour on both sides of the Atlantic since it foresees a transition to second step negotiations with a priority agenda. The article also foresees a mechanism to guarantee the second stage agreement in view of the ultimate EU objective of an Open Aviation Area between the European Union and the United States.
The first stage agreement, if approved by the Council of Transport Ministers, would apply as of 28th October 2007.
Among the benefits, this agreement opens the possibility of an additional 26 million extra passengers on transatlantic flights over a period of 5 years. This compares with current annual traffic of just under 50 million. At the end of the fifth year, this will mean that the market will be 34% higher with the agreement than without the agreement.
By eliminating the bilateral agreements and their restrictions on traffic rights, we can already obtain a reduction in the cost of tickets for companies and private customers, with consolidated economic benefits of between 6.4 and 12 billion Euro over a period of 5 years.
The removal of barriers could lead to the creation of around 80.000 jobs (spread more or less equally between the US and the EU).
The cargo market would see growth of between 1 and 2 percent, which is highly significant given the size of the market globally (with the European and American industry accounting for 70% of the global fleet). Commission statement - EU-USA Air services Agreement

The next plenary session of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA) will take place in Tunis from 16-18 March. EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering will address the opening session. The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA), established in Naples on 3 December 2003 by decision of the Ministerial Conference of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, is the most recent institution of the Barcelona Process. The EMPA opened its proceedings in Vouliagmeni (Athens) on 22 and 23 March 2004. Its first Bureau comprises the Presidents of the Egyptian People's Assembly, the European Parliament (EP), the Tunisian Chamber of Deputies and the Greek Parliament. The working languages are English, French and Arabic. The texts adopted by the EMPA are also available in Hebrew, Turkish as well as in other official languages of the European Union.
Activities in 2007 are expected to include
joint work on the fight against terrorism including implementation of the Code of Conduct agreed last year, with a particular focus on the role of the media in preventing incitement and ensuring human rights in the fight against terrorism
liberalisation of trade in services and the right of establishment, negotiations on deeper agricultural liberalisation, regulatory convergence and enhanced investment to further deepen economic integration.
a ministerial conference on energy, with the aim of agreeing on priorities for co-operation to secure security of supply between Euro-Mediterranean partners, promote energy efficiency and conservation.
a ministerial conference on migration, which will focus on legal migration, migration and development, and illegal migration.
implementing the Horizon 2020 initiative for the depollution of the Mediterranean sea
the launch by the Commission of a scholarship scheme for university students from the region and the holding of a ministerial conference on higher education,
start implementation of the action plan agreed by the first ministerial meeting on strengthening the role of women in society in Istanbul in 2006
The Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, held in Barcelona on 27-28 November 1995, marked the starting point of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (Barcelona Process), a wide framework of political, economic and social relations between the Member States of the European Union and Partners of the Southern Mediterranean.
The latest EU enlargement, on 1st May 2004, has brought two Mediterranean Partners (Cyprus and Malta) into the European Union, while adding a total of 10 to the number of Member States. The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership thus comprises 35 members, 25 EU Member States and 10 Mediterranean Partners (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey).

Towards a Euro-Med Free Trade Area
2007-03-07 - 18:50
An own initiative report on the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area regrets the fact that Barcelona's three main objectives (establishment of a common area of peace and stability; creation of an area of shared prosperity through an economic partnership and the creation of a FTA; cooperation in social, cultural and human affairs to promote a dialogue between cultures in the region) are still far from being achieved. The rapporteur, Kader ARIF (PES, FR) for the International Trade Committee will be putting forward this report.
The committee stresses that customs duties still account for a substantial share of the SEMCs' (the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries) tax revenue. The committee considers, therefore, that it is necessary for the timetable for any subsequent reduction to be carried out to take into account the economic progress made by the SEMCs and the time needed to implement equitable tax reforms designed to offset the reduction in customs revenues.
Financial and technical assistance
MEPs in the committee regret the fact that the EU has been unable to make available funding which is commensurate with the objectives of the Barcelona Process, this being one of the causes of the accumulated delays in creating the FTA. The resolution notes that the lack of financial attractiveness is a major brake on FDI in the SEMCs, with negative effects on the region's economic growth;
The committee recalls that investments have a very important impact in terms of subcontracting, propagation of know-how and meeting training needs in a region which as a whole is under-industrialised, and in terms of job creation.
Agriculture
The report considers that the opening-up of agricultural markets should be defined jointly and implemented progressively and asymmetrically, while providing for the possibility of a certain number of exceptions and time schedules and taking into account the EU's and the SEMCs' joint prospects for this sector and the differences between, and individual characteristics of, the agricultural sector in different countries.
The textile sector
The committee reiterates its concern about the consequences of the end of the Multifibre Arrangement on 1 January 2005 and the abolition of quotas for the performance of the textile and clothing sector in the SEMCs and the EU. The resolution points out that this sector plays a crucial role in the economies of many SEMCs and some European countries; stresses that implementation of a programme aiming to improve the sector’s competitiveness, with Commission support, would serve a useful purpose. The committee considers that the major difficulties faced by the textile sector could inevitably have adverse consequences for the economy of EU countries and the SEMCs and, indirectly, the establishment of the FTA. The committee considers that, when the EU's new commercial and investment strategy with regard to China and, more generally, European commercial policy towards Asia are formulated, their possible impact on SEMCs and EU countries should be taken into account.
Lebanon
MEPs in the committee deplore the systematic destruction of Lebanon's economic system and infrastructures in the course of the recent conflict with Israel, which will cause delays in the country's development and the establishment of the FTA. The committee calls for the EU formally to undertake, in the context of the current peace process, to allocate sufficient financial support to the country's economic and social reconstruction; expresses its strong concern about the situation of the Palestinian territories and consequently call on the Council and the Commission, in cooperation with the international community, to provide the Palestinian population with essential humanitarian aid and call for the Israeli Government to reinstate the payment of Palestinian tax and customs revenues, which are currently frozen. Finally, the committee urges the Commission to insist on compliance with the clauses relating to the Barcelona Process, in particular the human rights clause included in the Association Agreements and the various action plans, in order to achieve a true area of freedom and security in the region.

Trade Committee quizzes Commission on possible reform of trade policy tools
2007-03-07 - 18:50
In an oral question to the Commission, the International Trade Committee is pushing for more information and greater EP involvement in any plans the Commission may have to overhaul the EU's trade policy instruments. Trade Commissioner Peter MANDELSON is expected to respond. The question refers to a Green Paper for public consultation on 'Europe's trade defence instruments in a changing global economy', adopted by the Commission on 6 December 2006. This consultation is expected to pave the way for proposals to reform the basic regulations on EU trade defence instruments (anti-dumping, anti-subsidies and safeguards).
The EP Trade Committee plans to draft a report on this subject after the results of the public consultation and the contents of the Commission proposals are known.
Aim of the oral question
The purpose of the oral question is to clarify the purpose of the Green Paper and allow MEPs to express their views, although without anticipating the contents of the Trade Committee's report. The Commission is asked to explain a number of points, including:
- the main considerations which have led it to launch the consultation and to envisage a potentially major reform of EU trade defence instruments;
- why this step has been taken now, rather than awaiting the outcome of the ongoing negotiations on anti-dumping, anti-subsidies and safeguards in the WTO;
- its intentions behind the various categories of questions covered by the Green Paper;
- the extent to which the results of the consultation will be made public and how they will influence any proposals submitted by the Commission to the Council;
- whether it can promise that the European Parliament will be kept informed at all stages of the process and that the views expressed by its members will be fully taken into account.

Bosnia-Herzegovina - Foreign Affairs Committee concern over radical and nationalistic language
2007-03-07 - 18:50
Doris PACK (EPP-ED, DE) for the Foreign Affairs Committee will be presenting her own initiative report on Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) which notes with concern that the winners of the parliamentary and presidential elections, who were formerly moderate parties, are increasingly resorting to radical and nationalistic language, formerly the prerogative of extremist political groupings. International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
The report calls on the political leadership of BiH to continue in its efforts to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and to dismantle networks supporting indicted war criminals.
The committee welcomes the decision of the authorities of the Republika Srpska to establish a special body with the task of improving its cooperation with the ICTY with a view to implementing the ad hoc action plan; expects, in this connection, concrete results in the near future with regard to the capture of the main fugitives.
The committee is concerned by the persisting ethnic barriers in BiH, which hamper the development of a national identity; takes the view that the constitutional arrangements in the Dayton Agreement make it more difficult to remove such barriers. The report recalls that the EU experience is that a common identity is fully compatible with respect for the cultural and religious traditions of the constituent peoples. The committee therefore considers that, in the context of EU assistance – which, after the reconstruction phase, has focused on facilitating the adoption of EU standards and laws – increasing attention should be paid to dealing with the burden of the past, including the issue of persons who went missing during the bloody conflict, and promoting an inclusive, non-discriminatory education system in BiH, based on tolerance and respect for diversity.
Finance
The report calls on the Commission to devolve sufficient funds, under the new Pre-Accession Instrument, to both of the abovementioned objectives, not least by providing support to the International Commission on Missing Persons, and urges the Council, via its EU Special Representative, to promote initiatives in this area. The committee is of the opinion that the current education system can represent a serious threat to the security of the country.
MEPs in the committee are also of the opinion that, when the Office of the High Representative eventually closes down, the EU must provide strong and coordinated support to help BiH to achieve its long-term aim of European integration as quickly and thoroughly as possible.

Agreements with Central America and Andean Community
2007-03-07 - 18:50
The plenary will be asked to approve two proposals by the Foreign Affairs Committee for recommendations to the Council on the negotiating mandates for association agreements between the EU and the countries of Central America and between the EU and the Andean Community. MEPs stress that the agreements must take a broad view, covering not just trade but also democracy, human rights, social issues, development and the environment. Central America
In the first report, by Willy Meyer Pleite (GUE/NGL, ES), the Foreign Affairs Committee stresses the need for the agreement to be "a political and economic partnership with the region and its various countries which takes into account the asymmetry and inequalities between the two regions and amongst the various Central American countries, and which therefore includes key provisions on cooperation, development and social cohesion".
A democracy clause must be included in the mandate, together with "mechanisms to safeguard the continuity of the system of employment and environmental incentives under the scheme of generalised preferences" including the GSP Plus scheme, by means of clauses of a social or environmental nature.
To ensure that the democracy clause and other social or environmental clauses are more than just an expression of good intentions, the negotiating guidelines should "refer specifically to the practical means which will enable such clauses to be invoked and should provide for an annual report to be submitted to the European Parliament on the Commission’s monitoring activities in this area".
Lastly, says the committee, the mandate should not include any express or tacit subordination making conclusion of the future EU – Central America Agreement conditional on prior completion of the round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Andean Community
In the report by Luís Yañez-Barnuevo García ( PES, ES) on the EU-Andean Community accord, the Foreign Affairs Committee emphasises the importance of clearly identifying in the mandate the central issues on which the agreement's political dialogue must focus: governability and democratic stabilisation; corruption, impunity, terrorism, narcoterrorism and its links to organised crime; peacekeeping and security; conflict management; poverty, social cohesion and migration. The mandate should also cover the EU-Andean Community agreement on shared responsibility for fighting drug trafficking.
As in the case of the accord with Central America, not only must the ‘democracy clause’, other social clauses and environmental clauses be included; the mandate must also refer explicitly to the specific mechanisms which ensure that they are applied.
Here too, there must be no question of making the conclusion of the EU-Andean Community agreement subject to prior completion of the WTO round negotiations.
Lastly, the specific features of the Andean region must be taken into account, starting from the premise that the training of human resources is a priority for overcoming poverty in the region. Thus, special attention must be given to education, research, science and technology, culture, public health and protection of ecosystems and biodiversity.

Brutal attack on political activist in Russia: Commission statement
2007-03-07 - 18:50
The Commission will make a statement regarding the attack on 25 January this year on Galina Kozlova, a member of the Mari ethnic minority in Russia. Mrs Kozlova is a member of the board of the Mari national organization Mari Ushem (Mari Union) and editor of the magazine Ontsöko. In the evening of January 25 she was attacked, sprayed with nerve gas and severely beaten in Yoshkar-Ola, capital of the Autonomous Republic of Mari El. She believes the attack was politically motivated, her husband having been attacked two years previously.
The Autonomous Republic of Mari El is located some 800 kilometres east of Moscow on both sides of the river Volga in the Russian Federation. The Mari people are a group within the Volga branch of the Finno-Ugrian peoples. Their language, Mari, is spoken by more than 600,000 people.
In February 2006 the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights (IHF) and the Moscow Helsinki Group (MHG) issued a report on the human rights situation of the Mari minority. The report says democracy and freedom of expression have come under growing attack over the last few years. Commisson statement

Security and defence
Non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament
2007-03-07 - 18:50
MEPs will debate the topic of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament after hearing statements from the Council and the Commission, the House will also vote on a resolution on this subject. The EU handles non proliferation and disarmament of WMD at three levels :
During political dialogue with third countries, the issue is frequently raised and the EU standpoint, first discussed and agreed upon between the Member States, is recalled and explained.
At Community level the proliferation risks are duly taken into account. The safeguards systems implemented within the EU, the commitments of the Member states in the different international non-proliferation regimes (Australia group, Missile Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Supplier’s Group, Wassenaar, Zangger), and specific regulations, like the Council regulation setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology, are important contributions to the global non-proliferation regime,
Finally, assistance programmes are designed and implemented, in particular with Russia and other Newly Independent States and North Korea, to reinforce non-proliferation or support the realisation of disarmament projects. These programmes are financed from different Community Budget sources and managed by the Commission. Council and Commission statements - Non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament

Regional policy
Islands and natural and economic constraints
2007-03-07 - 18:50
The Commission should consider allowing state aid to be granted to island regions "where fuel and energy costs clearly adversely affect the competitiveness of the communities living on them" says an own-initiative report by Francesco MUSOTTO (EPP-ED, IT) for the EP Regional Development Committee. State aid for single market access
Given that fuel cost fluctuations can make transportation between island regions and mainland Europe "significantly more burdensome", the European Commission's next regional state aid guidelines should include a "regime allowing operating aids", says the report, which the Committee endorsed by 41 votes in favour, 1 against and 1 abstention.
State aid policy needs to be implemented more flexibly, notably as regards transport links such as sea and air ports, so as to give islands access to the single market on equal terms with mainland regions, adds the report, which also calls on the Commission to think about how the "market investor" (state aid eligibility) test could be adjusted to reflect the realities of life on islands that may lack such investors.
Ultraperipheral, or just insular?
Whereas measures to assist the EU's outermost, "ultraperipheral" regions have a strong legal basis in EC Treaty Article 299, the equivalent rules for islands (EC Treaty Article 158 and the Amsterdam Treaty Declaration on Islands), "have never been the subject of implementing provisions", notes the report.
Sustainable development
The report encourages island communities to use the EU financial and management facilities JASPERS and JEREMIE in order to foster the growth of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as part of a drive to diversify island economies and promote sustainable development. It also calls on the Commission to carry out a cross-sectoral study of opportunities to support sustainable tourism within the regional strategies of islands that are far from centres of population.
Data for policymakers
To help policymakers to take account of islands' special characteristics, the report urges EU Member States to establish specific mechanisms for gathering and sending local data to the European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON). It calls on the Commission to update the island statistics last gathered in 2003, to define new statistical indicators better suited to measuring economic development, and to report on them regularly, including "best practice" examples.
The report also asks the Commission to set up, within the Directorate-General for Regional Policy, an administrative unit for the islands, like the outermost regions unit, to ensure that policy developers take systematic account of the special needs of islands and their permanent and seasonal populations.

Economic and monetary affairs
Prudential assessment of bank takeovers
2007-03-07 - 18:50
Parliament is to consider changes to the European rules on how banking mergers are approved, when a first-reading report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee is put to the vote. The report proposes over a hundred amendments to the Commission’s plans to modify procedural rules and evaluation criteria for the prudential assessment of acquisitions or increased shareholdings in the financial sector. When a bank or similar financial institution changes ownership, more is at stake than the usual competition issues considered for any takeover or merger: the relevant financial supervisory authority also needs to consider whether the new ownership would have implications for the bank’s financial stability. Amid concern that these approval processes were sometimes acting as a barrier to cross-border mergers and acquisitions, the Commission has proposed to tighten up the European rules on the procedures followed by financial authorities with a view to greater clarity and legal certainty.
In a report drawn up by Wolf KLINZ (ALDE, DE), MEPs in the committee propose amendments to a number of key areas:
where the Commission proposed that supervisory authorities should take their decision within 30 working days of being notified of a proposed acquisition, the committee voted for a time limit of 47 working days (or 77 as opposed to 50 for non-EU acquirers);
supervisory authorities should have 10 working days in which to request further information from the company concerned, rather than the 5 days proposed by the Commission;
it should be clearly stated that national authorities may not apply more stringent criteria than those set out in the directives, and that assessment of the reputation of the acquirer should be facilitated by it being a business regulated within the EU;
it is made clear that the authorities should publish their reasons for opposing or authorising an acquisition.
The Commission originally proposed that it should be able to request the supervisory authorities for the documents on which their decision is based. MEPs in the committee are proposing an amendment to insist that the Commission adopt the more usual route of requesting information from the Member State concerned, in order to assess, in necessary, whether the directive is being correctly applied.
Other amendments adopted in committee concern the detailed rules on the extent to which the obligation to refer a proposed acquisition applies to investment management companies.
The report was adopted in committee with the support of the EPP-ED and ALDE groups, but the Socialist group MEPs abstained. It is likely that further amendments will be tabled directly to the plenary session.

Social policy
Children provision: any progress?
2007-03-07 - 18:50
The impact of childcare availability on the participation of women in the labour market is another topic on this week's agenda which has a bearing on the the economic issues at the Brussels European Council of 8-9 March. MEPs will debate the subject with the Council and Commission, with particular reference to a commitment made at a summit five years ago. At the Barcelona "spring summit" of March 2002, EU leaders adopted a range of conclusions on economic policy, including - under the heading "A reinforced employment strategy" - a statement on childcare: "Member States should remove disincentives to female labour force participation and strive, taking into account the demand for childcare facilities and in line with national patterns of provision, to provide childcare by 2010 to at least 90% of children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age and at least 33% of children under 3 years of age" . MEPs will expect to hear from the Council and Commission what progress has been made on this front.

Development and cooperation
Local authorities "under-estimated and under exploited" in development process
2007-03-07 - 18:50
Local authorities in developing countries should be given a much broader and more powerful role in the process of managing aid from European funds, according to a report being put forward by the Committee on Development. The report, drafted by Pierre SCHAPIRA (PES, FR), says that the role of local authorities in development has "so far been under-estimated and under-exploited", due to a lack of sufficient political dialogue on the allocation of EU aid. The committee emphasises the need for "direct, appropriate funding", stating that local authorities should be involved in "each phase of the cooperation process".
Lack of genuine involvement
The importance of involving local authorities in the cooperation process, through effective political dialogue, was acknowledged in the Cotonou Agreement (2000). Yet despite clear guidelines set out by the European Commission, the report finds that "local authorities in developing countries have only been involved in the implementation of projects and not in the elaboration of development policies".
Part of the problem concerns the lack of a clearly defined role for local authorities in the development process. Local authorities should be identified separately from non-State actors, and consideration should be given to "their sphere of competence, legitimacy and democratic control, experience in management of local affairs and involvement in the implementation of public policies".
The report adds that local authorities have "added value in terms of implementing sectoral programmes", such as those involving health, education and essential public services, but are at present "often excluded from this process."
Decentralisation and local authority action
The focus of EU aid should be decentralisation, the report suggests, and that this aid should be transferred directly to local authorities. The committee also emphasises that recognising and harnessing local authority action are issues which should inform the revision of the coming development instruments in 2008/2009.
Furthermore, the committee calls for the creation of an international monitoring centre for local democracy and decentralisation, in partnership with local authority organisations, in order to enable and regulate the measures which will allow local authorities to play a much more significant role in the development process.

Fundamental rights
Ensuring EU laws comply with fundamental rights
2007-03-07 - 18:50
The House will vote on an own-initiative report by the Civil Liberties Committee drafted in response to the Commission's plans for ensuring that EU legislation is compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The committee is stressing the need to make the Charter legally binding. In March 2001, the Commission decided that any proposal for legislation to be adopted would, as part of the normal decision-making procedures, first be scrutinised for compatibility with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Charter was proclaimed by the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and Commission on 7 December 2000 but is not yet legally binding.
In 2005 the Commission published a communication aimed at drafting a methodology to ensure "systematic and rigorous monitoring" of the compliance with fundamental rights on its proposals.
A genuine rights culture needed, say MEPs
In Johannes VOGGENHUBER 's (Greens/EFA, AT) report, MEPs highlight the need to promote a "genuine fundamental rights culture in the Union" which "consists not only of passive compliance with the rules, but also of active promotion of fundamental rights and intervention in cases of violation or unsatisfactory protection of fundamental rights by the Member States".
They insist on the need to monitor compliance with fundamental rights particularly in the area on freedom, security and justice. As examples of problems, they point to the "existence of secret prisons and the illegal kidnappings by the CIA" and the "dilatory investigation and lack of cooperation on the part of several governments" as well as the transfer of airline passenger data and bank account data by SWIFT.
In particular, the Civil Liberties Committee stresses the need to overcome the crisis in the constitution process, to preserve the central achievements of the constitution, and to establish the Charter of Fundamental Rights as legally binding. It then makes a number of practical recommendations for tightening up the proposed monitoring procedure and implementing it within the EU institutions.
