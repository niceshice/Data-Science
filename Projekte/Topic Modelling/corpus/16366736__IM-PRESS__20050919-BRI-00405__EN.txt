Briefing, 26-29 September 2005 - Strasbourg
2005-09-23 - 09:49
The second Strasbourg session of September sees a busy agenda for MEPs. Parliament will officially welcome Observers from Bulgaria and Romania. The 35 Romanians and 18 Bulgarians will be able to participate in parliamentary committee meetings but not vote or address the plenary. Both countries are expected to join the EU 1 January 2007.
On Monday evening, before Parliament begins to tackle its legislative work, President Josep Borrell will make a statement on the future of Europe. This will be followed by reaction from the political group leaders. The issue of the Commission's decision to withdraw legislative proposals is also likely to be raised. President Borrell will also hold a press conference in Strasbourg on Tuesday 27 September at 12.15.
On Monday, MEPs will debate the 25th anniversary of Solidarity (Solidarnosc) and its message for Europe. The subsequent resolution is expected to call for 31 August to be marked as Liberty and Solidarity Day.
On Tuesday, the plenary session opens with the debate on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status. Parliament will vote on the question of data retention for the purpose of combating crime, including terrorism. The Civil Liberties Committee is recommending rejection of the initiative on data retention as sizeable doubts remain on the choice of the legal basis and the proportionality of the measures. France, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden submitted the proposal on data retention. Also on Tuesday, MEPs will debate the legislative package on how to improve the EU's railways (known as the third railway package). The Transport Committee wants international passenger services to be opened up to competition by 1 January 2008 and national passenger services by 1 January 2012.
On Wednesday, Parliament will discuss the controversial issue of the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey which was a feature of the recent German election campaign. Also on Wednesday, the Commission and Council will make statements on oil dependency and oil prices, reform of the UN and on Belarus. The House is set to adopt resolutions on all of these matters. MEPs will also debate EU-India relations. The Foreign Affairs Committee is backing a new strategic partnership and calls for extra funding for its implementation.
Ari VATANEN (EPP-ED, FR), a former World Rally Car Champion, will lead the debate on the important issue of how to reduce the number of road accident victims in the EU. The own-initiative report aims at improving and strengthening the proposal, in particular with regard to young road users and their education, vulnerable road users and the introduction of cost-effective intelligent safety systems.
Thursday opens with a Commission Statement on the textile industry given the recent EU agreement with China. Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, UK) will present her report on prospects for trade relations between the EU and China. The session will end as usual with three debates and resolutions on human rights in the world (see below).
Changes to the agenda
Parliament's Conference of Presidents met on Thursday 22 September and adopted the final draft agenda for the September II session with a number of changes to the previous version. These are as follows:
The report from Bert Doorn (EPP-ED, NL) on statutory audit of annual accounts will now be debated on Monday evening. The second item on Tuesday morning will now be a statement from the Commission on the EU/USA agreement on wine production.
Votes without debate on Tuesday will now also include a report from Stefano Zappalà (EPP-ED, IT) on public tendering procedures and from Klaus-Heiner Lehne (EPP-ED, DE) on the request for the lifting of Marios Matzakis's parliamentary immunity, along with the final vote on the report by Alexander Nuno Alvaro (ALDE, DE) on communications data retention.
The reports from Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK) on the European Payment Order, by Paolo Costa (ALDE, IT) on the EC/Azerbaijan air services agreement and by Johan Van Hecke (ALDE, BE) on the production of pharmaceuticals for countries facing serious health problems have all been postponed to a future session.
The regular human rights debates at the end of the session will deal with Nepal, Uzbekistan and Tunisia.

Basel II directives reach plenary
2005-09-23 - 09:49
MEPs are to vote on the draft directives aiming to update EU law in parallel with the Basel II agreement on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions. Alexander RADWAN (EPP-ED, DE) is presenting a report on behalf of Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. Broad agreement was reached between the main political groups at committee stage with a series of compromises adopted, which also reflected the rapporteur's discussions with the Council and Commission. This should make it possible for the legislation to be adopted at first reading and enter force this year - though agreement on " comitology " has still to be reached. The overall aim is to make the capital requirements more risk sensitive, better to reflect the complexity of today's financial markets.
The committee is proposing over 500 amendments to the Commission's draft directives. While many of these are simply aimed at tidying up the text, there are also substantial changes, with agreement reached in committee on issues such as the conditions for applying capital requirements on a consolidated, cross border basis to groups with subsidiaries in various EU countries, how to deal with internal group lending, as well as banks taking part in an institutional protection scheme and on minimum data retention requirements.
The main outstanding issue is " comitology " - the system which grants the Commission authority to decide on the detailed implementation of an EU law. The proposed constitution would have given Parliament an explicit right to revoke such implementing decision, but with the prospects for the constitution in doubt, the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee is proposing that implementing powers under these directives should come into force only once and interinstitutional agreement has been reached clarifying Parliament's right of " call back ." Discussions with the Commission and Council are continuing on this point at the time of writing. MEPs in the committee also want to insist that the Commission review the legislation four years after it comes into force.
The International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: a Revised Framework, or the ”Basel II Framework,” offers a new set of standards for establishing minimum capital requirements for banking organisations. It was presented in June 2004 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a group of central banks and bank supervisory authorities in the G10 countries, which developed the first standard in 1988. Rapporteur Alexander Radwan EPP-ED DE A6-0257/2005 1. on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council re-casting Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions
(COM(2004)0486 – C6‑0141/2004 – 2004/0155(COD))
and
2. on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council recasting Council Directive 93/6/EEC of 15 March 1993 on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions.
(COM(2004)0486 – C6‑0144/2004 – 2004/0159(COD)) Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Minimum EU standards for granting refugee status
2005-09-23 - 09:49
The Civil Liberties Committee called is calling for stricter minimum standards in the EU Member States for granting or refusing refugee status. MEPs in the committee are proposing over a hundred amendments to a Commission draft directive with the aim of anchoring refugees' rights more firmly. They stress that the directive must respect the Geneva Convention at all stages. The main point at issue between the committee and the Council (whose position is already known as it has been agreed by national governments) is the concept of " super safe countries ", by which EU states would be allowed to draw up a list of third countries which are deemed definitely safe so they can deny refugee status to all applicants from these countries. MEPs in the committee reject this provision, saying it is unfair to citizens of those countries as is does not require an individual assessment and goes against the Geneva Convention's " non-refoulement " principle (by which governments may not turn refugees away without hearing their case).
Another proposal disliked by MEPs in the committee is the idea of allowing each Member State to create a national list of " safe third countries " to which it can send back a refugee if his/her country of origin is on the list and is willing to take the individual back. MEPs in the committee propose amending this to give applicants the right to " rebut the presumption of safety ". Any assessment of how serious the risk of living in the country of origin is and whether a person deserves refugee status should always be conducted on an individual basis, rather than on a general presumption concerning the country in question, say MEPs in the committee. In addition, there should be only one common EU list of " safe third countries ", which could be revised by the European Parliament and the Council if necessary.
The Civil Liberties Committee recommends approving the idea of allowing "a fast-track procedure " to deal with refugee applicants. However it wishes to limit strictly the conditions under which a country can use this instrument to speed up a refusal of refugee status. This should be allowed only when the applications are " clearly fraudulent or manifestly unfounded ", as rapporteur Wolfgang KREISSL-DÖRFLER (PES, DE) explained.
Finally, in further proposed amendments, MEPs in the committee say the rights of potential refugees must be fully respected at all stages of the application procedure. They must have the right to appeal if refused, and must always be allowed to stay in the Member State until the appeal procedure ends. Applicants should also be entitled to request a personal interview with the authorities, to be legally represented and to receive full information about the procedure in a language they understand. Cases of " inadmissible applications " can be evaluated by a Member State only in accordance with the Geneva Convention. When dealing with refugees, the rights of children under 18 - even if married - must always take priority.
As this legislation comes under the consultation procedure, Parliament's amendments are not binding on the Council. However, after it is adopted Parliament will have co-decision powers with the Council on refugee and asylum measures. Rapporteur Wolfgang Kreissl-Dörfler PES DE A6-0222/2005 Report on the amended proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status Procedure : Consultation

Retention of Data on public communication networks - set to be rejected
2005-09-23 - 09:49
Mr Alvaro for the Civil Liberties Committee will be recommending that Parliament reject a proposal from four countries on the retention of data processed by telephone and internet providers for the purpose of prevention, investigation and prosecution of terrorist acts. . Parliament already debated the topic on the 7 June in its plenary session and voted to send back the issue to the Civil Liberties Committee for further discussion. There will be no formal debate on this subject. It will be voted on Tuesday.
France, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden submitted a joint proposal for a framework decision on the retention of communications data. The aim of the proposal is to facilitate judicial cooperation in criminal matters by approximating Member States' legislation on the retention of data processed and stored by providers of a publicly available electronic communications service. This would cover traffic and location data generated by telephony, SMS and Internet protocols, but would not apply to the content of the information communicated. The proposal provides for data to be retained in principle for a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 36 months.
In the non-binding report, the Committee recommends rejecting the proposal as sizable doubts remain on the choice of the legal basis and the proportionality of the measures. The report from the committee demands the Member States produce a study proving the "unquestionable need" for the proposed data retention arrangements. It furthermore suggests verifying whether the decision's objectives might be achieved by implementing the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime.
Mr Alvaro is now likely to table amendments to plenary advising MEPs to reject the proposal in order to wait for the new Commission proposal on data retention which is due be published later this month and will imply co-decision powers for the European Parliament. Nevertheless, the UK Presidency of the EU has already expressed its firm support for this initiative and will try to push it through during its mandate. Rapporteur Alexander Nuno Alvaro ALDE DE A6-174/05 Retention of data on public communications networks, for the purpose of combating crime, including terrorism. Procedure: Consultation
Vote: 27.09.2005 Debate on the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of crime and criminal offences including terrorism.

Trade with China
2005-09-23 - 09:49
MEPs are to debate a call for rapid action by China to address the many concerns of EU industry, especially Intellectual Property Rights enforcements, national treatment, transparency and environmental, social and health standards. This comes in a report drawn up by Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, UK) for the International Trade Committee. While welcoming China's implementation of some of its WTO obligations, the committee wants the Commission to offer effective backing to European companies regarding the "numerous cases of inadequate implementation or application by China" of other WTO obligations. MEPs in the committee are calling for measures to protect the intellectual property of EU firms. They call on China not to put up bureaucratic barriers to trade, and to award public contracts in a transparent and fair manner.
The committee welcomes the Commission's Memorandum of Understanding with China limiting textile exports but is concerned at the disruption caused to European retailers by the way it has been implemented. Looking ahead, it says the challenges currently being faced by the textile, clothing and footwear sectors will soon be experiences by others, such as the bicycle, automobile and iron and steel industries, and that these are systemic in nature, requiring a longer term strategy for the EU's international trade policy. MEPs in the committee not that relocations to China primarily affect the most vulnerable and least qualified workers, and call for "strong social solidarity to be shown with these workers" notably through support for training and retraining.
The report notes China's success in extricating over 300 million people from poverty over the last 20 years, but states MEPs' concern at the continuing extreme poverty facing a quarter of China's rural population. Noting with concern the lack of workers' rights in China, notably inadequate health and safety rules, the report calls for China to permit independent trades unions to be established, and for swift action against the use of child labour and forced labour.
MEPs in the committee express their serious concern at the high levels of pollution caused by China's industries and the growing consumption of natural resources such as timber from unsustainable sources. They urge the Chinese government to play a full and positive role in promoting sustainable development , while welcoming recent signs that China is taking serious measures to protect the environment.
The report calls for the EU to carry on a more intensive political dialogue with China, ranging from human rights matters to regional and global security issues. It calls for the establishment of a clear and effective policy of human rights conditionality with regard to the EU's general trading policy with China.

MEPs keen to strengthen cooperation with India
2005-09-23 - 09:49
The Foreign Affairs Committee is calling for far greater cooperation between the EU and India in a non-binding report by Emilio MENÉNDEZ DE VALLE (PES, ES). MEPs in the committee champion a proposal by the Commission for a new strategic partnership and are calling for extra funding for its implementation. MEPs in the committee note that the USA has aspirations for a strategic alliance with India and that China and India are also expanding their relations. They make a number of specific recommendations to strengthen the ties with India, but also raise a number of issues of concern.
The report calls on the EU and India to jointly tackle aspects of industrial, environmental and development cooperation, trade, investment and good governance. It voices alarm at UNICEF reports that seventeen and a half million children are working in India, " mostly in subhuman conditions ". More generally, MEPs in the committee urge India to update its labour laws to prevent the exploitation of workers. The EU should work together with the Indian government to improve the situation of underprivileged people, in particular women, children and disadvantaged groups, e.g. Dalits and Adivasis.
Another cause for concern is the increasing environmental destruction and MEPs in the committee urge India to show greater sensitivity to the question of global warming, while pursuing its development needs. The " alarming drop in the number of tigers " merits special mention. The resolution notes that twenty years after the Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal, the site has still not been cleaned up and calls on the Indian authorities and on Dow Chemicals to clean up the toxic waste immediately. MEPs in the committee also urge India to allow derogations to the ban on the manufacture of generic drugs for medicines such as those against AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis and cancer.
The committee recommends systematic EU-India consultation in advance of international meetings or conferences and establishing permanent links to secure " balanced and mutually beneficial progress on the main points of the Doha Develoment Agenda ". The committee also calls on the Indian government to take firm action against the dumping of trade goods on the EU.

Transport
Community railways
2005-09-23 - 09:49
Parliament will debate and vote on the following four reports (the third railway package) relating to the rail sector in the EU.
- Contractual quality requirements for rail freight services
- Development of the Community's railways
- International rail passengers' rights and obligations
- Certification of train crews Rail freight compensation system - Transport Committee recommends rejection
The Transport Committee is recommending giving the thumbs down to Commission plans that would require rail freight operators to pay compensation if they fail to meet punctuality and reliability standards for goods deliveries. The committee argues that they would increase costs for rail freight services and distort competition with road transport.
The plans, which form part of the third railway package, are designed to encourage freight to move from road to rail. The Commission wants to make mandatory compensation a feature of contracts negotiated between rail operators and their freight customers.
However, in a legislative report by Roberts ZILE (UEN, LV), MEPs in the committee say that a compensation system would not improve standards in the industry and existing international legislation was already imposing strict enough rules on rail, far more than equivalent regulations on road transport. Rather than imposing more regulations and fines, the emphasis should be on easier market access for new rail companies so as to increase competitiveness. Better railway infrastructure is also needed.
More competition for passenger services
More competition on rail networks in order to improve services is a long-standing demand of Parliament and one that lies at the heart of the second directive in the package, on the development of the Community's railways. Here the Transport Committee has more bad news for Commission in a legislative report by Georg JARZEMBOWSKI (EPP-ED, DE).
MEPs in the committee are proposing an amendment demanding that national passenger services be covered by the legislation - and not just international ones as the Commission wanted. They want international passenger services to be opened up to competition by 1 January 2008 and national passenger services by 1 January 2012. The Commission had proposed 2010 for international services and did not mention national passenger services. However, the committee is also demanding that Member States be allowed to open up their networks earlier if they so wish.
Passengers' rights
In adopting a report by Dirk STERCKX (ELDR, BE) on passengers' rights and obligations, MEPs in the committee argue that these should apply not only to international rail passengers, but also national ones. The committee proposes the following minimum compensation to be paid to passengers for delays:
- 25% of the fare for a delay of 60 minutes or more;
- 50% for a delay of 120 minutes or more;
- 75% for a delay of 180 minutes and more.
This compensation should be paid no later than one month after the application has been made.
The committee also calls for passengers who hold a season ticket and encounter repeated delays or cancellations to receive compensation in the form of free journeys, price reductions or an extension of the period of validity of a season ticket.
Train crews
Gilles SAVARY (PES, FR) will be reporting on a less controversial part of this rail package: a system of certificates for train crews to show they meet professional, medical and linguistic standards. The Transport Committee wants to simplify the Commission's timetable for introducing these requirements. It believes they should apply to an initial category of drivers from 1 January 2007, namely those working across borders. Other crew members would require certificates from 1 January 2009.
Lastly, the committee decided that these four reports should not be put to the vote in plenary " until it has been ensured that the Council is going to deal with all four proposals and, moreover, is willing to submit a Common Position on the revision of Regulation 1191/69 on public service requirements ".

EU action programme to improve road safety
2005-09-23 - 09:49
Cross-border enforcement of road traffic law remains very unsatisfactory, says the Transport Committee. It therefore argues that the time is ripe for a Community-wide approach to enable authorities to follow up offences and penalties imposed in another Member State. The committee also feels that enforcing compliance with existing road traffic rules would dramatically improve road safety as most accidents are the results of a failure to comply with traffic rules. The Transport Committee, through an own-initiative report by Ari VATANEN (EPP-ED, FR), is backing the Commission proposal on a European road safety programme, which bears the title " Halving the number of road accident victims in the EU by 2010: a shared responsibility ".
MEPs in the committee are proposing a range of amendments aiming at improving and strengthening the proposal, in particular with regard to young road users and their education, vulnerable road users and the introduction of cost-effective intelligent safety systems. The committee also strongly urges the Commission to introduce a harmonised definition of Community road signs and motorist information.
The committee expresses concern about the safety of vulnerable road users, including young people, noting that the risk of death in motorcycle or moped travel was 17 times higher than in car travel and that walking or cycling was up to nine times riskier. Finally, it regrets that the Third Road Safety Action Programme did not particularly highlight the road safety problems in densely populated areas, where most accidents happen.
The Transport Committee also stresses the aspect of subsidiarity and responsibility of Member States; particularly where it comes to the implementation and enforcement of existing legislation. It also underlines that the EU's role should be to coordinate awareness campaigns, research programmes and exchange of best practice and information between Member States. Other aspects of the report include the need to upgrade and raise standards of road design and planning. Finally, the non-binding report points out the huge importance and scope of improvements gained from new technologies like seat-belt reminders, electronic stability control and speed limitation systems.
During the debate in committee Mr Vatanen, a former Word Rally Car Champion, quoted economist John Maynard Keynes, who once said " In the long run we are all dead " but, he added, that this would not necessarily have to be on EU roads if the Commission and Member States would adopt the conclusions in his report.

Enlargement
Turkey and the EU
2005-09-23 - 09:49
MEPs will hear statements from the Council and Commission on the question of opening negotiations on EU membership with Turkey. At the same time, they will consider a report from Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE) for the Foreign Affairs Committee on the expansion of the EU's association agreement with Turkey to include the 10 new Member States who joined the EU last year. In both cases, the issue of Turkey's recognition of Cyprus is a key question. While Turkey accepted that Cyprus would participate in the association agreement, it issued a declaration that this did not amount to recognising the Cypriot government. EU ministers have been working on a response since then. They have now agreed a counter-declaration, stating that Turkey must recognise the government of Cyprus during the accession before joining the EU, though indicating that this need not block the opening of negotiations. MEPs will now have their say.
The protocol to the association agreement can only come into force if Parliament gives its assent, by a simple majority. There will also be a vote on the general issue of Turkey's potential accession to the EU, this time on a resolution drawn up by the political groups.
The European Commission will issue its report on Turkey's progress to accession on 9 November. Parliament will draw up its own report in response - the rapporteur will be Camiel EURLINGS (EPP-ED, NL).

Members ask for mandatory EU target for renewable energies - 25% is feasible
2005-09-23 - 09:49
Stressing the 21st century as the "renewable energies – renewable century", Claude Turmes (Greens/EFA, LU) for Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy will be putting forward an own initiative report on the share of renewable energy in the EU and proposals for specific action. The non-binding report gives a strategic overview of renewable energy policy in Europe. MEPs in the committee underline that last year the European Parliament called for a 20 per cent target for renewable energies in overall energy consumption in the EU by 2020. New studies show that a target of at least 25 per cent is feasible. This figure would set the EU as a world leader in renewable energies. The Commission is asked to draw up an EU medium-term renewable energy strategy for the period after 2010. Mandatory targets should be set, say MEPs in the committee, and the EU targets should be broken down into both sector and national targets.
MEPs in the committee emphasise that renewable energies, along with energy efficiency and conservation, not only reduce health and environmental degradation and ensure sustainable development but also contribute to innovation and to regional as well as national development and fair trade, and create jobs in line with the Lisbon-strategy. They call for tax cuts as incentives for promoting renewable energies as well as for fair and free access to the grid and non-discriminatory tariffs, which currently prevent the development of renewable sources of electricity in several Member States.
Furthermore, MEPs in the committee call on the Commission to come up with new legislative initiatives in order to put an end to huge market distortions which penalise renewable energy production. The committee points to insufficient ownership unbundling requirements, ineffective wholesale markets, increased market concentration and subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power as market obstacles for renewable sources of energy.
MEPs in the committee are also suggesting a number of proposals concerning the use of biomass which they consider has many advantages compared to conventional energy sources and other renewable energy sources. The Commission and Member States are asked to use the structural and cohesion funds to promote the use of biomass. Member States should also examine their tax systems and abolish all unnecessary tax burdens for users of biomass, says the committee.
Finally, in order to finance specific programmes, MEPs in the committee suggest that the upcoming Seventh Framework Programme for research on technological development and health (FP7), must include " increased funding for renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency ".

Territorial Cohesion and Regional Development
2005-09-23 - 09:49
Ambroise Guellec (EPP-ED, FR) for the Regional Development Committee will be putting forward a draft-own initiative report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development. The report calls for regional development to be founded on programmes which guarantee equality of treatment between the EU’s territories, while preserving their diversity. This implies that, says the committee, appropriate measures be taken to ensure accessibility of services of general interest (SGI) and services of general economic interest (SGEI).
The committee also wants, with a view to measuring regional development and evaluating it objectively, the adoption, alongside GDP figures, of new territorial indicators, namely " the decentralisation and accessibility index, infrastructure and transport provision, research/ innovation, education and training activity, level of diversification of productivity in the area, and unemployment rate ."

Regional policy
Support for Europe's outermost regions
2005-09-23 - 09:49
Sérgio Marques (EPP-ED, PT) for the Regional Development Committee will be putting forward a draft own-initiative report on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions. This overarching report calls for support for the outermost regions namely Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Reunion, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. The report calls on the Commission to continue to apply specific tax measures for the benefit of the outermost regions and show willingness to propose other arrangements to promote their self-contained development. The Regional Development Committee strongly also supports the special action of €1 100 million for the outermost regions proposed by the Commission.
On sugar, the report deplores the abolition of sales aid for the sugar sector and calls for the restoration of this instrument and full compensation for loss of income in order genuinely to take account of the specific handicaps suffered by the outermost regions. The report says that " it is essential to ensure that sugar production and refining in the Azores are given access to the national market under conditions equivalent to those prevailing before their incorporation into the European Union, in the same way as the Canary islands, since otherwise it will no longer be viable for the industry to continue in the region".
As for transport and energy links, the committee calls on the Commission, to treat projects in outermost regions as a priority and make them subject to the co-financing rate laid down for projects deemed to have priority.
Outermost regions should also be supported as regards state-aid says the committee, the report calls for compensation to be authorised for the outermost regions for the additional costs arising from the transport of goods, within the EU market rather than only within the national borders of the country concerned.
The report comes in response to the Commission communications of 26 May 2004, entitled " A stronger partnership for the outermost regions " and 23 August 2004 on a " stronger partnership strengthened for the outermost regions: assessment and prospects ". The report, in general, calls for support for the outermost regions in the following areas: agriculture, fisheries, competition and state aids, enterprise policy, services of general interest and services of general economic interest, taxation, customs measures, environment, energy, research and technological development, vocational training, transport, trans-European networks, new information and communication technologies and regional cooperation.

Fisheries
EEC-Fishing Agreement with Comoros
2005-09-23 - 09:49
Carmen Fraga Estévez (EPP-ED, ES) for the Fisheries Committee will be tabling a non-binding resolution on the EEC-Comoros fishing agreement. The purpose of the agreement is to conclude a new Protocol setting out the tuna fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for on fishing off the Comoros for the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010. The fisheries committee recommends approving the proposal under the consultation procedure, subject to a few amendments. These reflect Parliament's traditional position on renewing fishing agreements, namely, that a general assessment report on the application of the agreement should be presented by the Commission before the beginning of negotiations. Only after the report had been received and Parliament has given its opinion thereon should the Council authorise the Commission to enter into negotiations for a possible new Protocol.
In view of the financial and social importance of targeted measures, the multi-annual sectoral programme which the Comorian authorities are to draw up as a framework for those measures should be forwarded to Parliament and Council as well as being sent to the Commission, say the committee. Lastly, the committee wants provision to be made for ship-owners to send representatives to attend meetings of the Joint Committee set up under the Agreement. MEPs in the committee argue that ship-owners are meeting a significant part of the costs of the agreement and should be given a say and a minimum degree of legal certainty enabling them to continue to protect the interests of their businesses.

Industry
No to compulsory audit committees?
2005-09-23 - 09:49
MEPs are to debate the proposals aimed at increasing the quality of auditing and public trust in the system, drawn up by the Commission in the light of recent financial and auditing scandals. The legislation sets out to clarify the duties and ethics of statutory auditors and audit firms. It would also set up a system of public oversight and aim to enhance cooperation between the relevant authorities in the Member States. In a first reading report drawn up by Bert DOORN (EPP-ED, NL), the Legal Affairs Committee is proposing a number of changes to the draft directive, notably regarding the question of audit committees. The Commission proposed that all publicly listed companies should have a separate audit committee, but Mr Doorn's report says individual Member States should be able to decide whether to apply this rule or whether to allow existing supervisory boards to perform the functions of an audit committee. This would avoid unnecessarily adding to the administrative burdens on businesses.
This more flexible approach has been agreed in informal discussions between Mr Doorn and representatives of Council and Commission - a compromise which should allow the directive to be adopted at first reading.
