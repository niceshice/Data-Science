A targeted EU policy plan is needed to combat violence against women, said the Women's Rights Committee on Wednesday. Male violence against women is a structural and widespread problem, linked to unequal distribution of power between the sexes - it is not a question of age, education, income or social position, it stressed, adding that this violence also violates human rights to life, safety, dignity, physical and mental integrity and sexual and reproductive choice and health.
The committee urged EU Member States “to recognise sexual violence and rape, including within marriage and intimate informal relationships, as a crime" and "to ensure that such offences result in automatic prosecution”.
Its resolution calls for a targeted and coherent EU policy plan to combat all forms of violence against women, as stated in the EU Roadmap for Equality between women and men. The relevant national laws and policies should be improved through the development of comprehensive national action plans, it adds.
Arrangements should also be made to enable female victims of gender-based violence and people-trafficking networks to assert their rights everywhere in the EU, it says.
Member States and the Commission are urged to embark on concerted action, including public awareness and information campaigns on domestic violence and strategies aimed at changing social stereotypes of women through media and education.
For example, any reference to cultural practices or traditions as a mitigating factor in cases of violence against women, "crimes of honour" and female genital mutilation should be rejected it says, noting that female genital mutilation, crimes of honour and forced marriages also happen in the EU.
The motion for a resolution on the Elimination of violence against women was adopted with 17 votes in favour, 4 against and 4 abstentions.
