Rapporteur: Benedict Anthony Martins, MP (South Africa) 08:30 23:59 Hong Kong, China 2005-12-16 Delegations Parliament delegation to observe trial of Turkish author Orhan Pamuk
The European Parliament will send a delegation to observe the trial of Turkish author Orhan Pamuk, starting on 16 December 2005 in Istanbul. The delegation, led by Camiel Eurlings (EPP-ED, NL), the EP rapporteur on Turkey's accession, will verify whether the implementation of Turkey's constitutional reforms meets EU human rights standards.
Mr Pamuk was charged in August 2005 by a public prosecutor in Istanbul for violating Article 301 of the Turkish constitution after an interview he gave to a Swiss newspaper in which he said "thirty thousand Kurds and a million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it". The public prosecutor has indicted Mr Pamuk for insulting the Turkish identity, for which he could face imprisonment for up to three years.
The delegation, which also includes Panagiotis Beglitis (PES, GR), Andrew Duff (ALDE, UK), Feleknas Uca (EUL/NGL, DE) and Geoffrey Van Orden (EPP-ED, UK), will observe the Court proceedings in the same way another European Parliament delegation observed the trial of Sakharov prize winner Leyla Zana and others in 2003 and 2004.
