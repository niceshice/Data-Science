Issues on how can competition stimulate investments into a smart energy system as well as methods to set the right regulatory framework to better use the untapped potential of district heating and cooling networks as well as of enhancing energy performance of buildings will be debated during this joint meeting.
The event will be opened by Jerzy Buzek, President of the European Parliament, Herbert Reul, Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy of the European Parliament, Pál Kovács, Deputy State Secretary for Energy of the Hungarian Government, representing the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Antal Rogán, Chairman of the Economic and Information Technology Committee of the Hungarian National Assembly and Günther Oettinger, European Commissioner for Energy. 14:30 18:00 Brussels, Parliamentary Chamber Draft programme of the meeting Website of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy Watch webstreaming live Catch up via Video On Demand (VOD) Kristina-Antigoni ELEFTERIE Press Officer BXL (+32) 2 28 32798 STR (+33) 3 881 74651 PORT (+32) 498 98 32 83 EMAIL indu-press@europarl.europa.eu 2011-05-25 The President's diary President's agenda
