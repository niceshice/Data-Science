MEPs will assess conditions in the centres
Asylum seekers and detention of immigrants is under the spotlight as MEPs from the Civil Liberties Committee visit detention centres in Demark this week. They will visit the Kongelund and Ellebæk camps Friday to assess conditions. Last year saw the largest influx into Denmark of foreigners with over 37,000 residence permits being granted - the most notable increase being from states that joined the Union after 2004. In terms of asylum seekers by far the largest group is from Iraq.
The April 10-11 visit forms part of a series of visits by the Committee to see for themselves how people are being treated across the continent.
As well as meeting inmates of the camps MEPs will also meet the Danish authorities and NGOs, who have first-hand experience of dealing with asylum and immigration issues.
The European Parliament's role in immigration policy is to give its opinion on the criteria necessary for individuals to be given the status of asylum seekers. EU countries are responsible for organisation of detention centres, but MEPs believe it is useful to compare the differences.
As part of our coverage of immigration issues, we will report on the visit to Demark in a series of articles next week. Read about the delegation's experiences and findings here.
