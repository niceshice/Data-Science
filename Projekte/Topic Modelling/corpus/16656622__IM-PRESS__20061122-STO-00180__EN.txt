Wills and Inheritance: MEPs hope new report holds key
It is hard dealing with the grief following the death of a family member or friend, but when it is compounded by legal arguments in different countries over their last will and testament the experience can turn into a nightmare. With the freedom to live, work and own property around the EU increasing, the number of "international" wills is increasing. It is estimated that up to 100,000 people a year leave something in their will to people or organisations abroad.
As Europeans live longer and grow more prosperous, while EU cooperation makes access to health care and social services in foreign countries easier, - the numbers of people living and retiring abroad is rising.
In their mid-November plenary session, MEPs backed a report that calls on the EU Commission to draw up legal guidelines on the issue. They would take into account current private international law (national laws governing the death of foreigners living there) and make dispute settlement easier for issues involving marriage, divorce, accidents and so on where there are links to other countries.
Simplification is the key
The key element is simplification. MEPs want just one Judge and one Court involved - the latter should be normally be in the country of residence of the deceased.
Freedom of choice is also key. For those writing a will, the report proposes the right to choose which legal system should govern their affairs. For those who are inheriting and are involved in a dispute it favours the option to choose the most appropriate Court.
The report also proposes a "European certificate of inheritance which would indicate which law the will and inheritance fall under. A network of national registers of wills across Europe is also supported to simplify the task of finding a will and determining its content.
"A sensitive and emotional law..."
There is clearly public support for some kind of action. In an EU-wide survey in July 80% of those questioned agreed with the statement that "it is necessary to recognize the last testament wills of the dead within the whole European area".
Speaking during the debate Giuseppe Gargani of the Italian People's Party, who chairs Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee, said, "people enjoy the freedom of movement guaranteed by the EU. But there are serious concerns about the successions of property rights in the case of death. Wills and testament law is a sensitive and emotional law..."
The Commission will hold an open hearing for "all interested parties" on 30 November ahead of the publication of recommendations for legislation in March.
