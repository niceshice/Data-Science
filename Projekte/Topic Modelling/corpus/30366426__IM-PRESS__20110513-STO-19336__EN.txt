Eu domain banner on the Berlaymont building of the European Commission on 1st of December 2005 Â© European Union, 2011 In the beginning there was ".com", then, ".org", ".int" and following the other dots in the web galaxy, ".eu". Five years after its launch, .eu is fast approaching the 3.5 million registration mark. European businesses, organisations and citizens embraced it after it became publically available on 7 April, 2006 and .eu celebrated its 5th birthday last month in Strasbourg during the plenary.
The European institutions were the first to make the switch, changing their domain registrations from .int to .eu but since then, ".eu" has expanded to cover just about every form of human endeavour. In April, .eu's birthday was celebrated during the plenary in the presence of 130 MEPs and, of course, the agency running it, EURid, a common endeavour by the ".be", ".it" and ".se", domains from Belgium, Italy and Sweden.
Over the past five years the use of ".eu" has expanded at a steady pace, with several hundred registrations daily. Germany is the main market and with more than a million registrations in five years, .eu has proved more popular for new sites than the national domain name ".de".
The fastest growth however has been in Estonia, Poland, Slovakia and Lithuania, where .eu is competing with .com to be the second most popular extension after the national top-level domain. In all, ".eu" is now the fourth most popular domain in the EU and the 9th most popular in the world, in a market led by the ubiquitous ".com"
Hope and glory
Initially "there was a lot of scepticism because the question was what added value does it bring on top of national domain names...I think five years on we have proven that it has been efficient, effective and of benefit to business," British Socialist Arlene McCarthy said during the ".eu" birthday party in Strasbourg.
Creativity in action
"Creative" uses of .eu include some Basque webpages, where it is used to refer to the Basque language, Euskara, and some Romanian, Portuguese and Galician personal websites, as eu in those languages is equivalent to the English pronoun "I".
How to register your own .eu domain name?
1. An EU citizen or organisation? Check on Eurid whether the name you want to register is available. The system works on a "first come, first serve" basis.
2. Register the name for up to 10 years with a .eu accredited registrar. There are lots so use the internet or EURid to find one in your country. You have to pay registrars for their service.
3. After this you become the domain holder, meaning that you have a right to trade, transfer or delete your .eu domain name.
