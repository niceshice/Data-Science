The EU is the world's leading wine producer
The highlight of Tuesday's Plenary was the awarding of the 2007 Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought to Sudanese human rights lawyer Salih Mahmoud Osman. MEPs also debated reforming the EU's wine market to bring it into line with changing consumption and backed plans to make it easier for freight trains to move across borders.
"European Union has a great responsibility"
Mr Salih was welcomed by EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering, who said he "is one of the few people who have actively defended women's rights and the right for a compensation for the victims in Darfur". In his speech, Mr Salih urged the EU to play a greater role in the region. He told MEPs that "The European Union has a great responsibility to promote peace internationally. The victims feel disappointed. They are waiting to hear from you; from the people of Europe".
The Sakharov winner also called for greater justice in the region saying that "as a lawyer, and a native of Darfur, I know that there can never be a lasting peace in the region without justice". He told MEPs that he thought the International Criminal Court is the "the most competent international criminal tribunal".
Wine reform: MEP calls for "change of mentality"
Tuesday morning MEPs debated plans to overhaul the EU wine sector - the EU is the world’s leading producer, consumer, exporter and importer of wine. The aim of the reform is to bring the EU wine sector into line with market trends such as shifting consumption patterns, enabling European wines to become more competitive on internal and world markets.
The Italian MEP Giuseppe Castiglione (EPP-ED) who acted as the rapporteur called for a "necessary and "radical" reform. He said investment in the wine sector was the only way to guarantee its future. He also called for a change in mentality and move from a mentality of "quantity" to one of "quality".
Condemnation of Algiers bombs
Mr Pöttering condemned bomb attacks in Algiers on Tuesday which killed scores of people and sent a message of sympathy to the people of Algeria.
Railfreight rejuvenated / air quality supported
MEPs approved legislation on the "interoperability of EU railways" which should make it easier for freight trains to pass from one country to another without stopping to change crews. MEPs are also demanding measures to revitalise European railways by removing obstacles to the free circulation of trains throughout the European network.
The House also approved a report by Ioannis Varvitsiotis (EPP-ED) on the Diplomatic and Consular protection of Union citizens in third countries and laws to improve air quality.
