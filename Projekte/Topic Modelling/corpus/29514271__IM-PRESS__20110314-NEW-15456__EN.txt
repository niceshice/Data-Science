Consumer rights: greater consumer confidence and a boost for business
2011-03-21 - 17:07
New rules on consumer protection will be put to the vote on Thursday. The aim is to increase the confidence of shoppers and provide transparency for businesses so as to unleash the potential for growth in cross-border commerce within the EU. Parliament will be asked to endorse amendments already approved by the Internal Market Committee as well as a number of new compromise amendments supported by all political groups except the EFD, to provide a stronger mandate for any negotiations with the Council.
The new rules will cover almost all sales made in shops, by phone or online but will particularly strengthen the rules on cross-border transactions. Buyers will know what information they are entitled to receive from the seller, and rules on deliveries will be spelt out. There will also be clear rules on precisely when risk is passed on to consumers as well as on customers' rights to cancel a purchase, change their minds or have a product repaired or replaced.
Current EU rules on consumer protection are the result of four EU directives that set out certain minimum requirements. However, Member States have added rules in a haphazard manner over the years, making EU consumer contract law a patchwork of 27 differing sets of rules and creating uncertainty in cross-border trade for both buyers and sellers.
This directive sparked a record number of around 2000 amendments at the committee stage. Discussion focused on the degree of harmonisation: should the same rules apply across the EU or should Member States be allowed some flexibility to maintain higher standards in certain areas? In its vote on 1 February, the Internal Market Committee, whose report was drafted by Andreas Schwab (EPP, DE), opted for a mixed approach.

Preparing for European Council: MEPs to vote on stability mechanism
2011-03-21 - 17:07
On Wednesday MEPs will debate with the Council and Commission the issues on the agenda for the EU summit of 24-25 March. They will vote the same day on the European Council's proposal to create a permanent stability mechanism for the eurozone. Member States are expected to adopt the stability mechanism at the summit, together with the Pact for the Euro. The European Council must have Parliament's opinion before it can take its decision on the European Stability Mechanism. While backing the mechanism itself, MEPs have been criticising the Member States for creating an intergovernmental system instead of working within the EU framework. The EP Constitutional Affairs Committee will debate the issue on 22 March and may vote to tighten up certain details.
MEPs are expected to insist to the Council and Commission representatives that the Pact for the Euro, dealing with closer economic cooperation, must in no way deflect attention or effort from the legislative proposals on economic governance proposed by the Commission last September. The 'six pack', as these proposals are more commonly described, must be the cornerstone of future economic governance.
Press seminar on economic governance
Journalists are invited to a seminar with leading MEPs on economic governance being held on 23 March from 9am to 1.30pm (Room 7 C 050, European Parliament, Brussels).

Single permit: equal rights and treatment for foreign workers
2011-03-21 - 17:07
Non-EU workers should have the same rights on working time, leave and social security as EU nationals, says the Employment Committee in its amendments to the "single permit" directive which comes before Parliament for a vote this Thursday. The purpose of this directive is to enable potential immigrants into an EU Member State to obtain work and residence permits via a single procedure.
Under the original proposal, non-EU workers would get equal treatment with EU nationals as regards pay and dismissal, health and safety at work and the right to join trade unions. The Employment Committee wants to extend those rights to include equal working time and leave, while clarifying workers' rights to social security and tax benefits.
Non-EU workers would also be able to receive their pensions when moving back to their home country on the same terms as nationals of the Member State concerned. The draft law is not intended to cover long-term residents, refugees and posted workers (who are already subject to other EU rules), seasonal workers or intra-company transferees (who will be covered by other EU laws).
No documents other than the single permit
Allowing Member States to issue additional documents would defeat the whole purpose of having a "single permit", says the Civil Liberties Committee. MEPs support the Commission's proposal, which would not allow EU countries to issue documents other than the single permit.

Parliament stakes out its position on EU budget for 2012
2011-03-21 - 17:07
Sufficient resources for the EU 2020 strategy and improved coordination between European and national budgets are key demands of the draft resolution on the EU general budget for 2012 on which Parliament votes on Thursday following a debate on Wednesday. The Budgets Committee's draft report, designed to lay down the EP's markers for the 2012 budget ahead of the European Commission's formal budget proposals, has been prepared by Francesca Balzani (S&D, IT).
Members of the committee say the budget should be further aligned with the EU2020 strategy to help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger through smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. They also believe that funding at national and European level must be consistent with these priorities and oppose any attempt to limit the budget for sectors relevant to the EU2020 goals.
The level of payments will probably increase next year, notes the committee, as a consequence of this year's legal commitments and since payments always rise at the end of a budget period when multiannual programmes are being fully implemented. The 2012 budget will be the sixth of the current long-term budget framework's seven annual budgets.
The European Commission is set to present its formal proposal for the 2012 budget on 20 April. The budgets of Parliament and the EU other institutions - excluding the European Commission - were covered in a separate report by José Manuel Fernandes (EPP, PT) which was adopted on 9 March.

A joint EU resettlement programme for refugees
2011-03-21 - 17:07
The need to establish a joint EU resettlement programme for refugees from outside the EU will be the subject of a debate with the Council on Wednesday. Currently only 10 Member States resettle refugees on a regular basis, with little coordination among them on the priorities. Given the current situation in north Africa, where some refugee camps are located, it is more important than ever that the EU launches a resettlement programme, argue MEPs.
Parliament has already backed the idea of an ambitious EU resettlement programme, approving by a large majority in May 2010 a resolution on a 2009 Commission plan for the establishment of this programme. Such a programme should provide protection and durable solutions both for long–term refugees and for rapid responses in case of emergency or unforeseen urgency, said that resolution.
Financing resettlement
Member States’ measures to resettle refugees would be financed under an amended proposal on the European Refugee Fund.
To encourage more Member States to take part in the resettlement effort, MEPs proposed that they should receive funding of €6,000 per person for the first year for Member States applying for the first time, €5,000 in the second year and €4,000 thereafter.
"Almost one year after the EP vote, we are still waiting for the Council to conclude the co-decision procedure [on the amendments to the European Refugee Fund to help resettlement] . One year of financial support to the new EU host countries has already been lost", say MEPs. They ask the Council if it plans to give priority to this issue.
Large numbers of refugees are resettled each year in the USA, Canada, Australia, Brazil and Chile but only 10 EU Member States (Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, UK, Ireland, Portugal, France, Romania and Czech Republic) currently have a regular resettlement programme.

Wikileaks, US subpoenas and data privacy
2011-03-21 - 17:07
US court orders slapped on Twitter, and possibly Google and Facebook, requiring the handover of personal data, messages and communications of individuals allegedly linked to Wikileaks (including EU citizens) will be the focus of a debate with Council and Commission on Wednesday. MEPs are expected to argue that the EU should press the US authorities for clarification regarding the subpoenas. The Council and Commission will be asked to explain if EU data protection rules have been violated and if the US authorities have jurisdiction to require EU citizens' privacy rights to be lifted.

Increased imports of duty-free wine from Moldova
2011-03-21 - 17:07
MEPs will vote on Thursday in favour of raising the quota for duty-free wine imports from the Republic of Moldova. Since the country has been experiencing difficulties with its traditional export markets, notably Russia, the European Commission proposes to increase the duty-free quotas from 100,000 hectolitres (hl) to 150,000 hl for this year, from 120,000 hl to 180,000 hl for next year, and to 240,000 hl per year from 2013 onwards.
Parliament is set to give its go-ahead to this change, as a first-reading agreement has been reached with the Council.

EU-US Open Skies: wider market access for airlines on the horizon
2011-03-21 - 17:07
A revised EU-US air transport agreement will be put to the vote by the European Parliament on Thursday. It commits both sides to environmental and social standards in aviation and also provides for further liberalisation of market access, although only if both sides make certain changes to their legislation. The EU-US aviation markets account for about 60% of world air traffic. The first EU-US air transport agreement, signed on 30 April 2007 and effective from 30 March 2008, allowed any EU or US airline to fly between any points in the EU and the US. This led to an increase in services and competition. A second agreement was signed on 24 June 2010 and has been provisionally applied since then, even though after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s consent is required for the conclusion of international air transport agreements, including this one.
In the second agreement, both parties declare an intention to work together to limit or reduce, "in an economically reasonable manner", the impact of international aviation on the environment, namely to reduce the harm from aircraft noise and aviation emissions, as well as to foster research and development of environmentally friendly aviation technology, including alternative fuels. For the first time in aviation history, the agreement also contains an article intended to preserve airline employees' rights.
As soon as the US laws permit majority ownership of its airlines by EU nationals, the EU will allow the same for US nationals, states the new agreement. In addition, from that moment US passenger airlines will have the right to fly direct between the EU and five other countries. Meanwhile, EU passenger airlines will be allowed to fly direct between the US and five non-EU countries once the Commission has gained authority to review noise-based airport operating restrictions.
EU airlines also gain the right to transport passengers and cargo for a US government civilian department or agency. In addition, the agreement will promote mutual acceptance of security measures and coordinated responses to security threats.
The consent of the European Parliament is needed before this agreement can come into force. Parliament's rapporteur is Artur Zasada (EPP, PL).
Parliament will also vote on Thursday on air transport agreements with Canada and Vietnam.

System of preferences for developing countries to be prolonged
2011-03-21 - 17:07
Parliament is expected to back an extension of the EU’s generalised tariff preferences for developing countries for the period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013 after receiving a pledge from the Commission regarding information sharing. Having obtained the political commitment from the Commission, the lead MEP, Helmut Scholz (GUE/NGL, DE), decided to withdraw his amendments to the regulation before the vote in committee.
MEPs in the International Trade Committee had expressed significant concerns that the Commission had not involved the Parliament in the way prescribed by the Lisbon Treaty. Information sharing arrangements and Parliament's other concerns about the decision-making process surrounding the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) will be revisited during the negotiations on the general (Omnibus) review of the scheme later this year.

Stronger economic and diplomatic ties with the six Arab Gulf states
2011-03-21 - 17:07
The political, economic and security issues in the Gulf region are such that closer ties are needed with the Gulf Cooperation Council and its member states, argues a draft resolution by the Foreign Affairs Committee. Further trade negotiations and a broadening of bilateral cooperation to embrace education, research and energy are key demands of the resolution.
The EU should also beef up its diplomatic presence in the region, notably by opening a delegation in each of the six states of the GCC (Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuweit, Bahrein, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar), say MEPs. Lastly, looking ahead to the annual ministerial meeting between the EU and the GCC, in Abu Dhabi on 20 April, MEPs call for regular summits to be held at head of state level.
The resolution has been drafted by Dominique Baudis (EPP, FR) and is scheduled for debate on Wednesday, followed by a vote on Thursday.

MEPs will vote on Thursday on an extension to the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) until 13 September 2013. The main reason for this move is to allow sufficient time for discussion and completion of the procedure for new ENISA legislation designed to overhaul the role and workings of the agency and give it a five-year mandate.
