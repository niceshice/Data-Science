MEPs concerned about EU funding for company relocations
Regional policy
2006-01-24 - 17:03
In a report adopted on Tuesday on relocation in the context of regional development, MEPs stress the need for the Commission and Member States to take measures on the relocation of companies, to prevent potential damage to economic development and in particular the social decline to which direct or indirect job losses can lead.
Rapporteur Alain Hutchinson (PES, BE), speaking before the vote at the Regional Development Committee, said: "European money should not be used to fund the relocation of companies. Large-scale relocation can lead to the destabilisation of an entire region's social fabric".
In a recent study on industrial relocation(1), it was calculated that between 1995 and 2001 some 95,000 industrial jobs were lost in France and relocated abroad, an average of 13,500 a year, a little over half of them lost to the developing countries. Countries where wages are low represent slightly under half of relocation destinations, China being the main destination, far ahead of Eastern Europe, North Africa, South America and other Asian countries.
The Regional Development Committee demands that practices that are not conducive to the achievement of economic cohesion and the strategic goal of full employment, such as unjustified relocation likely to cause job losses, should not be financially supported by the EU.
In the context of regional state-aid, MEPs call on the Commission to take measures with a view to repayment of the aid granted to companies which relocate their plants within or, in particular, outside the EU. The committee backs the idea of penalising companies which, having received European Union aid, relocate their activity within seven years after the granting of the aid.
The committee also wants the European Foundation on the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, based in Dublin, to carry out studies into the impact of the relocation of companies, assessing the number of jobs created and lost, while taking into account their quality.
Lastly, the committee calls on the Commission and the Member States to monitor the effective and targeted use of European funds, which, say MEPs, should be focussed on vocational training and the retraining of workers in regions affected by restructuring or relocation and, in particular, of those workers who have been directly affected by a job loss as a result of the relocation of their former employer.
The own-initiative report was adopted with 41 votes in favour, 5 against with 2 abstentions.
