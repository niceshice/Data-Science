Hungary presidency steps in, Belgium bows out
2011-01-13 - 17:47
Prime Minster Viktor Orbán presents the priorities of Hungary's incoming Council presidency on Wednesday, after Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme has reviewed his country's recent stint at the helm of the EU on Tuesday. Also on Wednesday, European Council President Van Rompuy reports on the EU's December summit. The four main priorities announced by the Hungarian presidency are growth and employment for preserving the European social model; a stronger Europe; a citizen-friendly Union; enlargement and neighbourhood policy.
At the last EU summit, held during the Belgian presidency on 16-17 December, EU leaders agreed on a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone. This will require a limited amendment to the Lisbon Treaty.

Patients' right to seek medical treatment abroad
2011-01-13 - 17:47
Clearer rules on patients’ rights to crossborder healthcare within the EU are one step closer, following a provisional deal reached between MEPs and Council just before Christmas. On Wednesday, MEPs will vote on the draft legislation, which covers key points, such as authorisation and reimbursement. Crossborder healthcare concerns people who choose to seek treatment in another Member State, for example because of excessively long waiting lists or the lack of specialist care in their own country. Currently, Member States spend around 1% of their health budgets on treatment provided beyond their borders.
The draft legislation seeks to clarify how and when medical treatment in another Member State can be covered. It takes account of European Court of Justice rulings that have underlined patients' rights, while seeking to safeguard national social security systems from undue pressures or imbalances.
Patients will, in many cases, need prior authorisation from their home country if they wish to be reimbursed for hospital treatment in another Member State. On the insistence of MEPs - led by rapporteur Françoise Grossetête (EPP, FR) - any refusal would need to be justified according to a fixed list of possible reasons.

Sanctions on Belarus?
2011-01-13 - 17:47
MEPs will discuss December's rigged elections in Belarus, following which opposition leaders were jailed and demonstrators attacked by police. They will then vote on what sanctions the EU should impose on Belarus President Lukashenko and other government figures. Visa bans and a freeze on assets are high on the list of options. The President of Parliament and several EP committees and delegations issued a joint statement on Wednesday calling for an EU travel ban and a freeze on assets of Belarus officials as well as increased EU financial support for independent media and civil society organisations.

EU-Serbia relations on a new footing
2011-01-13 - 17:47
On Tuesday MEPs will debate and are expected to approve the EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which needs Parliament's consent as well as Member States' ratification to enter into force. The agreement, which opens up trade between the EU and Serbia and holds out the prospect of EU membership, was signed in 2008. Member States only started the ratification process in June 2010. So far twelve states have completed the process. MEPs are expected to call on the remaining countries to move ahead with ratification.
Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) remains an essential pre-condition for the EU membership of Serbia, which submitted its application in December 2009. The Council asked the Commission in October 2010 to prepare an opinion on Serbia's application.
Foreign Affairs Committee meeting with Serbian deputy prime minister
On Monday 17 January, the Foreign Affairs Committee will hold talks with Bozidar Djelic, Serbia's Deputy Prime Minister for EU Integration and Minister of Science and Technological Development.

Saving children through adoption within the EU
2011-01-13 - 17:47
Abandoned children can be saved from a life in orphanages if more is done to defend the right of would-be parents to adopt a child from an EU country other than their own, argue MEPs from several political groups in an oral question to the Commission. They also stress the need to safeguard the rights of the adopted children. The problem of abandoned minors has become "increasingly serious and pressing" in Europe, maintain MEPs, who believe that, to cope with this "emergency", the right to international adoption within the European Union must be emphasised.
The Commission is asked to explain what steps it plans to take not only to defend the right to inter-country adoption in the EU but also to protect the children who are to be adopted. The Commission is also asked to provide an overview of the current situation in the 27 Member States.
MEPs will discuss these matters with the Commission on Monday. A vote on a resolution is scheduled for Wednesday.

Lithuania: draft law raises concerns over gay rights
2011-01-13 - 17:47
MEPs will quiz the Commission on the action it plans to take over a Lithuanian draft law which they say "would seriously limit freedom of speech and expression, such as publicly supporting or campaigning for equality or LGBT rights or against discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation" in the country. The draft law is due to apply in public places, including in the media, and may be used to prevent LGBT pride marches from taking place. The oral questions were tabled by the ALDE, Greens/EFA and GUE/NGL groups. Parliament will also vote on a resolution.

Unrest in Tunisia
2011-01-13 - 17:47
MEPs will discuss the widespread rioting in Tunisia, including the violent clashes with the police in the past few days that have left several demonstrators dead. The EP Delegation for relations with Maghreb countries issued a formal declaration on Tuesday calling for an independent enquiry into the violence. Several MEPs urged a suspension of the negotiations for "advanced status" for Tunisia, which would come on top of the existing Association Agreement.
A more in-depth debate on the situation in Maghreb, with statements by Council and Commission, will take place in Brussels on 2 February.

Freedom of religion: a basic human right
2011-01-13 - 17:47
Following recent violence against Christians in Egypt, Iraq and Nigeria, MEPs will hold a debate on Wednesday on freedom of religion, followed by the adoption of a resolution on Thursday. EP President Jerzy Buzek strongly condemned the deadly attack on New Year's Eve on the Coptic Church in Alexandria and called on Egypt to "ensure protection of its Christian minority."
MEPs are expected to urge High Representative Catherine Ashton to ensure that respect for freedom of religion/belief in the world is one of the priorities of the EEAS, given the grave violations of such freedom and the need to provide assistance for persecuted religious minorities in many regions of the globe.

EU-Libya relations: no blank cheque for Tripoli
2011-01-13 - 17:47
Libya must improve the protection of migrants crossing its territory and recognise the status of refugees before Parliament can give its green light to any future cooperation agreement with Tripoli, says a draft recommendation by the Foreign Affairs Committee. The Council and Commission must obtain guarantees from Libya before signing a readmission agreement with a country which has a record of constant human rights violations, believe MEPs.
The planned framework agreement with Libya would cover political relations, immigration and energy, and could pave the way for a free trade area in the long run. Negotiations began in November 2008 and the accord would, if concluded, be the first bilateral contractual relationship between the EU and Libya.
In its draft recommendation to the Council on the negotiations, the Foreign Affairs Committee backs the idea of stepping up EU-Libya relations and opening an EU delegation office in Tripoli. However, it calls for stricter conditions to ensure the protection of migrants and other basic freedoms. Libya, it says, must guarantee the protection of migrants, recognise the status of refugees and impose a moratorium on death penalty. Any readmission agreement with the country should automatically exclude asylum-seekers, refugees or people in need of protection, and rule out mass deportations.

The EU must jump on the Arctic train
2011-01-13 - 17:47
The EU's policy on the Arctic region, including EU participation in the Arctic Council, will be the subject of a debate in Strasbourg on Thursday. Iceland's probable accession to the EU, the search for new oil exploitation opportunities and the effects of the EU's pollution in the Arctic zone, notably on sea-level changes in Member States: all these reasons favour placing the High North region at the top of EU's political agenda and pushing for greater involvement by the EU in the Arctic Council, believe MEPs.
Despite having three Member States in the Arctic zone (Denmark, Finland and Sweden), the EU still lacks a common and clear policy towards the High North. In a draft resolution by the Foreign Affairs Committee, MEPs propose basic guidelines for striking a balance between environmental concerns (melting ice, vulnerable natural resources) and not being left out of the race to exploit natural resources such as oil, gas and fisheries.
The protection of the Sami people (the only indigenous population in the EU), their right to unpolluted natural resources and the need to involve them directly in policy-making for their region are all highlighted by MEPs. They also stress the benefits of Iceland's accession, which would transform the Union into an Arctic coastal entity and consolidate the EU's presence in the Arctic Council, a key intergovernmental forum which already includes members such as the USA and the Russian Federation.

EU strategy for the Black Sea
2011-01-13 - 17:47
The EU needs to give a fresh boost to its strategy for the Black Sea region, to bring peace and stability to the surrounding countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) and to ensure security of energy supplies. A new budget line and more EU human resources are needed for this, says a resolution drafted by Traian Ungureanu on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
The Black Sea strategy should give priority to the funding of small-scale development projects and cross-border cooperation. Regarding conflict prevention, the draft resolution suggests developing "a conflict early warning system" to build confidence in the region and prevent the escalation of violence. MEPs voice particular concern about the extension of the lease for Russia's Black Sea Fleet in Crimea.

Asylum applications: MEPs seek information on costs and update of procedures
2011-01-13 - 17:47
Plans to update the 2005 asylum procedures directive have stalled, partly over the financial implications. The EU also lacks firm information from its Member States about the cost of processing asylum requests. MEPs will ask the Council for more details on both these matters. Some EU governments have expressed concern about the recast of the 2005 asylum procedures directive, notably the financial implications of the Commission proposal, including interpretation and legal aid costs. Members of the S&D and GUE/NGL groups will ask the Council to explain the issues blocking the negotiations and why the proposed recast would generate significant financial costs in the long term.
Members of the EPP and ALDE groups will ask the Council to provide information on the costs of processing asylum applications in each EU Member State. The Commission will be asked to make a comparative study of the costs. Information on these costs is crucial for a reliable and accurate assessment that could enable savings to be achieved, argue MEPs from these two groups.

Illegal logging: traceability of timber from Congo and Cameroon
2011-01-13 - 17:47
In a bid to fight the trade in illegally harvested timber and wood products, MEPs will vote on two draft agreements designed to improve the traceability of timber from Congo and Cameroon. The aim of these "voluntary partnership agreements" is to combat bad governance and corruption as well as providing for better traceability of tropical woods and import controls.
The International Trade Committee, in two draft resolutions by Yannick Jadot (Greens/EFA, FR), gives its backing to the agreements, although it voices reservations about their implementation and asks how they will be enforced. It also calls for measures to combat large-scale deforestation and degradation of intact forests. Illegal logging is regarded as the main cause of deforestation worldwide.
Voluntary partnership agreements between the EU and wood-exporting countries are part of the EU 2003 Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT). The first FLEGT licences issued only for timber exported to the EU are expected by 2011 (Congo) and 2012 (Cameroon).
Under the Lisbon Treaty, Parliament's formal consent is required for agreements of this kind, although MEPs cannot amend the legislation. However, to ensure their views are heard, MEPs have drafted an oral question and a motion for resolution on the voluntary partnership agreements to be discussed with the Commission on Monday evening.
Procedure: Consent + oral question with resolution
Debate: Monday 17 January (2 reports + OQ with resolution)
Vote: Tuesday 18 January Draft report on EU-Cameroon forest law agreement Draft report on EU-Republic of Congo forest law agreement Oral question on FLEGT voluntary partnership agreements Draft motion for resolution Profile of rapporteur Yannick Jadot (Greens/EFA, FR) Press release following International Trade Committee vote (01/12/2010) Legislative observatory file - Congo Legislative observatory file - Cameroon EC website on FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs)

Economic agreement with Fiji and Papua New Guinea
2011-01-13 - 17:47
MEPs are expected to give their green light for the Council to conclude an Interim Economic Partnership Agreement with Papua New Guinea and Fiji, two countries of the Pacific Region with significant exports to the EU. MEPs are nevertheless concerned about the impact that an agreement would have on regional solidarity and economic integration in the Pacific Region. The draft resolution highlights the consequences of the agreement for Papua New Guinea and Fiji in terms of trade relations with the two countries’ closest and largest trading partners, Australia and New Zealand, and also for the fishing, canning and processing industries.
Under the Lisbon Treaty, Parliament will vote on the Interim Partnership Agreement with Papua New Guinea and Fiji under the consent procedure, which allows MEPs to approve or reject the act but without any amendments.
Procedure: Consent + oral question with resolution

A strong EU agriculture to ensure affordable food supplies
2011-01-13 - 17:47
With world food demand increasing and 16% of European citizens living below the poverty line, access to food is increasingly an issue. EU must have a strong agriculture policy to guarantee secure supplies of affordable food, particularly by fighting speculation in food commodities and the ageing of the farming population, says the Agriculture Committee.

Clear EU labelling standards for building products
2011-01-13 - 17:47
Construction products containing hazardous substances will have to be clearly labelled to protect the health and safety of building workers and other people using such products, under new legislation agreed between Parliament and Council which comes up for final approval in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The legislation will also cut red tape for manufacturers, thus removing barriers to the sale of building products across the EU.
Other amendments to the legislation pushed through by Parliament provide for better environmental protection, the recycling of construction products and proper involvement of all stakeholders in the development of harmonised standards.

Looking back - and ahead - at competition policy
2011-01-13 - 17:47
The House will discuss and adopt Parliament's opinion on the Commission's activities in the field of competition policy during 2009. Once again the report calls on the Commission to produce detailed evaluations of the effect state aid had on the economy during the financial crisis as well as how effective state aid has been in bringing about a green economic recovery.
The report also suggests that this would be an opportune moment to tackle tax distortion and move towards a more level fiscal playing field. As is customary, the report also looks into various sectors of the economy where competition deserves further attention such as energy, ICT and health.

Protecting EU citizens from terrorism in the Sahel region
2011-01-13 - 17:47
Terrorism, human trafficking and drug dealing in the Sahel region of Africa have increased sharply and the situation is worsening with the presence of Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, as was demonstrated by the recent killing of two young Frenchmen in Niger. MEPs will discuss with EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton how the international community can boost the protection of EU citizens in the Sahel region of Africa and aid the fight against terrorism.

Humanitarian operations need more support
2011-01-13 - 17:47
More funding for humanitarian aid, a clear division of labour between military and humanitarian bodies in crisis areas, and the creation of a European civil protection force are the main demands contained in a draft resolution on the implementation of the European consensus on humanitarian aid which comes before Parliament for a vote on Tuesday. As the number of complex crises increases (the impact of climate change, large numbers of displaced people, violence among civilians, etc.), MEPs call for more funding to support the growing number of humanitarian operations and for the establishment of a European civil protection force which should put in place an effective system to prevent or cope with natural or man-made disasters.
