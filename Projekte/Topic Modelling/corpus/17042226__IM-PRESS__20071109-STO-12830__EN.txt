Agora - civil society in the Parliament
Last Thursday and Friday saw 400 representatives from across Europe at the European Parliament. They were there as part of the "Agora" platform aimed at more direct democracy and giving people a say in how the EU works. Associations, organisations and trade unions were all present for a series of workshops and debates on the future course of the Union. The need for a "human vision" in policy and projecting Europe's values of democracy and tolerance on the international stage were all stressed.
Agora was set up by the European Parliament last year in the wake of the "No" votes on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands in mid-2005. The Agora forum - the name derives from ancient Greek direct democracy - is an attempt to get people directly involved in discussions over the future direction of Europe now that a Reform Treaty has been signed.
Pöttering welcomes "special day"
Opening the first meeting last Thursday EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering hailed it as a "special day". Welcoming the assembled guests to the Plenary Chamber in Brussels he underlined the shared values of the European Union and said that as the Parliament is the only directly elected EU Institution, it had a right to hold the event. German Socialist Jo Leinen said that "this discussion is never going to end" and that the "democratic structure needs top be developed".
The opportunities and challenges of the new Reform Treaty formed the basis of the two plenary debates and workshops held over the two days.
Among the conclusions that speakers came to were the following:
Make Agora permanent so that civil society and the European Parliament can communicate better.
The need for more participation in democracy (elections) across the EU.
A need for more information between the EU Institutions and the public.
More "human vision" in EU policy
Trying to make policy-making in Europe seem more "human" was also a key conclusion. Delegates called for a "human vision" in policies such as immigration and asylum.
As for the internal workings of the European Union speakers there was a consensus that;
The EU's borders are not set in stone.
New rules are need to ratify Treaties.
The "gender perspective" of policy at an EU level needs to be strengthened.
Greater EU role abroad
As well as looking at the internal workings of the EU civil society speakers also turned their attention to the Union's role internationally.
In particular they;
Called on the EU to take the lead internationally in the search for peace, as a development donor and also in the fight against corruption.
Stressed the need to promote European values such as democracy, the rule of law, tolerance, diversity and freedom of religion.
Agora speakers welcomed the expanded role for the EU's High Representative for the EU's Foreign Affairs as it would represent a substantial improvement in the EU's external policy.
At the closing of two days of debates on Friday, French Green Gérard Onesta said that with Agora "we are creating the missing links between the EU's institutions and its almost 500 million citizens".
