The President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzek welcomed the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo.
EP President Buzek said:
"I warmly welcome the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo. In him we have one of the staunchest defenders of human rights who has fought for the freedom of expression using peaceful means. He stands for the values and fundamental freedoms that the European Union and the European Parliament regard as cornerstones of society. His case was taken up by the European Parliament a number of times.
Freedom is not a threat, but that the threats to freedom can be many.
Advocating for change and for human rights by peaceful means, as set out by Charter '08, must not be punished by a prison sentence. I call on Chinese authorities to release him immediately and unconditionally.
During my official visit to China in May, I met Liu Xiaobo's wife and expressed my solidarity to her.
I also clearly stated that China and Europe are in the process of constructing a bridge, but an essential pillar of this bridge must be the rule of law and respect for civil and minority rights.
