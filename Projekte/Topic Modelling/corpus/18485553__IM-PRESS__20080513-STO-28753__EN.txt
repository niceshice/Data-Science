3rd energy package: after electricity, Industry MEPs turn on Gas

To bundle or unbundle, which way is the EU's gas industry heading?
If you use gas for heating or cooking, or use electricity from gas-fired power stations, then the price and availability of gas is a key concern. On Monday 19 May in Strasbourg, MEPs on the Industry committee will vote on a proposed gas directive that could radically overhaul Europe's gas industry. It would open up the domestic market to competition from other gas companies - meaning more choice and efficiency according to its supporters although some have misgivings over the impact on prices.
The vote is by no means a foregone conclusion. On 6 May MEPs in the Industry Committee voted in favour (31 to 17 with 2 abstentions) of liberalising the electricity market. It is not known whether such a result will be repeated for the gas directive.
Aims of the proposed legislation
At the heart of the Commission's proposals is "ownership unbundling". This is the separation of supply and production of gas. For example, if a network operator is in the same group as the company that supplies or produces energy, it will defend the interests of the group.
However, with unbundling the network could belong to an independent company. In this case it is natural they will allow as many companies as possibility to use its network and maximise profits and efficiency.
Its supporters claim that increased competition between energy companies will lead to more customer choice, greater investment in pipes, terminals and key infrastructure.
When initially announced, the plans for unbundling were opposed by France, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Latvia, Luxembourg and Slovakia. They believe that enforced unbundling is unconstitutional and could have negative social consequences.
Instead, they propose to give EU members the option of undergoing "legal unbundling", whereby companies could retain their network assets by ensuring "an effective separation of interests" - through rules on assets such as equipment and staff.
In the vote on 6 May Members on the Industry Committee narrowly backed an amendment to support unbundling (25-22 in favour), defeating the so called Franco-German "third way" proposals.
Gas rapporteur slams current practice
Parliament's rapporteur is Italian MEP Romano Maria La Russa of the UEN group. He supports "unbundling" and says that such a choice is not based on ideological grounds but rather due to "the reality of the facts".
Mr La Russa has strongly criticised the current situation in the gas market. He sees it as a bad deal for the consumers and says that "gas bills are incomprehensible" to people. He wants a lot more choice and information about suppliers and says at present people cannot gain access to information about their gas consumption and how much they are paying for it.
Will prices go up or down?
There are fears about what will happen to prices in a liberalised market. The EU statistical arm Eurostat collected figures showing that since 1998, prices in liberalised markets such as the UK Netherlands, Spain and Sweden prices have risen by only 6% as opposed to up to 30% in other markets. However, sources of supply and taxes make up most of the price of gas so with oil well over $ 100 a barrel this will have a serious impact.
"Gazprom clause" to protect EU's energy security
The specific challenge of the gas market is the EUÂ´s "serious dependency when it comes to security of supply of gas" according to the rapporteur.
A number of countries - Slovakia, Finland and Bulgaria - are almost 100% dependent on Russian gas. Germany gets around 39% and France 26% of its gas from Russia. Foreign companies like the Russia's Gazprom control an increasing number of gas pipelines.
Therefore a special clause is foreseen in the new directive (dubbed the "Gazprom clause") with the aim to prevent a massive sell-out of strategic EU energy assets and to guarantee equal conditions for all. Namely if a company wants to buy shares in a transmission system operator (a company that could operate the network), an agreement between Brussels and the respective country is necessary to ensure that European companies would be allowed to do the same. The rules of unbundling would apply also to the foreign company. Perhaps not unsurprisingly, Russia has voiced its opposition to the clause.
In addition to the proposals on gas and electricity, an EU agency is also proposed that will draw together 27 different legal frameworks in order to create a truly single European market of energy. The full plenary of the European Parliament will debate both the gas and electricity directives in June.
