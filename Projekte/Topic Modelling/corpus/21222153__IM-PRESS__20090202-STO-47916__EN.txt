Claudio Fava and Roberta Angelilli make their point to fellow Members MEPs welcomed the decision of the new US President Obama to close the Guantanamo prison and and agreed that Europe should take in detainees. However, a few MEPs voiced security concerns. MEPs also discussed CIA rendition flights.
Also on Tuesday MEPs discussed measures to combat child pornography and the new "sanctions directive", under which employers of illegal immigrants would be penalised.
Should Europe take Guantanamo prisoners?
MEPs have repeatedly called on the US to close Guantanamo and continue to support the decision, but the question of whether countries should accept former prisoners proved controversial.
Czech Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Vondra said that the question of accepting former detainees is a national decision, but it is desirable to find a common political response. "This subject raises a number of political, legal and security issues which need further study and consultation".
For the European People's Party Hartmut Nassauer was concerned because "many past and present detainees were trained in terror camps in Afghanistan after 9-11....They are potential terrorists, and we have a duty to protect our citizens".
Martin Schulz for the Socialists agreed that the security of people living in Europe was naturally a vital consideration. At the same time he underlined that now a US President wants to go back to the best values of his country. Schulz asked: "Are we to refuse to help in these circumstances?"
Liberal leader Graham Watson said Europe has to cooperate with the US. "Europe can't stay back and shrug its shoulders and say that these things are for America alone to sort out."
MEPs will vote on a resolution on Guantanamo topic on Wednesday. Join our online debate on this topic via link below.
Fight against child pornography
MEPs discussed the protection of children from the new threats created by new technologies and the Internet? They called for "grooming" - the action of soliciting children for sexual purposes - and paedophile chat rooms on the Internet to be criminalised. Many MEPs underlined the need for the exchange of information between Member States and the importance of data protection.
Care of pre-school children
Voting against the line taken by the Women’s Rights and Gender Equality Committee on a report on gender discrimination and "intergenerational solidarity", MEPs adopted a call for 90% of pre-school children across the EU to have guaranteed access to crèche facilities. At the same time, it called for a review of work-life balance policies in the EU.
Other topics
MEPs also debated Claudio Fava's report on the proposal for new directive for sanctions against employers of illegal immigrants and discussed the issue of the protection of minorities in Europe.
