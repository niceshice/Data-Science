The Commission must take steps to prevent an immediate and sharp cutback in food aid to the poorest people in the EU following the cut in funding for this programme from €500 million to €113 million, insisted MEPs in a resolution on Thursday. Halting an existing and functioning aid scheme abruptly without prior notice or preparation will have a major impact on the most vulnerable EU citizens, says Parliament.
According to the Commission's own estimates, 43 million people in the European Union are at risk of food poverty, a number set to rise due to the economic and financial crisis and the sharp increase in food prices.
The EP calls on the Commission and Council to develop a transitional solution for the remaining years of the funding period (2012 and 2013) and on all stakeholders to assess carefully the appropriateness of the food aid scheme, in particular as an element of the CAP, in the context of the new funding period starting in 2014.
The Commission is also asked to alter the regulation for the most deprived persons scheme, to find a solution to the current deadlock on this issue at Council level.
In today's resolution, adopted by 548 votes to 52 with 26 abstentions, Parliament notes the announcement by Commissioner Ciolos on 29 June 2011 of the proposal to transfer the most deprived persons scheme away from the CAP, and stresses that appropriate funding must be ensured.
Background
The scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union, set up in 1987 under the common agricultural policy (CAP), currently provides food aid for 13 million people suffering from poverty in 19 Member States and has distribution chains involving some 240 food banks and charities.
The scheme came increasingly to rely on market purchases as a consequence of the reframing of the CAP, which had led to reduced levels of intervention stocks, the traditional source of supplies for the scheme.
Following an EU Court of Justice ruling, the Commission proposal for 2012 entails a sudden reduction in funding from €500 million in 2011 to €113 million in 2012.
In its judgment of 13 April 2011, the Court stated that the programme can only use food from intervention stocks and may not spend EU money to buy food supplies on the open market.
As a result of this judgment, the provision in the 2008 EU regulation on food aid regarding additional purchases of food on the market cannot be used as a legal basis for food distribution to EU citizens in need.
