Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty debated

Nuclear Test, Bikini atoll and Enewetak, 21 October 1952. During the cold war the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was the cornerstone of international efforts to control the balance of nuclear bomb-making technology. In the complex post cold-war international environment, the spread of nuclear technology and fears it could fall into terrorist hands have become major concerns. Ahead of the forthcoming Treaty review meeting MEPs are set to question Council and Commission today (Wednesday 10 March) on measures to improve the situation.
The next review conference will be held in May in New York. The European Union is set to participate as observer, coordinating the positions of its 27 member states.
The meeting will be deemed successful if the international community agrees on a coordinated reaction to violations by Iran and North Korea. China is currently against sanctions for Iran. Observers will also be looking for further disarmament progress by the US and Russia who hold the largest stockpiles.
The questions in the Chamber on Wednesday morning will focus on what the Council doing to ensure that the EU has a focused common position? How is the EU cooperating with third countries and international organisations? Finally MEPs will consider what are the priorities and what steps towards further nuclear disarmament will be taken.
After the questions there will be a debate and later a resolution voted for by MEPs.
189 signatories - although some nuclear powers stay out
Negotiated after the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the Treaty aims to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. It has three main elements: non-proliferation - countries with nuclear weapons will not transfer them to others and non-nuclear powers will not seek weapons; disarmament - states are obliged to reduce nuclear stockpiles; and, the right to use nuclear technology peacefully. As we shall see, the last aspect has led to considerable controversy.
At present five of seven confirmed nuclear weapons states have signed the Treaty. India and Pakistan have not. Israel is also believed to have nuclear weapons, but has not confirmed or denied this. Only two states, South Africa and Libya, have abandoned their nuclear programmes.
The EP has already made its position clear calling for Member States to commit to total disarmament and improvement of means of verification.
Nuclear technology: but for what purpose?
The European Security strategy of 2003 - approved by all EU heads of government - called the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction "potentially the greatest threat to our security... we are...entering a new and dangerous period that raises the possibility of a WMD arms race, especially in the Middle East".
The solution has been to try and get all states to respect the NPT and to strengthen the world's nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency. Europe has also offered the "carrot" of lucrative trade incentives and diplomatic links in an effort to persuade countries like Iran to forsake nuclear programmes. Whether this will prove sufficient inducement, only time will tell.
