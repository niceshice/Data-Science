Brussels - Group week
At its meeting on Thursday the Conference of Presidents will consider the terms of reference and the composition of two new parliamentary committees. The first is a committee of inquiry into the Equitable Life case in the UK, in which a million people suffered a catastrophic fall in the value of their retirement savings and investments. The second is the temporary committee on the alleged use by the CIA of European countries for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners. The full Parliament must vote subsequently on the proposals of the Conference of Presidents.
Parliament still has to give its verdict on the agreement on the financial perspective 2007-2013 which was reached at the Brussels summit in December. As a first step the Budgets Committee will on Wednesday adopt a draft resolution and discuss the next steps in the negotiations with the Council and Commission.
Parliament's delegation for relations with Ukraine is holding an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday to discuss the consequences of the gas supply dispute between Russia and Ukraine.
Otherwise the political groups will be using the coming week to prepare for the Strasbourg plenary session of 16-19 January. During the session the Austrian presidency will set out the priorities of its six-month presidency of the European Union. MEPs will vote at first reading on the Commission's latest proposals to open up the provision of port services to competition. A major debate will be held on the future of the European Union and the fate of the constitution. The House will also give its views on the reform of the sugar market and the outcome of the recent WTO talks. Any changes to the plenary agenda will be announced at the pre-session press briefing held in Brussels at 11am on Friday 13 January.
