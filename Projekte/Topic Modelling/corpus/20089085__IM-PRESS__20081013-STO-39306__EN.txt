Safe internet use for children at heart of new report With the increasing availability of the internet, children are being exposed more and more to illicit images and content. A reported 74% of young people between 12-15 years use the internet at least 3 hours a day. Monday sees MEPs discuss new measures to increase the security of children who use the internet.
The report by Italian MEP Roberta Angelilli of the UEN group aims to create a "European Safer Internet Programme". Fellow Members of the cross-party Civil Liberties Committee have already thrown their weight behind the measures.
Nurturing a network of support
Ms Angelilli's report targets the "physical, mental and moral integrity" of children across Europe. It highlights the risk of networking sites such as Facebook, Limewire and MySpace.
With children seemingly having limitless boundaries on the internet, they can fall victim to acts of bullying, harassment and grooming by paedophiles.
With the explosion of mobile phone ownership, the web has also become a space to upload malicious content. Sites like YouTube now actively regulate and monitor content in a bid to crack down on so called "happy slapping" videos where people film others being assaulted.
"Ensuring public awareness of the risks involved in using new technologies, priority should be given to making young people aware of the possible forms of abuse and the importance and value of their own privacy", said Ms Angelilli.
Parent - teacher responsibility stressed
The planned discussion in Parliament hopes to have the Safer Internet scheme approved by 2009 where it will receive an initial â‚¬55 million backing.
The scheme will encourage responsible monitoring of content by immediate family members and try to help to increase the dialogue between media savvy youngsters and adults. It is hoped that through closing this generation gap, parents and teachers can raise the child's awareness.
The identifying and labelling of "safe sites"
In cases of serious paedophile activity, support will be given to NGO's in setting up help lines and national contact points. Concerned parents can already help combat child abuse by contacting InHope.org which has hotlines in 29 countries.
"It is important to continue supporting networks channelling information towards police forces and hotlines", said Ms Angelilli.
Recently joint Irish and Austrian efforts helped to disable a network of websites that provided access to child sexual abuse material.
