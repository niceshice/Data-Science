Parliament to air companies: “Curb CO2 emissions”

Jet engines - powerful generators of CO2 emissions
As competition increases amongst airlines and cheap air tickets are more and more common, MEPs took a look at the environmental effects of the aviation industry last week. As a result Parliament adopted a resolution in which it proposes a combination of measures which on one hand may affect prices of flights while reducing emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Commercial airplanes fly at a height of between 8 to 13 km where they emit the gases which alter the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. The higher the plane flies, the more difficult it is for CO 2 to break down in the atmosphere. Plane emissions are at present just 3% of the EU total but growing rapidly. If no measures are taken by 2012 “increased emissions from aviation will neutralise more that a quarter of the reductions required by the EU's Kyoto target," said British Green MEP and rapporteur Caroline Lucas.
Proposed measures
The resolution intends to apply the rules of the emission trading system in the aviation sector so that airlines which will exceed the limits of emissions will be able to buy emission credits from those who stay below their designated limits. Parliament also calls for improvement of the air traffic management which can save fuel and reduce emissions. Applying this in practice the air companies will shorten waiting times before departure and time spent in the sky before landing when the airport is busy. MEPs also urge the imposition of tax on jet fuel, domestic and intra-EU flights in order to ensure that other kinds of transport can fairly compete with the planes.
EU takes to the skies
As plane emissions are covered neither by Kyoto Protocol nor by any other international climate change rules, the initiative supported by Parliament will put EU to the forefront of fight against climate change. The effects will be significant even if the rules apply only to Union as EU is responsible for approximately half of CO 2 emissions produced by the worldwide international air transport. Although the report is not legally binding, the Commission should take it in into account while preparing the legislative proposal as it will have to be approved by both Parliament and 25 EU members.
