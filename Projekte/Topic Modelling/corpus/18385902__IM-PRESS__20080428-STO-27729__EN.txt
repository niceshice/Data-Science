Rapporteur Jutta Haug reflecting on changes Lisbon will bring
On 24 April the European Parliament completed the first step of its preparations for the 2009 EU budget by setting out its spending priorities. The report by Socialist Jutta Haug also incorporates the changes set to take place in 2009, if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified. How will the new balance of budgetary power between Parliament and the Council of Ministers affect Parliament's grip on the EU purse-strings? We talked to Ms Haug in our search for an answer.
Your report takes account of the changes in the budgetary procedure, set to take place in 2009. If the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, what will it mean for Parliament's ability to influence the budget for 2010?
We are preparing for the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. Our common aim is to have all new procedures in place in time. In respect of the budget procedure, the Lisbon Treaty brings radical changes! The EP and the Council will be on equal footing for all kinds of expenditure.
They will have to find common agreement in the frame of a new budgetary conciliation procedure. Very close cooperation between the budget committee and all specialised committees will be essential to define the EP's political priorities for the 1st reading of the budget (in September or October) in order to have a strong position in the newly created budgetary conciliation. The European Parliament, Council and Commission have already started discussions on issues related to the new procedure.
What impact will the EP´s increased budgetary power have on its ability to influence legislative work in new policy areas?
Under the Lisbon Treaty the budget as a whole must be adopted jointly by the European Parliament and the Council: the current distinction between "compulsory" (mainly agricultural) expenditure on which the Council used to have the last say and "non-compulsory" expenditure (on which the EP had the last say) is abolished.
The annual budget can't be adopted without Parliament's agreement, so the budgetary power of the EP has been strengthened.
What are Parliament's main priorities for next year's budget (2009)?
The resolution on the Budgetary Framework and Priorities for 2009 was the kick-off for the 2009 budget procedure. It focuses on broad and general budget-related issues. In parallel, political groups have expressed political priorities in their resolution on the Commission’s Annual Policy Strategy (APS) for 2009. This EP resolution on APS will help, together with a deep and regular dialogue with the different committees of the House to define EP budget priorities for 2009.
On the basis of this intensive dialogue, the plenary will adopt a strong resolution on the Preliminary Draft Budget proposed by the European Commission with some clear indications as to its main priorities. The EP will adopt the resolution before the summer recess when the Council adopts its opinion on the preliminary draft budget by agreeing on the Draft Budget. The resolution will guide us to in our 1st reading amendments on the Draft Budget between August and October 2008.
