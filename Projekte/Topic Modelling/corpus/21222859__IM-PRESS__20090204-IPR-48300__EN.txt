The European Parliament has adopted a written declaration put forward by Françoise Grossetête, John Bowis, Katalin Lévai, Jan Tadeusz Masiel and Antonios Trakatellis on priorities in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease since more than half of all MEPs have signed it. MEPs underline that Alzheimer’s disease currently affects 6.1 million Europeans and that figure will double or triple between now and 2050 with the ageing of the population.
The written declaration (signed by 424 MEPs out of 785 as of 4.2.2009) calls on the Commission, the Council and the governments of the Member States to recognise Alzheimer’s disease as a European public health priority and to develop a European action plan with a view to:
- promoting pan-European research on the causes, prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease,
- improving early diagnosis,
- simplifying procedures for patients and carers and improving their quality of life,
- promoting the role of Alzheimer’s associations and giving them regular support.
MEPs point out that the disease is the most common cause of dependency and it is vital that political commitment be made in the areas of research, prevention and social protection.
