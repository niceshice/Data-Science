Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: redundancies in the car production sector in France
Budget
2007-10-23 - 14:09
Parliament adopted a report approving the use of the Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for redundancies in the car production sector in France. In March 2007, France requested assistance in respect of two cases concerning redundancies in the automobile sector, specifically suppliers to Peugeot-Citroen and Renault.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is intended to provide additional support for workers who suffer from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns, to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market.
On 12 July, the Commission adopted its proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the Fund for a total amount of â‚¬3 816 280, to be allocated under heading 1a of the financial framework 2007-2013. Parliament's vote will approve the release of this funding for France.
