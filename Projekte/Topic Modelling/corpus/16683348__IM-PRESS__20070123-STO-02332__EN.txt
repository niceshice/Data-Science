Globally, 1000 people a day are killed by light arms
MEPs have given strong backing to report that aims to ensure greater control of the worlds legal and illegal arms trade. Globally, the world spends 15 times more money on arms than on international aid. Much of this is sold to countries that have poor human rights records. A quarter of the trade in small arms - like Kalashnikov rifles and grenades - is illegal. With a third of all arms exports coming from the European Union, MEPs have shown they think the Union has a duty to act.
Meeting last week in their Plenary session in Strasbourg, MEPs adopted an own initiative report on arms exports by Spanish Green MEP Raül Romeva.
The report demands that the EU review the human rights records in arms importing countries and continue the arms embargo against China. It also recommends drawing up a list of countries involved in armed conflict to which arms should not be sold to avoid fuelling the conflict.
Support for new UN Arms Treaty
In terms of what the EU can do internally. The report suggests making the 1998 non-binding "Code of Conduct on Arms exports" legally enforceable. The Code should also be extended to private security companies. The Union should also give full support to the UN's proposed International Arms Trade Treaty which is currently in the early stages of discussion in the General Assembly.
During last week's debate before the vote in support, Mr Romeva referred to the "fundamental contradictions between arms dealings and the Code of Conduct". In particular he noted the sale of arms to places with poor human rights records like China, Colombia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Indonesia, Israel and Nepal – places often cited in resolutions by the Parliament which condemn their human rights records.
Other MEPs who spoke in the debate called for the EU not to become a victim of its own irresponsibility by selling arms. They also drew attention to the contrasting amount of money spent on education and healthcare.
