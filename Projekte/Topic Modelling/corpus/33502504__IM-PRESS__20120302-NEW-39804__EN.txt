Making cross-border inheritances easier
2012-03-08 - 13:57
Avoiding legal disputes and lengthy procedures to settle inheritances where the laws of more than one EU country may apply is the aim of draft legislation to be debated Monday and voted Tuesday. Under the rules as tabled by Legal Affairs Committee, a Dutch woman who marries a Pole and settles in France would be able to choose whether her heirs inherit under Dutch or French law.
In the absence of such a regulation, there could be a conflict between the courts in her heirs' home country (Poland), her own country (The Netherlands) and in the country where she has property (France).
The regulation would also create a European Certificate of Succession designed to make clear the legal position of the person who draws up the will and also to protect the rights of heirs and other parties, such as creditors.
Procedure: Co-decision (1st reading)
Debate: Monday 12 March
Vote: Tuesday 13 March Draft report on laws applicable to succession and creation of European Certificate of Succession Press release on committee vote (01/03/2012) Profile of rapporteur Kurt Lechner (EPP, DE) Legislative Observatory file

Gender pay gap and quotas for women in boardrooms and political bodies
2012-03-08 - 13:57
Proposals to reduce the gender pay gap and use quotas to boost the numbers of women on company boards and in political bodies will be debated Monday and voted Tuesday. Legislation to ensure a gender balance on boards moved one step closer when the Commission opened a public consultation on 5 March. Parliament will reiterate its call for laws to ensure equal payment for women and men for the same work, in a draft resolution, by Sophia in't Veld (ALDE, NL), on its 2011 annual report on gender equality in the EU.
MEPs will also call for new laws introducing quotas to boost female representation in corporate management bodies to 30% by 2015 and 40% by 2020, should national measures fail to achieve this. Parliament last called for such mandatory measures in a July 2011 resolution.
A second draft resolution, by Sirpa Pietikäinen (EPP, FI), will advocate gender parity in political decision-making, including electoral lists and top EU positions.
The draft calls for, inter alia, regular monitoring of measures taken, and binding corrective action where the targets set are not met.
The gender pay gap has closed only slightly in recent years. On average, women in the EU still earn 17.5% less than men, only 12% of executives are women, and only 3% chair a board.
While 35% of MEPs are now women, average female representation across the EU's national parliaments remains unchanged at 24%. Only 23 % of ministers are women.

Iceland, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
2012-03-08 - 13:57
MEPs will debate and vote Wednesday on the progress of Iceland, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina towards joining the EU. Parliament would like Iceland to join the EU. However, the draft resolution notes political divisions within Iceland's government and the Althing (parliament) about EU membership. The EU and Iceland still disagree on issues such as whaling.
The draft resolution on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia says a date should be set for starting its EU accession talks, and stresses the need to begin pre-screening its laws for consistency with those of the EU. However, it also voices concerns about corruption and concentration of media ownership.
The draft resolution on Bosnia and Herzegovina notes that it has a prospect of EU membership only as a single country. It stresses that the state must have the legislative, budgetary, executive and judicial powers needed to meet EU accession criteria, and that undermining state institutions could deprive all its citizens of the benefits of EU integration.

MEPs to scrutinize Dutch discriminatory web site
2012-03-08 - 13:57
EU citizens' basic rights, such as free movement and non-discrimination, will be under the spotlight on Tuesday afternoon, in a debate sparked by the launch of a web site inviting Dutch citizens to post complaints about central and Eastern Europeans living in The Netherlands. A resolution will be put to the vote on Thursday. "It is unacceptable that there should be second-class citizens in Europe. The EU is a community of values, and freedom of movement and non-discrimination are fundamental principles underpinning the European integration process", said Parliament's President Martin Schulz about the web site, which was set up by Dutch PVV party.
Mr Schulz had raised the issue in a bilateral meeting earlier that day with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who declined to comment on the web site on the grounds that it was a party political matter, not a government one.
The web site was strongly condemned by ten Eastern European countries: Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Their ambassadors sent letters to parliamentary leaders in The Netherlands asking them to distance themselves from the initiative and calling on the Dutch Government to condemn it.

Conclusions of the 1-2 March European Council
2012-03-08 - 13:57
On Tuesday Parliament holds its regular post-European Council debriefing with Council President Herman Van Rompuy and Commission President José Manuel Barroso. The 1-2 March summit was hailed by Parliament's President Martin Schulz as the first in two years not to have focused exclusively on crisis management, but many MEPs are nonetheless likely to criticize its pledges to restore growth as too timid. The competitiveness of the EU economy will be discussed separately with Commissioner Michel Barnier in "Question Time" on Tuesday afternoon.

Budget 2013: MEPs to reiterate payments shortfall worries
2012-03-08 - 13:57
EU governments should not "artificially" cut the 2013 budget by ignoring real budget needs and outstanding payments, MEPs will warn EU Member States in a budget guidelines vote on Wednesday. MEPs mean to ensure that Member States do not again place the European Commission in a position where it can no longer honour its contractual obligations, as they did in December last year. The budget guidelines reflect MEPs' wishes and priorities for the EU's 2013 budget. The Commission is currently preparing the draft, which will be presented in mid-April.
However, committee members are also "extremely worried" about the looming shortage of payments in 2012. In December 2011, the Council refused to fund claims amounting to €10 billion, as some Member States questioned the financial data provided by the Commission. These payments had to be postponed to 2012 and are bound to lead to a shortage of funds by the end of the year.
Next year's EU budget should focus on youth employment and small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs), says the draft resolution.
Promoting growth and job creation requires specific action and more budgetary efforts to support competitiveness, innovation and SMEs, which accounted for 85% of newly-created jobs between 2002 and 2010 and are the backbone of economic growth, say MEPs.

Chocolate without exploiting child workers
2012-03-08 - 13:57
As the world's leading consumer of chocolate, the EU must see that children are not exploited as forced labour to harvest the cocoa beans to make it, say MEPs in a draft resolution to be voted on Wednesday. Parliament also votes Wednesday on whether to give its assent to the new International Cocoa Agreement, which says signatories should seek to improve cocoa industry working conditions. The International Labour Organisation estimates that over 215 million children worldwide are used as child labourers. Not all work done by children should be classified as child labour, but studies suggest that some children may have been trafficked to work in cocoa farms in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
Article 42 of the Agreement says that "Members shall give consideration to improving the standard of living and working conditions of populations engaged in the cocoa sector, consistent with their stage of development, bearing in mind internationally recognized principles and applicable ILO standards. Furthermore, Members agree that labour standards shall not be used for protectionist trade purposes".

EU measures against piracy off the Horn of Africa
2012-03-08 - 13:57
About 200 merchant seamen and fishermen are still being held to ransom by pirates operating out of Somalia and in the west of the Indian Ocean. On Wednesday MEPs will ask the Commission and Council what they are doing to remove the causes of piracy and break its backers' financial circuits, and also about the fate of the EU NAVFOR shipping protection force, which was recently cut to 10 ships, from 35 in 2009. The cost to victims of piracy on this key maritime route is estimated at €7 billion a year. Of the 4,000 seafarers taken hostage in the region, 60 have lost their lives.
Despite a marked decline in attacks in 2011, shipowners still paid about €150 million in ransoms.
Procedure: Oral question to the Commission and to Council
Debate: Wednesday14 March
Vote: postponed to next plenary session Oral question on facing effectively the challenge of maritime piracy resolution of 26.11.09on a political solution to the problem of piracy off the Somali coast EU NAVFOR Somalia Website

Deal to end hormone beef trade war
2012-03-08 - 13:57
EU concessions to help put an end to the 20-year hormone beef trade war with the USA and Canada will be put to a vote on Wednesday. The deal allows the EU to keep its ban on hormone-treated beef imports in return for importing more high-quality beef. The US and Canada, for their part, have already suspended import duties on previously "blacklisted" EU products. The beef hormone dispute has affected transatlantic trade since 1988, when the EU banned imports of beef from animals treated with growth-promoting hormones.
The US and Canada, which were worst hit by the ban, retaliated by imposing prohibitive import duties on EU produce such as chocolate, Roquefort cheese, mustard and truffles.

Special committee on misuse of public funds by criminal organisations
2012-03-08 - 13:57
Parliament will vote on Wednesday to set up a special committee with a mandate to investigate misuse of public funds by criminal organisations, mafias included, their infiltration of the public sector, legal economy and financial system. A request to establish such a committee was approved by an overwhelming majority of MEPs in October last year.
Parliament may set up a special committee, whose mandate must not exceed 12 months, on a proposal by its President and leaders of the political groups.
Since the 2009 elections, it has set up two such committees, one on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Resources for a Sustainable EU after 2013 (SURE), and the other on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis (CRIS).
Procedure: Rule 184 (setting up special committees)
Vote: Wednesday 14 March
Draft mandate for a special committee on criminal organisations will be available on Monday, 12 March (via a link below).
