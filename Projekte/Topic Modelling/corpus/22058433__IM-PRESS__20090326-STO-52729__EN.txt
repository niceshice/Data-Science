Thursday, 3 April, MEPs vote in Brussels MEPs backed plans to expand the use of the EU's eco-label or "EU flower" labelling scheme by making it less costly and easier to use. The symbol has already been awarded to over 3,000 products. Thursday they also approved more investment in energy efficient houses. MEPs called for 23 August to be a Europe-wide day of remembrance for victims of totalitarianism.
The proposed new Ecolabel rules set minimum requirements for goods and services in order to be sold in the EU. In theory all products, except food and medicine should be eligible. In order to get the eco-label stringent environmental criteria set at a European level after consultation with industry and consumer organisations will have to be met.
The European Parliament also supported the simplification of rules for the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) - certification for companies and other organisations showing their positive environmental performance.
Remembrance key to reconciliation
MEPs called on European governments to establish 23 August as a Europe-wide Remembrance Day for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes. It would mark the date of the infamous Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939 which enslaved millions. In a resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism they say "there can be no reconciliation without truth and remembrance". They want the past to be documented and archives opened.
Other topics discussed Thursday included:
Regional development funding for energy efficient housing.
Recommendations on the new EU-Russia agreement.
The right of EU citizens and their families to move and reside freely within the Union.
Equal treatment irrespective of religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.
