The President welcomed Yemeni human rights defenders Ms Amal Basha, Mr Esadin el Asbahi and Ms Tawakkol Karman, noting that Ms Karman, a journalist and co-ordinator of the Yemeni youth revolution, would be one of three women to be awarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize for fighting for the safety of women and women's right to work for peace.
Turkey
Mr Buzek had sought during his official visit to Turkey the previous week to revive negotiations by encouraging the Turkish side to find a positive solution to the Cyprus problem before Cyprus takes over the EU Council Presidency.
He had met the President and spoken in Parliament about the need for Turkey to introduce reforms to secure freedom of expression and the rights of women and minorities and had also talked to Patriarch Bartholomew about the situation of Christians in Turkey.
Egypt
Commenting on Egypt's 28 November parliamentary elections, the first since President Mubarak was ousted, Mr Buzek urged the authorities political parties and civil society to work together to ensure that the results reflect voters' wishes.
Morocco
On Morocco, which held parliamentary elections on 25 November, Mr Buzek noted that constitutional reform would give the Moroccan parliament more responsibility.
The President nonetheless regretted that neither Egypt nor Morocco had invited EU election observers.
Incoming MEP
MEP Kent Johansson (ALDE, SE), had taken his seat with effect from 21 November, when his credentials were approved.
