EP President walks and talks with Libya's deputy foreign minister Meeting members of civil society Out with the people in Martyrs' Square Jerzy Buzek and Transitional Council Chair Mustafa Abedel Jalil talk to journalists "You have won the struggle over Gaddafi. Now you have to win the peace and your future," EP President Jerzy Buzek said Saturday during a visit to Libya. "I wish that all Libyans - men and women - reap the harvest of their fight for human dignity and freedom. The new Libya must be a Libya of peace and justice, of democracy and law."
During a two-day visit Mr Buzek met Mustafa Abdul Jalil, the chair of the transitional council, members of civil society and he also talked to the public in Martyrs' Square.
"The guarantees of a free Libya will come mainly from you: civil society, non-governmental organisations, intellectuals, women's organisations and pluralist media," he said. "You will have to raise awareness about novel issues for Libyans: concepts such as democracy, human rights, rule of law and protection of minorities."
The EU is ready to help, but only when Libya seeks support, Mr Buzek said. He said the EP could share expertise on democracy building, election observation and parliamentary cooperation. "In particular, we would like to soon welcome Libyan representatives to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean."
