MEPs adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to adopt a more decisive strategy to tackle industrial restructuring and its social impact. They consider that aid from public funds should be linked to long-term agreements by the management of a company in matters of employment and local development.
Parliament calls on the Commission to ensure that companies respect their social and financial responsibilities, act in a corporately responsible fashion and are fair to all stakeholders, including local and regional authorities and the communities where they are based.
MEPs call on the Commission and the Member States to promote a European dialogue on industrial restructuring as well as on structural reforms of the labour market to secure the advantages of globalisation, while minimising the negative social impact. They stress the importance of a well functioning European Works Council Directive that ensures that information and consultation of workers are properly carried out, and call on the Commission to evaluate of the application of the directive on collective redundancies and company closures and to make proposals for measures to ensure compliance.
Parliament welcomes the forthcoming Globalisation Fund, which will support workers and improve the social and educational infrastructure with regard to collective redundancies, and calls on the Council to adopt its Common Position as soon as possible after Parliament's first reading and to ensure that it can apply retrospectively where the effects of current closures carry over to 2007
Finally, MEPs express their solidarity with all the workers, their families and their communities affected by redundancies.
