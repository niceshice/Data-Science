Votes postponed to May Brussels session following airspace closures
2010-04-15 - 16:28
Parliament has modified its agenda in the light of the air travel disruption: all the votes planned for this week will now take place at the next session on 5-6 May in Brussels. The agenda now also includes a debate on Tuesday morning with the Commission on the impact of the volcanic ash cloud and the resulting airspace closures. The air travel restrictions made it impossible for many MEPs to travel to Strasbourg for the plenary week, so it was necessary to postpone the voting sessions. Most of the debates are going ahead as planned, with the addition of a debate with Commission President Barroso and Transport Commissioner Kallas on the air travel crisis.
The session will end on Wednesday at the end of the night sitting.

Energy efficiency: final vote on further measures to cut consumption
2010-04-15 - 16:28
MEPs will vote in Strasbourg on new energy efficiency legislation for buildings and the new layout of the EU energy efficiency label. These measures - which come in addition to the EU's 2008 climate change package - were agreed with the Council last year but need to be endorsed first by the Industry Committee on Monday and then by the full Parliament on Wednesday. New energy efficiency legislation will help consumers to cut their energy bills and the EU as a whole to hit its climate change target of using 20% less energy by 2020. Building codes of the Member States will require all new buildings to have near-zero energy consumption and require regular inspections of boilers and air conditioning systems. Mandatory labels for household appliances and energy-saving products will help consumers to assess running costs.
Energy-saving buildings
All buildings built from the end of 2020 onwards must have high energy-saving standards and be powered to a large extent by renewable energy. Public authorities' building projects are to lead the way two years earlier. Part of the funding for these changes will come from the EU budget.
Where feasible the energy performance of existing buildings will have to be improved during major renovations. When renovating, owners will be encouraged to install "smart meters" and replace heating, hot-water plumbing and air-conditioning systems with high-efficiency alternatives such as heat pumps.
Buildings account for around 40% of the EU's total energy use and are Europe's largest source of emissions, so improving their energy performance would help reach CO2 emission goals. Simple measures such as better insulation could reduce emissions by up to 80%.
Efficiency label for household appliances and other products
A new layout of the energy efficiency label for household appliances and other energy-saving products allows for additional classes (with "A+++" for the most energy-efficient products) but limits the total number of energy classes to seven.
Furthermore, in future any advertisement promoting price or energy efficiency of fridges, washing machines or ovens will have to indicate the product's energy class.

Airport charges: Member States should bear any extra security costs
2010-04-15 - 16:28
Aviation security measures that go beyond common EU requirements should be paid for by Member States, not passengers, says Parliament's Transport Committee. MEPs want national governments to bear the cost of any security measures that are "more stringent" than common, basic EU standards. Member States would remain free to decide how to share the costs of the basic measures already covered by existing EU rules (metal and explosive detectors, sniffer dogs, hand searches, liquid screeners) but would be required to foot the bill if they chose to introduce body scanners, for instance, which are not yet listed as a common EU aviation security method.
These proposals are contained in amendments to a Commission draft directive being tabled by the Transport Committee for a vote by the full Parliament in Strasbourg next Tuesday.
The committee also wishes to include all commercial airports in this directive, against the wishes of many Member States, who would prefer to restrict its scope to airports serving more than 5 million passengers per year.
Members also strongly support better pricing transparency. They insist that passengers should be able to know exactly what percentage of the fare will pay for airport security.
Many EU governments are opposed to a directive that would require public financing of security charges, since they are currently free to apply their own rules: in most cases the airport authorities now pass on the security costs to airlines, which then pass them on to passengers. But MEPs are determined to take the fight all the way to the Parliament/Council conciliation committee if necessary.

Closer monitoring of air safety outside EU
2010-04-15 - 16:28
Europeans flying outside the EU should be informed about any air carriers in non-EU countries that have been blacklisted by the EU, believes the Transport Committee. In a plenary debate, MEPs will ask the Commission how many other countries have adopted blacklist legislation similar to the EU's and how it can monitor compliance with international air safety standards outside the EU. Since 2005 the Commission has kept a regularly updated list of air carriers not allowed to fly in EU airspace. .

Parliament decides on 2008 budget discharge
2010-04-15 - 16:28
MEPs will look at the way the EU budget was spent in 2008 and then decide whether to approve the financial management of each EU institution and agency that year, under the "budgetary discharge procedure". The Budgetary Control Committee has made recommendations to the institutions and agencies on how they can improve their budgetary management and is proposing that the discharge be granted to all except the Council of Ministers and the European police college. Once a year, Parliament scrutinises how the different EU institutions spend their money. Since November last year, when the European Court of Auditors presented its report for the year 2008, members of the Budgetary Control Committee have studied documents, interviewed Commissioners and directors and discussed how the EU's money was spent.
The committee not only voted on whether to give the institutions discharge but also adopted draft resolutions with recommendations on how to improve EU spending controls. The bulk of the EU's budget, including agriculture and regional funding, is managed by the European Commission.

Animal welfare: step up inspections and penalties
2010-04-15 - 16:28
The EU's 2006-2010 animal welfare action plan has been satisfactorily implemented but existing rules should be better enforced through more inspections and effective penalties, says a draft resolution by the Agriculture Committee. A high level of animal welfare, from breeding to slaughter, can improve product safety and quality and benefit all EU consumers, believe MEPs.
Parliament will be debating and voting on a resolution drafted by Marit Paulsen (ALDE, SE) that assesses the EU action plan on animal welfare for 2006-2010 and calls on the European Commission to propose without delay an action plan for 2011-2015.
The draft resolution also asks the Commission to submit, no later than 2014, a proposal for general animal welfare legislation to achieve "a common understanding of the concept of animal welfare and the fundamental conditions applicable". However, this should happen only after existing rules are properly enforced, say MEPs.

MEPs debate Commission's 2010 work programme with Barroso
2010-04-15 - 16:28
Parliament's political groups will each highlight their legislative priorities for 2010 in a debate with Commission President Barroso, who has been invited to speak about the Commission's Legislative and Work Programme for this year. The programme focuses on four main areas: tackling the crisis and sustaining Europe’s social market economy, building a citizen's agenda, developing an ambitious external agenda and modernising the EU's ways of working.
The Commission will put forward proposals aimed at exiting from the crisis and moving on to a more sustainable and dynamic economy with high levels of employment, productivity and social cohesion. The reform of the working time directive, the action plan for implementing the latest Justice, Security and Home Affairs Programme, the establishment of the European External Action Service and an effective use of existing policy instruments will be other key areas of the Commission's work this year.
The main topic at this week's question hour with Mr Barroso, on Tuesday at 3pm, will be the employment situation in the EU. The Commission's work programme for 2010

SWIFT and PNR: data sharing with USA and Australia
2010-04-15 - 16:28
Following debates with Council and Commission on data sharing issues, MEPs will vote on two resolutions, one restating Parliament's conditions for approving bank data transfers to the USA for anti-terrorism purposes via the SWIFT network, and the other suggesting a blueprint for a standard Passenger Name Record file model. SWIFT: the new negotiation mandate with the USA
The Council is expected to approve on 22 April a new negotiating mandate for the Commission, which would hold talks with the US authorities on bank data sharing through the SWIFT network with the aim of having an agreement signed by the end of June. Having rejected the previous agreement on 11 February on the grounds that it did not protect EU citizens' rights sufficiently, Parliament will vote in Strasbourg on a draft resolution intended to send a political signal to the Commission and Council, reminding them of Parliament's conditions for approving such an agreement, which cannot enter into force without MEPs' consent.
Transfer of passenger name records to USA and Australia
Parliament has also been asked to approve or reject an agreement on the transfer of air passenger data to the USA and Australia. MEPs will vote on a draft resolution which is expected to propose postponement of the vote on this matter so that a standard Passenger Name Record (PNR) file model can be devised that meets Parliament's demands regarding data protection. PNR data, which was initially gathered for commercial purposes, is increasingly being used to combat crime.

Fast-track funding to boost economic recovery of regions
2010-04-15 - 16:28
Regional development projects in the Member States worst hit by the economic crisis will get faster and easier access to EU structural funding, provided an agreement between MEPs and Council is confirmed by a plenary vote on Thursday. As part of the EU's "anti-crisis" measures, advance payments are to be increased for projects that help create jobs in countries most affected by the downturn.
To respond to the economic crisis, EU institutions have agreed to speed up the flow of funding to regional development projects and simplify the structural funds' implementing rules. Job training courses, youth apprenticeships, public works and other initiatives should thus be implemented faster, and projects that might otherwise have been axed for want of national funding may now be pursued. The countries eligible for increased advances from the European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund are Romania, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Rules on the "de-commitment" of funds will also be eased (for funds committed in 2007), to give all Member States more time to spend EU funds. Member States are currently obliged to pay back to the Commission any funds that they have not spent within two years of the approval of their request for funding. The new rules will buy more time for projects not approved or implemented within the deadlines.

Call for full partnership between EU and Latin America
2010-04-15 - 16:28
Closer cooperation over issues such as political stability, climate change and migration should be the focus of the EU-Latin America summit on 18 May in Madrid, where the EU High Representative should play an active role, says a draft resolution by the Foreign Affairs Committee, which also calls for a "full bi-regional partnership" between the two regions.
The new possibilities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon should be used to strengthen the regional partnership launched in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, says the committee. The EU is Latin America's second largest trading partner and the EU is the biggest investor in the region. The resolution looks at challenges facing the two regions such as political stability, illiteracy, climate change and other topics that have risen up the political agenda lately, notably regular and irregular migration.

A sustainable, open, competitive, integrated and safe maritime transport sector: this is the goal MEPs will seek to promote in their recommendations to the Commission for the EU's maritime transport policy until 2018.
Members will vote on Tuesday on a draft resolution stating Parliament's position on issues such as the balance between employment conditions for seafarers and the economic competitiveness of the EU fleet, the appropriate regulation of state aid, the cutting back of administrative barriers and the promotion of alternative fuel solutions to reduce CO2 emissions.

Annual anti-fraud report 2008
2010-04-15 - 16:28
Irregularities in EU budget spending fell from €1.024 million in 2007 to €783.2 million in 2008 but the Commission and Member States still need to step up their efforts to monitor the use made of EU funds, argues a draft resolution by the Budgetary Control Committee. MEPs are expected to recommend improvements in areas such as VAT fraud, the working methods of the EU's anti-fraud office OLAF and Member States' account reporting to the Commission.

Europeana on-line library should be expanded but copyright respected
2010-04-15 - 16:28
Europeana - the EU's on-line library, museum and archive - needs content from more Member States and further EU budget funding, according to a draft resolution by the Culture Committee. An alternative draft resolution tabled by four of Parliament's political groups stresses that access to the portal's material without downloading should be free but copyright must be respected.
The Europeana project, which has been running since November 2008, now contains about 7 million digitised works, including books, maps, film clips and photographs. MEPs support the goal of having 10 million objects in Europeana by June this year and call for a target of at least 15 million by 2015. They urge governments and cultural institutions to speed up digitisation and provide more files, especially audiovisual material. MEPs also argue that a substantial part of the costs of digitisation should be covered by a separate budget line in the next long-term EU budget after 2013.
According to MEPs, Europeana should fully respect intellectual property rights without creating any new copyright or privatising access to digital content. The resolution presented by the EPP, S&D, ALDE and Greens/EFA groups as an alternative to the Culture Committee's text says that "viewing documents without downloading must be free of charge for private individuals and public institutions" and if there are any charges for downloads and printouts of copyright materials, these "should be socially acceptable". This alternative resolution also deletes a proposal by the Culture Committee for a separate online space to be designated on Europeana where users can create content.

Over €2 billion from Europe for rebuilding of Haiti
2010-04-15 - 16:28
MEPs will hold a debate on the €2.25 billion delivered or pledged for the reconstruction of Haiti from the EU budget, EU national governments and the people of Europe. The total amount promised by the international community is €3.97 billion (USD 5.3 billion). Europeans are thus contributing 56% of the reconstruction funding. The official financial commitments to the reconstruction of Haiti were made at the Donors' Conference 'Towards a new Future for Haiti' held in New York on 31 March.
The Government of Haiti's Action Plan will receive €1.235 billion from the EU budget, which comes on top of the €295 million already contributed in humanitarian aid as well as €70 million from EU governments and €650 million in donations from the general public in EU countries. Even though the immediate humanitarian needs have been met and the reconstruction phase has started, there are still 2 million people dependent on relief assistance, with the hurricane season looming.

EU-Canada summit: an end to Czech and Romanian visa requirements?
2010-04-15 - 16:28
MEPs will hold a debate with Foreign Affairs High Representative Catherine Ashton on the EU-Canada summit set for 5 May. The main issues in the debate are expected to be the negotiations for an EU-Canada trade agreement, Haiti and the Canadian visa requirement for Czech and Romanian citizens.
The EU is currently negotiating a new trade deal - know as a comprehensive economic trade agreement (CETA) - with Canada, one of the European Union's oldest and closest partners since 1959. The EU and Canada are also prepared to play an important role in Haiti's reconstruction process. Canada holds the chairmanship of the G8 groups of countries in 2010 and will be hosting the next G20 summit.
Canada still requires visas for Czech and Romanian citizens, a topic likely to be raised during the debate. Parliament will vote on a resolution on Wednesday. Spanish Presidency Commission's website - EU's relations with Canada EU-Canada Summit declaration (Prague, May 2009)

Streamlining EU legislation: MEPs to vote on powers of delegation
2010-04-15 - 16:28
To make EU legislation less technical and less complicated, the Lisbon Treaty introduced a new streamlined system for delegating to the European Commission the power to make minor changes to EU laws. On Tuesday MEPs will decide their position on precisely how the legislative bodies - Parliament and Council - should delegate these powers, under what conditions and limits, and how the Commission's use of such powers should be monitored.

New strategies to help EU adapt to climate change
2010-04-15 - 16:28
Greater understanding of climate change, the mainstreaming of adjustment measures into EU policies and a bigger budget are among ideas put forward in a draft resolution by the Environment Committee on the Commission White Paper "Adapting to climate change". A separate resolution by the Agriculture Committee argues that EU agriculture policy can help slow down global warming but it needs to adapt to the risks created by climate change.
