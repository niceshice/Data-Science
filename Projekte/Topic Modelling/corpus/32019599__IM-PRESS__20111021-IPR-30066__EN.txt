Andrew BOREHAM BXL (+32) 2 28 42319 PORT (+32) 498 98 34 01 EMAIL press-en@europarl.europa.eu Parliament added a debate on the euro crisis summits to the agenda for Tuesday afternoon. President Jerzy Buzek highlighted key economic decisions still to be taken by the Eurogroup and European Council and Wednesday's votes on the EU's 2012 budget. He welcomed Tunisia's first free election, the end of Colonel Gaddafi's rule in Libya, and ETA's renunciation of violence. Finally, he voiced Parliament's sympathy with those close to the 200 victims of Sunday's catastrophic earthquake in Turkey.
The Eurogroup and the European Council need to take decisions in the coming weeks to satisfy citizens and markets that an exit will be made from the euro crisis, said Mr Buzek, noting that European Council President Herman Van Rompuy would be in Parliament on Thursday to report on progress. Parliament will discuss the summits on Tuesday, at 15.00h, further to the Council and Commission statements on the economic crisis. This debate will last 45 minutes, and the day's remaining agenda items will therefore each start 45 minutes later.
The EU budget, on which Parliament votes Wednesday, must be an investment in growth and job creation, he continued, thanking MEPs who had contributed to the success of the previous week's high-level conference on the EU's multiannual financial framework.
Tunisia and Libya
Mr Buzek welcomed Tunisia's first free election, held the previous Sunday, noting that it had passed off peacefully, there had been a 90% turnout, and people had voted "responsibly". He also welcomed the fact that Colonel Gaddafi's death meant his four decades of dictatorial rule over Libya was finally over, and it could set off on the road to democracy.
ETA
The renunciation of violence by the Spanish terrorist organisation ETA the previous week was also welcomed by the President, who stressed that ETA must now "disarm and dissolve". He paid tribute to Spain's counter-terrorism services, and paid tribute to ETA's 829 victims over four decades.
Turkey
Finally, the President extended Parliament's sympathy to those close to the 200 victims of the earthquake that hit Turkey on Sunday. "We share the pain of the Turkish nation", he said.
