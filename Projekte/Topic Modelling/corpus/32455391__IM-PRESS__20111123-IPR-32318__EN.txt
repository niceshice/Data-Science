He pointed to a significant improvement in relations between Europe and Latin America but said a lot still remained to be done. EU High Representative Catherine Ashton shared his view: "We have gone somewhere but we still have a long way to go."
In his speech, President Buzek looked back at the creation of EUROLAT in 2006 and stressed how quickly things can change. "In 2006, Europe was strongly developing, and now it is living through the period of crisis. In Latin America the picture is the opposite", he said, and complimented the Latin American countries on the progress in their parliamentary work.
President Buzek also underlined the growing importance of the Internet in recent years and its role in changing the way politics is done. "Through the Internet, millions of people have access to the same information as politicians. This is a completely new situation."
Both President Buzek and High Representative Ashton highlighted the importance of forging strong strategic relations with countries all over the world in order to fight for human rights and press freedom, as well as to build democracy. Ms. Ashton said the EU would continue to give its support and guardianship to countries going through the democratic process, such as Egypt, Tunisia and Libya.
The Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, EUROLAT, is a joint multilateral parliamentary assembly composed of 150 members, 75 from the European Parliament and 75 from the Latin American component. In the three-day meeting, held in Brussels from 21 to 23 November, MEPs and their Latin American counterparts discussed the financial crisis and globalization, as well as organized crime and natural disasters.
