Online gambling is very big business ©BELGA_AFP_V.HACHE It's common knowledge that gambling is a risky business and the increasing market for online gambling makes it even riskier. On 15 November MEPs urged the European Commission to propose stronger cooperation between EU countries in the fight against illegal online gambling. They also called for stronger measures to protect vulnerable consumers including children.
Online gambling is a fast growing business in Europe with 10% of all gambling taking place over the Internet, via mobile phones or interactive platforms with a value of more than €10 billion euro a year. Rules on gambling vary across the EU with some countries operating very open markets and others restricting or banning some games.
The EP's response to the Commission's green paper on online gambling calls for a coordinated EU approach to online gambling, especially when it comes to the fight against illegal gambling and the protection of minors and other vulnerable consumers.
Creating a more transparent and stable market
The resolution says member states should be free to set rules on online gambling but says there are clear benefits for coordination in some areas. It says member states should introduce a licensing model to provide security for gamblers and to ensure gambling providers follow the rules that have been set down.
It also calls on the Commission to look at the possibility of blocking transactions between credit card issuers and blacklisted gambling providers.
Protecting vulnerable consumers
There should be restrictions to access to online gambling sites in order to protect vulnerable consumers like minors, such as age verification and restrictions for electronic payments. MEPs want the Commission to explore common standards for operators and say a shared European code of conduct on online gambling could be a first step.
