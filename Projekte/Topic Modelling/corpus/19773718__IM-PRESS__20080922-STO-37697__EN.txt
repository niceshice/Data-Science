Internet broadband is part of Telecoms package The "telecoms package" will directly affect millions of European internet users. The reform of the telecommunication sector aims to strengthen consumer rights and privacy protection. Wednesday sees a crucial vote by MEPs on the issue. However, for some bloggers and internet users around Europe it has been contentious, with claims that parts of the package could threaten online privacy.
Reacting to those concerns, British Conservative Malcolm Harbour - who is steering the proposals through Parliament - told us that the interpretation put on some amendments was “alarmist and scare-mongering”.
It is estimated that almost half of us use the internet every day. As most of us now use broadband connections, we have the opportunity to download huge amounts of films, music and books for free.
The telecoms package has been the subject of serious discussions over the last couple of months, with energetic lobbying from both sides. More than 800 parliamentary amendments have been tabled to this far-reaching reform.
Some see clash between copyright rules, online privacy
A crucial part of the package is the report on internet users´ rights. Online groups fear that this new legislation will lead to increased surveillance by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), state authorities and interested parties, such as the music and film industries.
Some present the issue as a head-on collision between copyright rules on one side and on-line anonymity on the other. However, negotiation between the political groups has led to a compromise, which says that i n the absence of relevant EU rules, content, applications and services are deemed lawful or harmful in accordance with national law.
The proposed amendments “have nothing to do with copyright enforcement and this is not, and has never been, the intention of this proposal," said Mr Harbour
Main points
MEPs on the Internal Market Committee who have been looking at the legislation believe that the "reform will strengthen the rights of consumer's choice and contribute to break the monopoly position of big national ISPs".
The main points in the report are:
Transparent pricing and contractual information for consumers
Easier access to e-services for users with disabilities
Strengthened personal data and privacy protection
Making it easier to switch provider
"The Directive adopts a light touch to regulation, so that innovation in the telecoms sector can continue to develop according to consumers' demands", said Mr Harbour.
Next steps
The Industry and Internal Market Committees have already backed the amended "telecoms package". The entire parliament will vote on the package Wednesday .
Broadband the mind
200 million Europeans have access to broadband
60% of all public services in EU are available online
2/3 of all schools use broadband
