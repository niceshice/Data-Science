Parliamentary and regional elections in Afghanistan took place this weekend in a climate of hope and uncertainty. Hope that these polls will herald a new era of democracy and peace. Uncertainty as to whether the cycle of violence and instability can finally be broken. The European Parliament sent a team of MEPs to monitor the poll.
The delegation from the Parliament was part of a wider EU observation team led by MEP Emma Bonino.
Jos√© Ignacio Salafranca MEP, who headed the Parliament's observation team, said the election constituted a "key element in the birth of a new Afghanistan." Referring to the seven candidates, election officials and soldiers from international forces killed prior to the poll, he said that his team paid "the most sincere homage to those who died in the course of democracy." He went to warn "that violence is still very present."
Mr Salafranca said that in the post election situation, "the highest priority should be accorded to institutional capacity building, respect for human rights and the rule of law." He called for consideration to be given to an official "Association Agreement" between the EU and Afghanistan that should contain a strong political component.
In Brussels EP President Josep Borrell congratulated the Afghan electorate for "not allowing themselves to be intimidated."
The President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, was emphatic about the importance of the event, "we are making history. It's the day of self-determination for the Afghan people. After 30 years of wars, interventions, occupations and misery, today Afghanistan is moving forward."
Early estimates suggest that 50% of the country's 12.5 million registered voters took part in the election, a 20% fall in turnout from the October 2004 Presidential poll.
The election comes against a background of violence in Afghanistan. In the last six months over 1,000 people have died in politically-related violence.
Official counting of the results began on 20 September and won't be completed until October. There are 249 seats up for grabs in the Wolesi Jirga (House of the People), 25% of which are reserved for women candidates. A further 34 Regional Councils are being contested.
