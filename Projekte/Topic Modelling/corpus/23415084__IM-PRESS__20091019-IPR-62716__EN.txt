Parliament on Tuesday approved the payment of nearly €5.6 million from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia region, where 1,337 workers lost their jobs when Nokia closed its factory and shifted production to Asia and Latin America.
Between July and November 2008, telecommunications group Nokia moved production from its plant in Bochum, Germany, to China, South Korea, India, Mexico and Brazil. The German authorities applied for EU aid under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in February 2009 and the Commission proposed financial support in August.
Parliament today approved a total of €5,553,850 from the EGF, which will go to the cities of Bochum and nearby Gelsenkirchen, Recklinghausen and Dortmund. All four cities traditionally have higher unemployment rates - from 10.2% to 12.3% - than the rest of North Rhine-Westphalia and Germany.
The funding will cover training, advice and support measures and assistance in applying for jobs abroad. All in all, the measures are expected to cost €11,107,700, of which the EGF will provide half, €5,553,850.
Parliament approved the aid with 598 votes in favour, 49 against and 30 abstentions.
Its report was drafted by MEP Reimer Böge (EPP, DE).
Earlier this year EGF support was granted in three cases, €2.7 million to Spain (car industry) and €3.3 million to Spain and €0.8 million to Portugal (both textile industry). Another 16 applications have been made this year
Note to editors: The funds are not for job losses in Bochum caused by relocation within the EU to Romania.
