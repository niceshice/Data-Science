On Monday 16 June 2008, the European Parliament will hold hearings with Commission Vice-President Jacques Barrot and Italian Commissioner designate, Antonio Tajani. Over three hours, Mr Tajani will answer questions from MEPs about his political career, his views on the EU and his plans for the transport portfolio. Since Mr Barrot is already a member of the Commission approved by Parliament in 2004, his hearing will be shorter, focusing mainly on his plans for the freedom, security and justice portfolio
The hearing of Mr Barrot will take place from 17.30 to 20.00 on 16 June 2008 in room LOW N1.4 at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The hearing of Mr Tajani will follow from 20.15 to 23.15 in the same room.
The hearings are the result of a reshuffle of the Commission proposed by its President José Manuel Barroso following the resignation of Italian Commissioner Franco Frattini, who has been appointed Foreign Minister in the new Italian government. Mr Barroso has proposed that Mr Barrot should take over Mr Frattini’s former responsibilities for freedom, security and justice, and that Antonio Tajani, the new Commissioner-designate from Italy, should take on Mr Barrot’s transport portfolio.
Mr Tajani will therefore take part in a hearing before the Transport Committee, joined by a delegation from the Budgets Committee. For Mr Barrot, the hearing will be organised by the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee and will also include participation from the Legal Affairs Committee and the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee.
The committees concerned will each adopt their evaluations in the form of a letter. These will be made public once they have been considered on Tuesday by the Conference of Presidents. The full Parliament is scheduled to vote (separately) on the new portfolio attributed to Mr Barrot and on the appointment of Mr Tajani to the Commission on Wednesday at 11.30.
Parliament has set up a website with full details of the procedures involved and the timetable for the appointment process - follow the link below. 17:30 23:15 Strasbourg, LOW N1.4 Full details on hearings website EN 2008-06-17 Plenary session Plenary agenda
