What are the priorities for fisheries reform?
How should EU fishery resources be managed? Parliament will set out its views when it votes on a report on Thursday. The social, environmental and economic dimensions of fisheries policy are all equally important, says a report drafted by the Fisheries Committee.
Reducing red tape for smaller companies
Micro-companies could be exempted from having to draw up annual accounts if MEPs approve an amendment to EU accounting rules on Thursday. However, these exemptions would have to be granted by EU Member States, and the companies would still have to keep records of their business transactions and financial situation.
More work for MEPs: more resources needed
Parliament will vote on plans to create 150 new jobs in the European Parliament and increase the budget for hiring MEPs' assistants. Parliament's vastly increased powers and tasks under the Lisbon Treaty mean that extra staff are needed in Parliament's political groups, its administration and to work with MEPs.
Parliament to debate Greek debt crisis and EU 2020 strategy
On Wednesday MEPs will debate the outcome of the informal European Council held in Brussels 11 February. At the summit, the EU leaders made a pledge to help Greece in its debt crisis and issued a statement in which they called on the Greek government to implement measures to reduce the budgetary deficit by four percentage points in 2010.
EP resolution ahead of UN Human Rights Council meeting
Human rights in the EU and around the world, in particular in Haiti, will be the subject of a debate at Parliament on Wednesday.
Gaza conflict and implementation of Goldstone report
Parliament will debate the follow-up to the UN fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict led by former South African judge Richard Goldstone.
MEPs to give their views on Ukraine
Following the European Parliament's debate on Ukraine earlier this month in Strasbourg, MEPs will vote on a resolution on this topic at the Brussels plenary session on Thursday.
Women's rights 15 years after Beijing
Fifteen years after the UN's Fourth World Conference on Women, held in 1995 in Beijing, much remains to be done, believe MEPs, who on Wednesday will debate a progress report on the goals set at the conference.
Investing in energy infrastructure
The EU's energy policy is aimed at securing energy supplies, mitigating climate change and ensuring competitiveness. MEPs will debate and vote this week on legislation designed to enhance the policy by requiring EU governments to give the Commission details of any investment they are making in energy infrastructure. 20100216BRI69065 Final draft agenda - 24-25 February 2010 - Brussels plenary session EuroparlTV - watch live broadcasts from Brussels plenary

Fisheries
What are the priorities for fisheries reform?
2010-02-22 - 16:35
How should EU fishery resources be managed? Parliament will set out its views when it votes on a report on Thursday. The social, environmental and economic dimensions of fisheries policy are all equally important, says a report drafted by the Fisheries Committee. According to the draft report by Maria do Céu Patrão Neves (EPP, PT), the new European fisheries policy should "take account of a multitude of dimensions – social, environmental and economic" - without a hierarchy among them. The key principles of the reform should be to give more responsibility to fishermen through rules favouring good fishing practice, and to adjust fisheries management models to improve and complement the traditional quota system.
Fisheries management must abandon the "top-down approach", instead emphasising regionalisation, subsidiarity and participation of stakeholders, so as to take better account of the local particularities of Europe's seas and fleets.
Lastly the report asks the Commission to consider carefully new management models to complement the traditional system of total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas. This should facilitate a gradual phasing out of discards of unwanted by-catches – an unsustainable practice in the view of MEPs.
The Lisbon Treaty gives Parliament full legislative powers over the EU fisheries policy, which is due to be overhauled in the coming years.
Some statistics on fisheries
88% of fish stocks in the EU 2008 are considered to be beyond their "maximum sustainable yield". In other words, present catch levels must lead to lower catches in the longer term.
Of these stocks, 30% may be not able to recover, in other words they are beyond their safe biological limits.
60% of fish consumed in the EU is caught outside EU waters.
Discards can amount to 80% in extreme cases. Procedure: Own-initiative report
Debate: Thursday, 25 February
Vote: Thursday, 25 February MEPs set out fisheries policy reform priorities: 27-01-2010 Report on Green Paper on reform of the common fisheries policy Profile of rapporteur Maria do Céu PATRÃO NEVES

Economic and monetary affairs
Reducing red tape for smaller companies
2010-02-22 - 16:35
Micro-companies could be exempted from having to draw up annual accounts if MEPs approve an amendment to EU accounting rules on Thursday. However, these exemptions would have to be granted by EU Member States, and the companies would still have to keep records of their business transactions and financial situation. About 7.2 million EU companies are subject to reporting rules under the EU accounting directives. Some 5.4 million (around 75%) of these are "micro-entities". They are primarily engaged in business at local or regional level, with little or no cross-border activity. This proposal would enable Member States to simplify the business environment for micro-companies by lifting the reporting requirements that apply to them, so as to enhance their competitiveness and release their growth potential.
The exemption from having to draw up annual accounts would apply to companies that meet two of the following criteria: balance sheet total under €500,000, net turnover under €1,000,000 and/or average of 10 employees during the financial year.
The Legal Affairs Committee argues in its draft report that Member States should have a free choice of whether or not to exempt micro-entities, "taking account in particular of the situation at national level regarding the number of businesses covered" under these threshold values. To address concerns that an exemption from accounting duties could hamper internal organisation and reduce transparency and access to information, the committee made it clear that micro-entities must still be subject to the obligation to keep records that show the company’s business transactions and financial situation, “as a minimum standard”. Procedure: ordinary legislative procedure (co-decision)

Budget
More work for MEPs: more resources needed
2010-02-22 - 16:35
Parliament will vote on plans to create 150 new jobs in the European Parliament and increase the budget for hiring MEPs' assistants. Parliament's vastly increased powers and tasks under the Lisbon Treaty mean that extra staff are needed in Parliament's political groups, its administration and to work with MEPs. The total cost of the new "Lisbon posts" would be €13.4 million, which represents 0.8% of Parliament's 2010 budget of €1.6 billion. By way of compensation, the Budgets Committee decided to cut Parliament's internal reserve for buildings by €4 million, thus enabling it to stay within its self-imposed margin of 20% of the administrative expenditure of all EU institutions, using the financial perspective as a basis of reference.
The estimates on which Parliament will vote suggest hiring an additional 75 civil servants and adding 75 posts to the staff of the political groups. The budget for hiring MEPs’ assistants, which is handled by Parliament's administrative services and not paid to MEPs themselves, would be raised by €1,500 per month and per MEP. MEPs would thus be able to hire more or better-qualified staff to help them cope with their new legislative responsibilities.
After the vote in plenary, the Commission, which is the only EU institution allowed to propose amending budgets, will need to table a proposal, which could then be approved by the Council and Parliament in April. P rocedure: Budgetary

2010-02-22 - 16:35
Human rights in the EU and around the world, in particular in Haiti, will be the subject of a debate at Parliament on Wednesday.

Parliament is seeking to state its position on these issues ahead of the 13th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNCHR), to be held from 1 to 26 March this year in Geneva, Switzerland. The EP will be represented at the meeting from 14 to 16 March by two Human Rights Subcommittee members: Laima Liucija Andrikienė (EPP, LT) and Richard Howitt (S&D, UK). Debate: 24.02.2010

Gaza conflict and implementation of Goldstone report
2010-02-22 - 16:35
Parliament will debate the follow-up to the UN fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict led by former South African judge Richard Goldstone.
A few days ago UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported to the General Assembly that he could not determine whether Israel or the Palestinians had met demands, made in the report by Richard Goldstone, to carry out credible investigations into actions during Operation Cast Lead.
In a resolution passed 5 November 2009 (resolution 64/10), the UN General Assembly asked the UN Secretary General to report - within three months - on its demands that the Israeli and the Palestinian sides "undertake investigations that are independent, credible and in conformity with international standards into the serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law". In his response presented last 4 February, Ban Ki-moon said he was uncertain whether Israel or the Palestinians had met UN General Assembly demands. "It is my sincere hope that General Assembly resolution 64/10 has served to encourage investigations by the Government of Israel and the Palestinian side", he said.
A resolution will be put to the vote at the March plenary session in Strasbourg. Debate: UN General Assembly resolution 64/10 (1 December 2009) UN Secretary General's report (4 February 2010)

2010-02-22 - 16:35
Following the European Parliament's debate on Ukraine earlier this month in Strasbourg, MEPs will vote on a resolution on this topic at the Brussels plenary session on Thursday. Among the key points are the fact that the recent presidential polls met most OSCE and EU standards on free and fair elections, the need for political and economic stabilisation in the country, the importance of strengthening cooperation between Ukraine and the EU in the field of energy and the need to re-examine the existing visa facilitation agreement.

Women's rights 15 years after Beijing: much still to do
2010-02-22 - 16:35
Progress on aims set out at the 1995 UN gender equality conference in Beijing will be assessed in a resolution to be put to a vote on Thursday. This progress has been patchy, say MEPs in an oral question to the Council and the Commission.
Much remains to be done to improve gender equality in the EU and worldwide, especially where there are no gender indicators for women's human rights, women and the media and women and the environment, say MEPs, who will be looking to improve indicators, with a view to linking the EU's forthcoming gender equality road map and 2020 strategy more closely to the Beijing Platform for Action.

Investing in energy infrastructure
2010-02-22 - 16:35
The EU's energy policy is aimed at securing energy supplies, mitigating climate change and ensuring competitiveness. MEPs will debate and vote this week on legislation designed to enhance the policy by requiring EU governments to give the Commission details of any investment they are making in energy infrastructure. The draft regulation will require Member States to collect data and notify the Commission every two years about any building, modernisation or decommissioning of production, transport and storage capacities in the petroleum, gas, electricity and bio-fuel sectors.
Amendments proposed by the EP Industry Committee aim to clarify some points and change the legal base so that the regulation is adopted under the co-decision procedure, under which MEPs are on an equal footing with the Council. Procedure: Consultation
