ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly - a unique and equal partnership
The Joint Parliament Assembly (JPA) of representatives from 78 African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries together with 78 MEPs debated and adopted five separate resolutions on issues ranging from the situation in Sudan and avian influenza to energy in the ACP countries, during its most recent meeting in Vienna.
Unique in the world, the ACP-EU JPA was created out of a common desire to bring together the elected representatives of the EU - the Members of the European Parliament - and the elected representatives of the ACP states. It is the only international assembly in which the representatives of various countries sit together regularly with the aim of promoting the interdependence of North and South.
In an urgent resolution on Sudan, delegates called on the international community to establish a special fund for the rehabilitation of the Darfur region following the signing of a peace agreement binding on all parties, and the cessation of fighting.
On avian influenza, delegates urged the ACP States to further integrate public health into their national economic and social development strategies, including through networks for disease surveillance, response, control, prevention and treatment, information exchange and recruitment, training and retention of national public health personnel.
European Parliament President Josep Borrell who addressed the opening ceremony of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Vienna said: “Europe cannot be a fortress. Those who believe that a new wall along our southern border will protect them are completely mistaken. If Europe does not go to the South, the South will come, illegally or clandestinely, to Europe.”
