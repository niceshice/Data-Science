Cutting roaming charges was just one achievement of the 2004-2009 term Parliament is elected for a five-year term. The first direct elections to the European Parliament took place in June 1979. Since then there have been elections every five years. The term which is currently drawing to a close was thus Parliament's sixth. Hawk-eyed observers will have noticed that the code numbers for all parliamentary acts and texts adopted in this term include the number 6! Watch out for number 7.
The 7th Parliamentary term will run until 2014 when a new round of elections will be held.
