Interparliamentary Forum on the Future of Europe
As part of the reflection period on Europe, representatives of 29 national parliaments and the European Parliament meet in Brussels 8-9 May to debate questions of concern about the future of the EU. Communication and dialogue is a priority for the EP in this process and in order to stimulate debate between the electorate and the elected and bring citizens closer to the EU the Parliament is also running a series of "Citizens' Forum" at local level.
The need to involve all European citizens in the process of building Europe's future is crucial and MEPs want to use the current period of reflection to broaden the public debate about the future of European integration, especially on the eve of the European Council in June.
This period of reflection and dialogue was launched after the Netherlands and France voted against the constitution last year and will be used by EU leaders in deciding on future action.
The two-day parliamentary forum will be one of the first debates on the future of Europe at an EU institutional level. It has been jointly organised by the Austrian and European Parliaments and was scheduled expressly for 9 May, which is Europe day.
Participants will consider four questions:
The EU in the world and the borders of the Union.
Globalisation and the European social and economic model
What are the prospects for the area of freedom, security and justice?
The future financial resources of the EU.
You can watch live via webstreaming. The results of the deliberations will be available on the press service page.
Citizens' Forums
MEPs are also debating the future of Europe with its people in regional venues in 5 countries in the first part of the year - Germany, Greece, Poland, France and Sweden. Conclusions of the meetings will be sent to EU leaders for consideration during their summit in June. To learn more check the link below. The EP plans further forums later this year.
