Others emphasised that both Israel's desire for security and the frustration of the Palestinian people should be addressed.
MEPs underlined that Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations should resume, and the EU should speak with one voice on Middle East issues. Many MEPs condemned the continuing expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Some said this Israeli policy could backfire and accelerate Palestine's international recognition as a state. Others emphasised that the settlement policy could make a two-state solution impossible.
Parliament is to vote on a resolution on the situation in Palestine on Thursday at noon.
