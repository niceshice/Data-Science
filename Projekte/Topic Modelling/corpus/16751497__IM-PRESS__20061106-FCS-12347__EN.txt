A €115 billion question: making sense of the 2007 EU budget
Budget
2007-04-10 - 17:08
In mid-December last year MEPs reached agreement on the shape of the EU's budget for 2007 by fixing the amount of payments at 115.5 billion for 2007. Given the size and complexity of the European Union's budget, we decided to have a look at how the money is collected, how it is used and what role Parliament plays in the process.
A quick look at last year's spending shows where the money goes: In 2005 €49 billion was spent on agriculture and rural development, €32 billion in aid to poorer regions, €8 billion on internal policies such as research, job creation and security, €5 billion on external actions such as aid for Iraq and rebuilding areas affected by the Asian Tsunami, €0.5 billion in emergency aid, €6 billion on administration and €3 billion in funding for countries that have ambitions to join the EU at some point - like Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Croatia.
The European Development Fund which provides assistance to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries for development cooperation and has €23 billion over the next five years. This is not covered by the EU budget as it is funded directly by EU countries.
The amount allocated for the budget sounds like a lot of money - indeed it is. However, to put it in some form of perspective it still only amounts to 1% of the combined gross national income of all the 25 members combined.
Another perspective would be to look at a more recent budgetary example from the United States. Whilst MEPs were debating the EU budget on October, the US Congress approved €350 billion in funding (nearly 3 times the Union's budget) for the department of defence alone.

A 7 Year itch
Making sure the numbers stack up is vital Given that budgetary wrangles were long, messy and complicated in the 1980's, the framework for EU financing is now agreed by EU leaders (and the Parliament) for 7 year cycles. Last December a late night session of the European Council saw Presidents, Chancellors and Prime Ministers from the Union's 25 members agree a financial deal for the next 7 years under the following headings:
1. Sustainable economic growth: a total budget of €382 billion for structural funds, research and education.
2. Preservation and management of natural resources: €371 billion for the Common Agricultural Policy and environmental policies.
3. Citizenship, freedom, security and justice: Includes €107.7 billion for "justice and home affairs" initiatives and schemes to foster European citizenship. These include such things as youth exchanges, town-twining cooperation between civil society and money to encourage the "European dimension" in the media and culture.
4. EU as a global actor: financing worth €49.5 billion for aid to developing countries, the promotion of human rights, foreign and security policy and supporting development in countries as part of the EU's "neighbourhood policy".
5. Administration (including translation services), accounting for about 5.75% or €49.8 billion.
After the deal agreed by EU leaders, Austria, then holding the EU's rotating Presidency, negotiated with the Parliament on final aspects of the spending. Agreement was reached in April and the Parliament ratified the "Multi-Annual Financial Framework" for 2007-2013 leaving the way clear to start negotiations on the annual budget for 2007.

2007 budget - MEPs view
Parliament's President Borrell signs the budget Initial steps: The European Commission originally drew up with a draft budget, which was then passed to EU Ministers for discussion who cut the proposed budget to €114.6 billion, after which it came to the Parliament for consideration.
The first EP reading was followed by negotiations between delegations of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission to hammer out a compromise, baring in mind that the Parliament would have to last say on non-compulsory expenditure (see previous section).
While a first meeting, on 21 November (just before the Council’s second reading) delivered no result, a week later all the outstanding issues could be resolved, including the thorny issue of new post within the Commission to take account of enlargement.
The agreement also covered the rights of the parliament in relation to foreign policy and EU missions (s.a.) and was endorsed first by the Budgets committee and subsequently, on 14 December by the EP plenary, which thus finalised the 2007 budgetary procedure. The same day the budget was signed by President Borrell and representatives of the Council Presidency and the Commission.
Parliament's changes
MEPs were concerned that the amounts allocated to policies to improve Europe’s competitiveness (such as education and research), and strengthen the EU’s role on the world stage through foreign, "neighbourhood" and development policies would not be sufficient.
Therefore it voted on first reading to increase the total budget. Its proposals included:
1. Sustainable Growth (structural funds, for research and education): €44.86 billion (up €5.3 billion compared to the Council’s draft).
2. Natural Resources (agriculture and environment): €54.72 billion (instead of €54.9 billion).
3. Citizenship, freedom, security and justice: € 1.18 billion (instead of € 10.5 billion).
4. The EU as a global partner: €7.35 billion (up from € 7.3 billion).
5. Administration: €6.94 (up from €6.8 billion).
This brings the total to 115.5 billion in payments . The EU budget is expressed both in payments and in commitments . For the latter the amounts are higher. Commitments refers to amounts the EU Commission can sign up to in terms of payment obligations but which will not necessarily be paid within that same budgetary year. The 2007 Budget in commitments amounts to 126.55 billion.

Where does the money come from?
Focusing on the fine print is key to budgetary understanding In 2005 EU received € 105.684 billion in revenue from the following sources:
1. 65% from EU countries, based on their national incomes (Gross National Income – GNI).
2. A VAT levy equivalent to 15%.
3. Traditional "own resources" such as customs duties, agricultural duties and sugar levies at 13%.
4. Other revenue accounted for 7%. This is such things as unspent amounts from the previous year.
The current system is very complex and makes it difficult to find an agreement between EU members on how to finance the European Union.
The Parliament's view is that the system needs to be replaced by a new, fairer and more transparent system. Parliament intends to call for a conference involving national parliaments to review and replace the own-resources system, ideally by 2009.
The aim is to get to a system “with genuine own resources using a transparent, equitable and democratic system”, as stated in the report of German Christian Democrat Reimer Böge last year.

What about the "Net Contributors”?
Antwerp, Belgium: First port of call for many goods entering the EU In 2006, slightly more than 20% of EU revenues are expected to come from Germany, followed by France (with 16.4%), Italy (13.7%) the U.K 12.4%, and Spain (8.9%).
Debates on the budget often focus on how much countries give and how much they get back from the EU (their "net contributions"). Inevitably, "discussions" arise where different countries feel they are either paying too much or not receiving as much as they should. The latter can be a particularly relevant point as some EU policies like agriculture and regional policy benefit some EU members more than others.
However, contrasting “contributions” with money a country gets back and then presenting a “net balance” is a difficult and controversial exercise. Here's why:
1. Part of the budget is spent on aid (the Union is the world's largest aid donor) or assistance to developing countries and therefore does not "go back" to any EU country. Also, money used to administer the EU through its institutions does not go back to one country but is for all EU members.
2. Many EU-supported projects are international and the funds go to the country where the project is.
3. EU Funds may co-finance the construction of some new infrastructure like a road, a bridge or a tourism project that is actually built by a company that is not from that region or country. Thereby spreading the benefits.
4. The spread of customs duties (which form part of the EU's revenues): These are levied at the place of entry and also arguably paid by the consumer who buys the product. For example, goods coming into the port of Antwerp in Belgium are then distributed all over the EU and so on.
Finally, the EU is by its very nature a community which encompasses solidarity among its members. In the preamble of the founding Treaty it commits members to “strengthen the unity of their economies and to ensure their harmonious development by reducing the differences existing between the various regions…” Therefore many would argue that the redistribution of resources is an intrinsic part of the European project.
This brings the total to 115.5 billion in payments. The EU budget is expressed both in payments and in commitments . For the latter the amounts are higher. Commitments refers to amounts the EU Commission can sign up to in terms of payment obligations but which will not necessarily be paid within that same budgetary year. The 2007 Budget in commitments amounts to 126.55 billion.
Budget: Month by Month
Approval and allocation of the money takes several months Spring: European Parliament adopts a report on the Commission's "Annual Policy Strategy". This allows priorities to be identified and discussed. The MEP who drafted the 2007 report on the budget is British Conservative James Elles.
April/early May: European Commission draws up budgetary proposals based on the above.
July: Ministers discuss the proposals and adopt a draft budget. During this so-called first reading stage all 3 EU institutions meet - "a trialogue" in eurospeak - to hammer out positions.
After the Council’s first reading, the Parliament’s specialised committees analyse the budget lines within their policy area and may propose amendments to the Budgets committee.
Early October: MEPs in the Budget committee are faced with piles of budget documents several meters high. The committee takes a detailed look at the budget lines and whether they accord with the priorities identified by Parliament. It may also choose to reverse cuts by the Council or suggest increases or cuts to budget areas.
MEPs on the committee agree a report with amendments. This is put to a resolution of the full Parliament. This year the committee adopted its report on the 10 October and the plenary approved it on the 23rd.
Apart from the amendments by the budgets committee, the plenary also votes on budget amendments tabled by groups of MEPs (currently 37) or a political group.
After Parliament’s first reading vote, the Council moves to its second reading where finance ministers can fix the amounts for areas of “compulsory expenditure” defined under the EU Treaties or international agreements. This is mainly for agricultural expenditure. It is in this area that the Council may override changes made by MEPs in their first reading.
In other areas - "non-compulsory expenditure" the Parliament has the final say and may therefore reinstate its first reading amendments.
December: Parliament has a second reading and this concludes the annual budgetary procedure with Parliament's President Josep Borrell declaring that the budget has been adopted.
In the 1980s, prior to the introduction of multi-annual budgets, the Parliament exercised its right to reject the draft budget on 3 occasions and to demand a new draft.

Responsibility for the spending
EU funding covers environmental projects A total of 80% of all EU funds are managed by national and local authorities across the EU. However, the European Commission is politically responsible for the execution of the EU budget. The European Parliament has therefore insisted that the national governments must take over more political responsibility for how EU funds are managed in their respective country
The Parliament is the only institution empowered by the treaties to give the budget "discharge" (The purpose is to verify the accuracy of the budgetary management) to the Commission for the execution of the EU budget. The discharge is the decision by which the European Parliament closes the life of a budget exercise. The Parliament bases its discharge decision on recommendations of the Council and on the annual report of the European Court of Auditors.
The discharge procedure begins with the Court of Auditors presenting a report to the Budgetary Control committee. This year, the report on the 2005 budget was presented to the committee in Strasbourg on 23 October and a presentation in the plenary will follow 14 November. The committee also follows up the execution of the budget with hearing the various Commissioners with responsibility for specific policy areas having budgetary implications.
Parliament’s report on the 2005 discharge will be drawn up by Salvador Garriga Polledo of the European People's Party (the largest in the Parliament). The committee will finalise its position by the beginning of April 2007.
