In his announcements at the start of this week's Brussels plenary session, EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering highlighted the anniversary of Lithuania's liberation movement as well as the European Parliament's plans for cutting its own CO2 emissions.
Mr Pöttering opened by congratulating Lithuania on the 20th anniversary of the Sąjūdis liberation movement, which had led to the liberation of the country from the Soviet Union.
The president then drew attention to the forthcoming Green Week at the European Parliament in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, underlining the EP's plans to reduce its CO2 emissions by 30% by 2020.
He warmly welcomed Archbishop Galaktion of Bulgaria as well as a number of recent winners of European prizes for youth and European integration, and lastly a 10-member delegation from Navarre, Spain, all of whom were present in the public galleries.
One minor change to the agenda was announced: the debates on the Aubert and Freitas reports (both on fisheries) would take place slightly later than scheduled, after the debate on retail financial services.
