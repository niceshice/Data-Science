While some countries already have 10 years of experience with initiating ecological transformation, others such as Spain and the UK are now starting to initiate change. ©BELGA Germany leads way with 250, 000 green jobs Curbing climate change and creating jobs in new technologies the aim The term "green jobs" seems to have entered the lexicon rapidly with policy makers eager to exploit the possibility of creating employment that is both economically and ecologically sustainable. In Europe at present Germany leads the way with a quarter of a million green jobs and this is growing dramatically. We spoke to German Green Elisabeth Schroedter who recently drafted a report on green jobs. We asked her exactly what they are and whether such faith in them for the future is realistic.
She said she was confident that "the t ransformation to green jobs will not only mean new highly-skilled jobs, but offers equal potential for job creation in the middle and low-skilled sectors." She advocates an array of public and private funding and investment to get the sector moving. In particular the new jobs will come - according to the report - in the field of renewable technologies and energy efficiency.
We asked her what the main point of her report is:
"The key message of the report is that most jobs are potentially green jobs. A green job saves energy, uses renewable energies, protects natural resources and the ecosystem, and avoids waste and air pollution."
She gave us some examples of green jobs:
There are 3 categories: Newly green jobs, due to new technologies and sectors; jobs in traditional sectors that will experience growth due to new products, like the metal industry which is for example engaging in increased production of wind turbines; and existing jobs that will change to contribute to sustainability, using old and new skills. In the last category we find for example construction workers, heating constructors and bicycle producers.
We asked her when this could happen:
"With clear political commitment and the right decisions, we could start to exploit the green job potential immediately. While some member states have already 10 years of experience with initiating ecological transformation, others such as Spain and the UK are now starting to initiate change. Belgium, as well as the UK, believes in the huge potential for job creation in the construction sector, thanks to increasing eco-renovation of buildings," Ms Schroedter said.
We asked her why people would want a green job?
"The advantage of a green job is that it is a safe job. But it is very important that we ensure that green jobs are also good jobs."
Finally, she had some advice for students:
They should "integrate ecological knowledge into their studies, or chose a topic with strong ecological relevance; then your job for the future is safe!"
In his recent state of the Union speech to the European Parliament the President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso called for Europe to create 3 million green jobs by the end of the decade.
President Obama invoked the New Deal of the 1930's when he spoke of a Green Deal to create jobs in sustainable areas.
