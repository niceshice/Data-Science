Vice-Presidents are members of the European Parliament Bureau. The Bureau is the body that lays down rules for Parliament. It draws up Parliament’s preliminary draft budget and decides all administrative, staff and organisational matters.
The Bureau consists of the President of the European Parliament, the 14 Vice-Presidents and the six Quaestors elected by Parliament for a period of two and a half years (which can be renewed). The responsibilities for each Vice-President will be decided at the next meeting of Parliament's Bureau. Four out of the 14 Vice-Presidents are women.
