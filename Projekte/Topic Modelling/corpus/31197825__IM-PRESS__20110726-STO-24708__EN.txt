LUX Prize 2011 The European Parliament Tuesday announced the three finalists for the 2011 LUX prize are Greece's "Attenberg" by Athina Rachel Tsangari. France's "Les neiges du Kilimandjaro" by Robert Guédiguian and "Play" by Ruben Östlund - a Swedish, French, Danish production.
The short list was announced in the context of the Venice Days section of the Venice International Film Festival. The three films will be screened at the festival between 31 August and 9 September.
The films
" Attenberg " follows the life of 23 year old Marina, who lives with her architect father in a seaside town, as she observes humanity from a distance and deals with the challenges of those she is closest to.
"Les neiges du Kilimandjaro" is about Michel and Marie-Claire, whose happiness is shattered when two armed and masked men violently attack them and steal the money for a trip to Kilimandjaro, and the impact of their discoveries about the perpetrators.
In "Play" Ruben Östlund explores the gang rhetoric and role playing involved in real cases of bullying in Gothenburg, Sweden.
What's next?
MEPs will have the chance to see the films in October and early November after which they will vote for the winner, to be announced 16 November. The LUX prize will be awarded at a ceremony in Strasbourg.
