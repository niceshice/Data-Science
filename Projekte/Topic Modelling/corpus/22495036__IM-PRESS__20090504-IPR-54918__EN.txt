Europarl Today: MEPs not ready to extend maternity leave The European Parliament wants to make it compulsory for assisting spouses to have social security cover. MEPs are also keen to strengthen the maternity leave rights of self-employed women and assisting spouses. The directive on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding has been referred back to the Women's Rights Committee.
MEPs adopted the report by Astrid Lulling (EPP-ED, LU) with 550 votes in favour, 14 against and 57 abstentions, calling for rights for assisting spouses and boosting maternity protection for self-employed women and assisting spouses.
The draft directive defines "assisting spouses" as the spouses or life partners of self-employed workers, when recognised by national law, not being employees or business partners, where they habitually participate in the activities of the self-employed worker. They are often found in farming, commerce, SMEs and the liberal professions.
The Commission is proposing that social security cover should be voluntary but the Parliament argues that membership of social insurance schemes covering sickness, invalidity and old age should be made mandatory for assisting spouses. Indeed, when assisting spouses are offered the choice of being member or not of a social insurance scheme, they often chose not to join, MEPs say.
Moreover, Member States should ensure that female self-employed workers and assisting spouses are entitled to a period of maternity leave adapted to their needs, according to Parliament. The maternity leave should be of the duration of their choice provided that the total length does not exceed that specified in Directive 92/85/EEC on pregnant workers.
Parental leave legislation referred backed to the Women's Rights Committee
Concerning the other draft legislation of the family package, MEPs decided to refer back to committee the report by Edite Estrela (PSE, PT) on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. This decision was approved by 347 votes in favour, 256 against and 10 abstentions on the request of Astrid Lulling (EPP-ED, LU) on behalf of the EPP-ED group. The EPP-ED group argued that there would not be a compromise with the Council at first-reading and that positions within the EP are too different.
