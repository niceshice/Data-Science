The US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, today held an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, and the leaders of the Political Groups in the European Parliament in Brussels.
After the meeting EP President Buzek said:
"I was delighted to welcome Secretary Clinton to the European Parliament earlier today for discussions on a broad range of international issues.
Since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty - which has made the European Parliament a co-equal partner with the Council of Ministers in the EU legislative and budgetary processes - the US Administration has been quick to understand the importance of engaging actively with the Parliament. We greatly welcome their open, engaged approach, of which visits like this are an important example. Mrs Clinton said she was very excited by our joint work in building closer EP links with both the Administration and Congress in Washington.
We all expressed our strong commitment to making the new system of EU diplomacy a success. We discussed the role and potential of the new European External Action Service. Just as it is in Europe's interest to speak with one voice on the international stage, so it is in America's to have a strong, coherent and united transatlantic partner.
We also agreed on the need to address together key challenges, such as the environment and climate change, energy security, terrorism and organised crime, and the search for a peaceful solution in the Middle East. Mrs Clinton expressed strong appreciation for the EU's active leadership role in several fields.
We spoke in depth about the EU's neighbours in the Western Balkans, as well as countries of the Eastern Partnership and Russia. We have a shared vision of the vital role that the EU can play in helping to stabilise the countries of the Western Balkans - where Secretary Clinton had just completed an important visit - by giving them a realistic European perspective. We should fully engage with Russia on common problems, whilst insisting on respect for freedom, human rights and democracy.
We look forward to continuing to deepen the dialogue with our US partners, as we seek solutions together to the many challenges - and indeed opportunities - we face in today's uncertain world."
