Institutions
2009-04-30 - 15:15
On 9 May, the European Parliament and other EU institutions in Brussels will hold the Festival of Europe Open Day, ahead of the European Parliament elections of 4-7 June. This event, like previous ones, aims to bring the EU closer to citizens and show them how it touches upon their daily lives.
The open days are an opportunity for the general public to visit the EU institutions and discuss Europe with EU and national decision-makers and officials. Various fun activities will be offered both inside and outside Parliament, in the European quarter.
Visitors will also be able to put questions about the forthcoming elections, which will mark the 30th anniversary of the first direct elections to the European Parliament (EP).
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering said: "European politics affect every aspect of our daily lives: the environment, health, consumerism, work, equal opportunities… There are decisions to make in every one of these areas, and the European representatives elected by citizens will have to make those decisions for the next five years. This is what is at stake on June: let the voters choose!"
Parliament will also hold a public debate on: "What is the future of Europe? How does the European Parliament influence the daily lives of 500 million Europeans?" from 11.00 to 12:30 and 15.00 to 16:30. Interpretation will be available into German, English, French and Dutch. All Parliament's political groups and several of its directorates-general will be pleased to welcome all visitors at their information stands.
Parliament will open its doors from 10.00 to 18.00
The European Parliament is also holding an Open Day in Strasbourg on 3 May, from 10.00 till 18.00. Debates with MEPs from all the political groups are part of the programme. 20090430IPR54808 EP Open Day site Interinstitutional site on the Open Day - FR version Interinstitutional site on the Open Day - NL version
