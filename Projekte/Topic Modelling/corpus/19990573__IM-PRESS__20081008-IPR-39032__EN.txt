Implementation of social legislation relating to road transport

The European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the implementation of social legislation relating to road transport. MEPs express concern at the shortcomings and delays in the transposition and implementation of social legislation relating to road transport in some Member States. Self-employed drivers should also be included in the scope of the directive, say MEPs.
The aim of Directive 2002/15/EC is to establish minimum requirements in relation to the organisation of working time in order to improve the health and safety protection of persons performing road transport activities, to improve road safety and to align conditions of competition.
MEPs call on the Member States to speed up the process of transposition and to provide for coercive measures in the event of failure.
Self-employed drivers have been excluded from the scope of the directive until at least 23 March 2009. It is important to eliminate disparities between the Member States and to help to ensure fair competition in the road transport sector by including self-employed drivers, say MEPs.
The House calls on the Commission to give consideration to the argument of the European Parliament for the full inclusion of self-employed drivers within the scope of the directive after the transitional period, and to give appropriate priority to the social dimension of road safety and the health and safety of drivers and other road users when drawing up its official impact assessment.
The report was adopted with 382 votes in favour, 232 against and 36 abstentions.
