Joaquín Cortés urges support for Roma minority
The Roma population continues to be discriminated against and this week Spanish Flamenco dancer Joaquín Cortés, himself Roma, came to the European Parliament to seek support for Europe's largest minority. Mr Cortés met EP President Josep Borrell and MEPs.
Roma communities suffer discrimination in the fields of education, political representation and participation, housing and employment. According to the 2005 EU report on racism and xenophobia, "Roma are often stereotyped as criminals, the reality is that many Roma are victims of crime."
STOP ANTI–GYPSYISM campaign
Mr Cortés told MEPs, "the main reason for my presence is that I am of Roma origin and my foundation is the initiator of the STOP ANTI–GYPSYISM campaign...I am here because I understood that this institution...is known as the champion of human rights in the EU."
"I am one of the rare European Roma to whom fortune has been kind as I am able to proudly assert my identity without fear of being persecuted, humiliated or (made a) scapegoat," Mr Cortés said. "We all have to fight for the social integration of Roma culture and hope that in the near future a new generation will live a better life."
Mr Borrell said Mr Cortés could be "the face for the work of the EP to defend the rights of the Roma" and can "promote a positive image of the cause."
The Parliament has been active in this field with a June 2006 resolution calling for measures to fight the extreme levels of multiple discrimination Roma women suffer on the grounds of ethnicity and gender and an April 2005 resolution condemning "utterly all the forms of discrimination faced by the Roma people".
2007 year of equal opportunities for all
Of Europe's 12-15 million Roma, 7-9 million live in the EU, largely in Central and Eastern Europe. Romania, which will join the EU on 1 January, has the highest Roma population in Europe with 1-2 million.
The dancer's visit comes just before the 2007 year of equal opportunities when all EU countries can step up the fight against discrimination against Roma and other minorities.
