Transparency in financial matters - rules of professional ethics
Budgetary control
2008-02-19 - 13:04
Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on transparency in financial matters. The House believes that each institution should adopt rules of professional ethics for its Members, depending on the specific nature of each institution, based on its current practices relating to all relevant financial interests. MEPs call upon the Commission to conduct a thorough review of the composition of its expert groups before the end of 2008.
The report states that: "The Commission shall make available, in an appropriate manner, information on the beneficiaries of funds deriving from the budget held by it when the budget is implemented on a centralised basis and directly by its departments, and information on the beneficiaries of funds as provided by the entities to which the budget implementation tasks are delegated under other modes of management."
The European Parliament recalls that, as regards transparency in relation to the 20% of EU funding managed directly and centrally by the Commission (grants and public contracts); information including identification of beneficiaries is available for inspection on two websites:
For beneficiaries of Grants: http://ec.europa.eu/grants/beneficiaries_en.htm
For beneficiaries of Public Contracts: http://ec.europa.eu/public_contracts/beneficiaries_en.htm
Agriculture subsidies - useful websites
The report observes that the Commission's website http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/funding/index_en.htm currently includes links to the databases of the 14 Member States providing information on beneficiaries of Common Agricultural Policy payments under shared management. The House regrets, however, that the information is so diverse and scattered and of such varying quality that information can hardly be found. It calls on the Commission to learn from the very accessible website http://www.farmsubsidy.org/ which works very well and is set up without public funding.
Professional ethics
The House believes that each institution should adopt rules of professional ethics for its Members, depending on the specific nature of each institution, based on its current practices relating to all relevant financial interests.
Blacklisting of fraudsters
The report recalls that one of the questions examined by the Commission in its preparatory work on transparency was whether fraud could be better deterred by being more transparent about the results of investigations and whether the Commission should establish and publish a "blacklist" of confirmed fraud cases in order to name and shame.
Expert groups
MEPs call upon the Commission to conduct a thorough review of the composition of its expert groups before the end of 2008 and to take action to ensure a balanced representation of interest groups in the membership of expert groups. The European Parliament insists that the Commission must, before the end of 2008, develop an open, transparent and inclusive process for selecting members of new expert groups, and must inform Parliament no later than February 2009 of the new selection criteria.
