Preparations for the European Council - 11-12 December 2008 - Brussels
Parliament will debate the forthcoming European Council of 11-12 December to be held in Brussels at which EP President Hans Gert Pöttering will address the Heads of State and government. The agenda will focus on the Lisbon Treaty, the EU's response to the financial / economic crisis, climate change and energy package, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and external relations and security. Following the conclusions of the last European Council meeting (15-16 October 2008), the Lisbon Treaty is on the 11-12 December European Council agenda for discussion with a view to defining the elements of a solution and a common path to be followed. President Pöttering welcomed the November 2008 Irish Parliament report on Ireland's future in the European Union which has addressed a clear set of issues which need to be addressed. Mr Pöttering said he was certain that solutions can be found to respond to these concerns.
Dalai Lama addresses the European Parliament on Thursday
The Dalai Lama , widely regarded as the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, will address a formal sitting of the European Parliament on Thursday 4 December as part of European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Tenzin Gyatso , the 14th Dalai Lama, was born on 6 July 1935. In 1959, with the suppression of the Tibetan national uprising in Lhasa by Chinese troops, he fled into exile. Since then he has been living in Dharamsala, northern India and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his consistent opposition to the use of violence in his quest for Tibetan self-rule.
Parliament to debate energy and climate change package
On Thursday from 8.30am, MEPs will debate the state of the ongoing negotiations between Parliament, Council and Commission on the climate change package. The package lays down the legislative measures needed to achieve the EU's climate targets agreed by the March 2007 European Council for the year 2020: to cut the EU's greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, to increase the share of renewable energies in the energy consumption to 20% and the share of biofuels to 10%.
Pre-registration of phase-in substances according to the REACH Regulation
The questions to the Commission concern the so called pre-registration phase at the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), responsible for the registration and authorisation of chemicals under REACH. The pre-registration phase runs from 1 June to 1 December 2008. It only applies to certain substances (so called phase-in substances - certain chemical substances already on the EU market).
Financial crisis and EU economic recovery plan
Parliament will debate the future global architecture of financial markets and the EU economic recovery plan proposed by the Commission on 26 November with both the Commission and Council. The Council and Commission will be questioned on the future global architecture of financial markets.
Neighbourhood policy: conditional approval for Israel to widen its participation in Community programmes
MEPs will debate Israel's participation in Community programmes after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. The objective of the Action Plan, concluded with Israel, is to gradually integrate Israel into European policies and programmes. Every step taken is determined by both sides and the Action Plan is tailor-made to reflect Israel’s interests and priorities as well as its level of development.
Budget facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries
The nine-hour negotiation on 21 November between representatives of Parliament and the Council of Ministers delivered an overall deal on the 2009 budget and on the €1 billion agricultural aid for developing countries, the so called "food facility". The report by Gay MITCHELL (EPP-ED, IE) says that the Commission's proposal for a 1-billion-euro fund to address the food crisis is a major, and very timely, contribution to meeting this urgent challenge.
Herring stocks off the West of Scotland
Struan STEVENSON (EPP-ED, UK) for the Fisheries Committee will be proposing a report in a proposal to introduce a multi-annual management plan for West of Scotland herring. The rapporteur recommends that, rather than complete closure of the fishery, a stock recovery plan should be put in place where the biomass falls below 50,000 tonnes. The West of Scotland herring stock is fished mainly by vessels from the UK, Netherlands, Germany and France.
European Cormorant Management Plan
Heinz KINDERMANN (PES, DE) for the Fisheries Committee is urging the Commission and the Member States to create appropriate conditions for the drafting of a Europe-wide cormorant population management plan. With a daily consumption of 400-600g fish, cormorants take more than 300,000 tonnes of fish from European waters every year. In many Member States this is many times more than the volume of edible fish produced by professional inland fishermen and fish farmers. 300,000 tonnes is more, for example, than the combined fish production from aquaculture of France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
Step towards improving the environments for SMEs in Europe - Small Business Act
Considering the importance of small and medium-sized enterprisess (SMEs) to Europe's economy and their contribution to the EU's competitiveness and employment, providing over 100 million jobs, contributing to economic growth, being a major source of innovation and promoting gender equality and regional development, Edit HERCZOG (PES, HU) and Nicole FONTAINE (EPP-ED, FR will be asking the Council what steps can be taken towards improving the environment for SMEs in Europe - Small Business Act. The House will also adopt a resolution on this topic.
EU strategy on Roma
MEPs will debate the EU strategy on Roma after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. Roma communities in Europe – including those describing themselves as Roma, Gypsies, Travellers and Sinti – have long faced discrimination and persecution. With the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 to include new members in central and eastern Europe, the Roma population living in the EU now numbers several million.
Arms exports Code of Conduct
The EU Code of Conduct on arms exports builds on the Common Criteria for arms exports adopted in 1991 and 1992 and also includes a denial notification and consultation mechanism, the first such mechanism ever applied to conventional arms exports. The adoption of the Code marked a qualitatively new stage in the EU's development of a common approach to arms exports as an important element of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Following a Council statement, MEPs will debate arms exports and the EU Code of Contact. The House will also vote on a resolution.
Preventing VAT fraud: yes to better data collection and exchange
As part of a series of measures to help prevent VAT fraud, the Commission is proposing to accelerate the collection and exchange of data on intra-Community transactions, by having companies make monthly electronic statements of their data, as opposed to quarterly statements, often on paper, and imposing a one-month, rather than three month, deadline on Member States to share this information. José-Manuel Garcia Margallo (EPP-ED, ES) on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will be presenting two reports which, while supporting the changes, want to clarify some procedural aspects, and ensure Member States publicise and share best practice.
Tackling VAT fraud: Administrative cooperation
According to the European Court of Auditors, the UK is estimated to have lost €18.2 billion in VAT revenue for the tax year 2005-06. However, solid estimates of the actual volume of VAT fraud are still not available for all Member States. While the report, drafted by Bart STAES (Greens, BE), acknowledges that the actual volume of VAT evasion and fraud is difficult to fully assess, it welcomes the Commission's study on VAT and tax fraud, which is expected to be finalised in 2008 and "should provide reliable estimates". Overall, the Budgetary Committee supports the proposal, but is concerned that the factual basis for the discussion is still incomplete.
Gender inequality and human trafficking in the Balkans
The process of democratic stabilisation is on its way in the Balkans, but there is still a lot of work to be done, particularly with regard to women's rights, says the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. The report, drafted by Zita GURMAI (PES, HU), evaluates the current situation of women in the areas of employment, health and the democratisation process in the candidate countries Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the potential candidate countries Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo.
Cooperation agreement between EU and South Korea to stop anti-competitive behaviour
Noting that competition law between the European Community and South Korea is the most efficient way to tackle anti-competitive behaviour, the Committee on International Trade considers that the Korea-EC Agreement, concluded in early 2008, should be considered in the context of the overall framework of existing agreements between the European Community and the Republic of Korea and those currently under negotiation, in particular the negotiations concerning a potential free trade agreement.
Council regulation on maintenance claims will simplify the lives of EU citizens
Currently, the average maintenance claim in the EU is estimated to be around €4,000 a year. In the UK, 70% of child support maintenance is considered to be "probably uncollectable". The report drafted by Genowefa GRABOWSKA (PES, PL) says the regulation, which will enforce an operational system of cooperation between the central authorities of the Member States, will "result in simplifying the lives of citizens". A Council regulation, which aims to eliminate legal obstacles surrounding maintenance claims within the EU will make decisions on maintenance obligations made in one Member State being legally binding in another. 20081113BRI41902 Final draft agenda - 3-4 December 2008 Watch live broadcasts from plenary on-line

European Council
Preparations for the European Council 11-12 December 2008
2008-11-28 - 09:48
Parliament will debate the forthcoming European Council of 11-12 December to be held in Brussels at which EP President Hans Gert Pöttering will address the Heads of State and government. The agenda will focus on the Lisbon Treaty, the EU's response to the financial / economic crisis, climate change and energy package, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and external relations and security. Lisbon Treaty
Following the conclusions of the 15-16 October 2008 meeting, the European Council return to this matter in December 2008 with a view to defining the elements of a solution and a common path to be followed. President Pöttering welcomed the recent Irish Parliament report on Ireland's future in the European Union stating that "this report represents a further step towards us finding a way to respond to Irish concerns expressed in the Referendum of 12 June, while at the same time allowing the Lisbon Treaty to enter into force. It will certainly inform the Irish Government's preparations for the crucial European Council meeting in Brussels on 11 and 12 December."
More about the European Council
The European Council brings together the Heads of State and Government of the 27 Member States and the President of the European Commission. They are assisted by the foreign affairs ministers of the EU Member States and a member of the Commission. European Council meetings are also attended by the High-Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union, who assists the President of the European Council, and by the Secretary-General of the European Commission.
Though it does not adopt formal legislative acts, the European Council is the most important decision-making body of the European Union. It is the institution that gives the EU the necessary impetus for its development and defines its general political guidelines, in particular in the domain of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.

Parliament to debate energy and climate change package
2008-11-28 - 09:48
On Thursday from 8.30am, MEPs will debate the state of the ongoing negotiations between Parliament, Council and Commission on the climate change package. The package lays down the legislative measures needed to achieve the EU's climate targets agreed by the March 2007 European Council for the year 2020: to cut the EU's greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, to increase the share of renewable energies in the energy consumption to 20% and the share of biofuels to 10%. Current timetable
Negotiations between Parliament, Council and Commission are still ongoing Environment Council: 8 December
European Council: 11 and 12 December
Plenary: 16 December (debate), 17 December (vote) in Strasbourg
Key points
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels (aim for a 30% reduction by 2020, if an international climate change agreement is agreed on)
Avril DOYLE (EPP-ED, IE) report on greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system : The Environment Committee backs the Commission plans to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from most industrial sectors by 21% from 2005 levels by 2020, and phase out free emission permits, leading to full auctioning, with an exception for energy-intensive sectors. MEPs want permit auction revenues to be used for climate change protection measures. They support the proposed single cap and the yearly reduction in emission allowances and agree that from 2013, full auctioning of emission allowances should be the rule. MEPs, say that 85% of all emission allowances for the manufacturing sector should be allocated free of charge in 2013 (not 80%, as proposed by the Commission) and will be reduced to 0 % in 2020. The committee backed the Commission's proposed exception for sectors at serious risk of "carbon leakage". They agree that these sectors might receive up to 100 % of free allowances until 2020.
Satu HASSI (Greens/EFA, FI) on effort of Member States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: Member States should face strict fines and sanctions if they fail to meet national reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions from sources that are not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System says the Environment Committee. MEPs backed national targets proposed by the Commission for 2013-2020. In addition, they set new EU long-term (post-2020) reduction targets of at least 50% by 2035 and of 60% to 80% percent by 2050 compared to 1990 levels.
Member State whose greenhouse gas emissions are below its limit should be able to transfer, sell or lend part of its entitlement to another Member State, to help it meet its target. The transfer revenues should then be invested in energy efficiency, renewable energy or climate-friendly modes of transport, says the amended text. MEPs want the EU to provide grant-based financial assistance for developing countries to help them adapt to climate change. This assistance should increase from €5 billion in 2013 to at least €10 billion in 2020.
Chris DAVIES (ALDE, UK) report on geological storage of carbon dioxide (CCS): The Environment Committee wants all larger power stations built from 2015 onwards to be equipped with the new carbon capture and storage technology (CCS). MEPs want the financing of 12 demonstration projects to be secured by ETS allowances. The Environment Committee adopted a new provision, which the rapporteur had termed the "Schwarzenegger clause", introducing an "emission performance standard" for new power plants with a capacity of more than 300 MegaWatts.
MEPs agreed on a fund for monitoring and remediation of closed storage sides, and want the operator to remain responsible for a closed storage side for at least 50 years.
Guido SACCONI (PES, IT) report on CO2 emissions from cars : A large majority of Environment Committee MEPs backed the Commission's target of an average of 120g of CO2/km for the whole car industry by 2012, compared to the current levels of 160g/km. A target of 130g/km is to be reached by improvements in vehicle motor technology. A further 10g/km reduction, to reach the 120g/km target should be obtained by using other technical improvements such as better tyres or the use of biofuels. MEPs rejected proposals for transitional measures for the car industry until 2015. From 2012, car manufacturers exceeding the targets will have to pay fines - "excess emissions premiums" - for every excess gram of CO2. In line with Parliament's resolution of 24 October 2007, MEPs agreed to set a long-term target of average emissions of no more than 95g CO2 per km as from 1 January 2020, by means of improvement in vehicle motor technology.
MEPs agree with the Commission on allowing small independent manufacturers which produce less than 10.000 new registered cars per year to be released from their specific emissions targets. The committee gives larger independent car manufacturers - producing 10,000 to 300,000 new registered cars per year - the chance to apply for an alternative target of reducing their average specific emissions by 25 per cent compared to 2006 levels.
Claude TURMES (Greens/EFA, LU) report on renewable energy (including biofuels and sustainability criteria), sets national targets for each Member State. On 11 September 2008, the Industry Committee supported the proposal to set binding national targets for each Member State to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity, heating and cooling and transport sectors.
The committee backed the 10% target for the road transport sector for 2020 but stipulated that at least 40% of this target (i.e. 4% of all transport fuels) would have to come from second-generation biofuels, electricity or hydrogen. MEPs also decided to set an interim target of 5% by 2015 for renewables in road transport fuel, insisting that at least 1% should come from these new alternatives that do not compete with food production.
Besides, by 2020, energy efficiency in transport must improve by at least 20% compared to 2005, says the report. The committee also tightened up the proposed environmental sustainability criteria for biofuels and introduced social criteria, such as respect for the land rights of local communities.

Pre-registration of phase-in substances according to the REACH Regulation
2008-11-28 - 09:48
The questions to the Commission concern the so called pre-registration phase at the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), responsible for the registration and authorisation of chemicals under REACH. The pre-registration phase runs from 1 June to 1 December 2008. It only applies to certain substances (so called phase-in substances - certain chemical substances already on the EU market). Pre-registration means that companies inform the agency about which substances they intend to register without submitting a whole dossier. If companies pre-register, they will get extended registration deadlines (for the final registration). Otherwise they will have to register their substances immediately if they wish to continue manufacturing and importing.
Guido Sacconi, on behalf of the PES Group, Satu Hassi, on behalf of the Greens/EFAGroup, John Bowis, on behalf of the EPP-ED Group, Chris Davies, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Jens Holm, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, Johannes Blokland, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group will be asking the Commission questions on pre-registration of phase-in substances according to the REACH Regulation.
Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 on REACH provides that companies have to pre-register phase-in substances by 1 December in order to benefit from the transitional regime. According to the information released by the European Chemicals Agency on its website, the number of pre-registrations received by the Agency is unexpectedly high, and more and more companies are complaining about difficulties in logging in and the long response times during peak hours.
Can the Commission inform the Parliament about the final status of the pre-registration process and the difficulties encountered by ECHA in absorbing the enormous number of pre-registrations?
What action did ECHA and the Commission undertake to ensure that companies were technically able to respond to the obligation to pre-register by 1 December? EP - parliamentary questions Pre-registration of phase-in substances according to the REACH Regulation Oral question to Commission

Economic and monetary affairs
Financial crisis and EU economic recovery plan
2008-11-28 - 09:48
Parliament will debate the future global architecture of financial markets and the EU economic recovery plan proposed by the Commission on 26 November with both the Commission and Council. To open the debate, Pervenche Berès (PES, FR) will put questions to the Commission and Council on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. The questions read as follows:
“The global financial crisis and economic slowdown require comprehensive reforms of regulation and supervision of European financial markets as well as global solutions and a common set of principles. In its resolution on the strategic review of the IMF (March 2006), the EP called for a comprehensive reform of the Bretton Wood Institutions to foster their legitimacy and effectiveness, ensuring that they reflect the international economic situation, as well as a reorientation of the IMF policies.
The EP emphasised the IMF’s core role in stabilising global exchange rate fluctuations, acting as a lender of last resort for countries experiencing serious balance of payment problems, analysing and monitoring financial markets developments and implications for domestic and global financial stability. In this respect, the G20 summit on 15 November 2008 is an important opportunity to enhance international financial cooperation and reform global financial architecture.
The EP welcomes this initiative and considers amongst others, that global standards setters (e.g. FSF) need to think global when looking at possible improvements of supervision and governance of all financial institutions, pro-cyclicality and accounting rules. The EP regrets that the Eurogroup President was not invited to participate in this event and asks that, in the future, both the Council Presidency and the Eurogroup President represent the European Union in such fora.
Does the Council/Commission share the view that the EU would have a stronger voice internationally if it carried out substantial reforms in these areas and does it support the idea of the EU speaking with one voice in all relevant international fora? What is the contribution of the G20 summit to this agenda? How should the EU be better prepared for the next step of this process?
The latest Commission economic forecast predicts that the financial crisis will have severe repercussions for the real economy. What is the state of progress as regards the coordination between Member States’ economic rescue packages?
What is the state of progress as regards the roadmap for a European economic recovery plan requested by Ecofin?
Does the Commission intend to play a role in the elaboration of Member States’ economic rescue packages, in their coordination and in monitoring their implementation? What will be the degree of flexibility allowed for by the Stability and Growth Pact that was mentioned in its communication of 29 October?” Pervenche BERÈS PES FR Oral question on future global architecture of financial markets

Neighbourhood policy: conditional approval for Israel to widen its participation in Community programmes
2008-11-28 - 09:48
MEPs will debate Israel's participation in Community programmes after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. The objective of the Action Plan, concluded with Israel, is to gradually integrate Israel into European policies and programmes. Every step taken is determined by both sides and the Action Plan is tailor-made to reflect Israel’s interests and priorities as well as its level of development. The EP Foreign Affairs Committee recommends that the EP gives its assent for increased participation by Israel in Community programmes as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy. An accompanying resolution links this participation to respect for the commitments given by Israel at the Annapolis summit. Companies and organisations based in the settlements in the occupied territories must not be eligible to take part, say MEPs.
The resolution, drafted by Véronique De Keyser (PES, BE) together with the EP assent recommended by the Foreign Affairs Committee, will enable Israel, like other countries in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) to take more part in EU programmes.
Israel is already fully associated in the EU framework programme for research and development and Israeli bodies have taken part in over 600 research projects under the Sixth Framework Programme.
This cooperation with Israel can serve as an example for cooperation with other Neighbourhood Policy partner countries, believe MEPs. Israel is the first ENP country to ask to take part in Community programmes, something which is allowed under its ENP guideline document of May 2004.
The other 16 ENP partners (Algeria, Armenia, Palestinian Authority, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Lebanon, Libya, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Moldova, Syria, Tunisia and Ukraine) enjoy the same right to take part in Community programmes.
Israeli settlements in occupied territories not eligible
MEPs in the committee call on the Commission and Member States to verify that any participation by Israeli entities in Community programmes complies with EU law and policies.
Measures should be taken to prevent participation in these programmes by Israeli companies and organisations based in the settlements, by tightening up checks on Israeli products imported into the EU under preferential trade rules.
Infringement proceedings should be started if products from the occupied Palestinian territories bearing Israeli labels are exported to the Union.
Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
MEPs in the committee remind the parties of the commitments they made in Annapolis to hold negotiations with a view to concluding a peace treaty by the end of 2008, including respect for Israel's right to live in security and the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.

Budget facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries

The nine-hour negotiation on 21 November between representatives of Parliament and the Council of Ministers delivered an overall deal on the 2009 budget and on the €1 billion agricultural aid for developing countries, the so called "food facility". The report by Gay MITCHELL (EPP-ED, IE) says that the Commission's proposal for a 1-billion-euro fund to address the food crisis is a major, and very timely, contribution to meeting this urgent challenge. The rapporteur looks forward to working closely with them and Council towards the urgent adoption of this important legislation.
"At a time when tens of billions of euro are being used to rescue banks, we should be capable of releasing a billion euro to help developing countries to stimulate their own food production by buying seed and fertilizer," said rapporteur Gay Mitchell (EPP-ED, IE) after the vote in Committee.
More on the €1 billion
The instrument aims to improve access to agricultural inputs and services, including fertilizer and seed, as well as so-called safety-net measures, aiming to preserve or improve agricultural production and to satisfy the basic food needs of the most vulnerable people.
35 countries should be selected To ensure the aid is effective, MEPs decided it should be target on no more than thirty five priority developing countries. They should be selected based on their dependence on food imports, on the level of food price inflation compared to general inflation, agricultural production capacity or political instability caused by the crisis, as in Haiti, Bangladesh or Egypt.
Parliament succeeded in securing funding for agricultural aid for developing countries: it was possible to maintain the total amount of €1 billion that had been proposed for "a facility for rapid response to soaring prices in developing countries" over the three-year period 2008-10. The funds will come from three sources: the flexibility instrument, the emergency aid reserve and the redeployment of funds within the external relations heading.
€760 million is "fresh money", including, in 2008, mobilisation of the Emergency Aid Reserve still available in this year’s budget, amounting to €22 million, and an additional sum of €240 million – this raising of the funding ceiling of the Emergency Aid Reserve (EAR) in 2008 required unanimity in Council and an adjustment of the inter-institutional agreement. €78 million will come from the 2009 EAR. The institutions also agreed on the use of the flexibility instrument for 2009 for €420 million.
The final €240 million will come from the re-deployment of funds in the (external relations) stability instrument which had not already been earmarked for a particular goal.
President Barroso warmly welcomed the decision taken by the budgetary authority (EU Council and Parliament) to adopt the €1 billion Food Facility for developing countries, as the Commission proposed last July to respond to the impact of the food crisis in poor countries. "I’m delighted by this positive decision, which shows that the EU is really committed to action in support of its development ideals. As we tackle the financial and economic crisis, we cannot forget the poorest people on the planet."

Fisheries
Herring stocks off the West of Scotland
2008-11-28 - 09:48
Struan STEVENSON (EPP-ED, UK) for the Fisheries Committee will be proposing a report in a proposal to introduce a multi-annual management plan for West of Scotland herring. The rapporteur recommends that, rather than complete closure of the fishery, a stock recovery plan should be put in place where the biomass falls below 50,000 tonnes. The West of Scotland herring stock is fished mainly by vessels from the UK, Netherlands, Germany and France. Key points
Recent scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) indicates that the stock of herring in the seas to the West of Scotland is slightly overexploited with respect to maximum sustainable yield. Advice from scientific agencies, supported by advice from stakeholders, indicates that better management would result from setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) in the framework of a multi-annual plan.
The plan will be subject to review at least every four years.
In the Commission proposal establishing a multi-annual plan for the stock of herring distributed to the West of Scotland the target fishing mortality rate (measure of catches) is set at 0.25 when the size of the spawning stock is greater than 75,000 tonnes, and 0.2 when it is between 75,000 tonnes and 50,000 tonnes. Should the stock fall below the 50,000 tonne level, the fishery would be closed until it recovers.
Year-on-year variations in TAC would be limited to a maximum of 15% as long as the stock is in good condition (i.e. above the 75,000 tonne level).
The rapporteur does not agree with the Commission that a sustainable fishery can be maintained by managing annual mortality at 0.25 when the stock size is above 75,000 tonnes and at 0.20 when the stock size falls below 75,000 tonnes, but remains above 50,000 tonnes. "Nor do I accept that the fishery should be closed if spawning stock levels fall below 50,000 tonnes. On the contrary, I accept the argument of the Pelagic RAC that such harvest rules represent a ‘blunt’ instrument which could lead to dramatic and unwarranted reductions in TAC and would thus undermine the viability of the fishery and destabilise the industry without adequate scientific justification", he says.
In these circumstances, after taking advice from STECF, the fishery could remain open with a strict recovery plan in place. "The Commission's assessment is uncertain and although the closure of fishing activities will be needed at certain points, it is inappropriate for the fishery to be automatically closed when the spawning stock was estimated to be only slightly below 50,000 tonnes", states the report.
In those years when ICES and STECF can provide estimates of spawning stock biomass at less than 75,000 tonnes but equal to or greater than 50,000 tonnes, the TAC for the following year should be set at 0.2. However, to maintain catch stability in the fishery, the TAC should not vary more than plus or minus 20% from the current TAC in any given year, according to the rapporteur.
In any year when ICES and STECF are unable to provide estimates of spawning stock size or fishing mortalities, the TAC should remain unchanged from the previous year, adds Struan STEVENSON. However, in the second and in each subsequent year during which no scientific forecast is available the TAC should be reduced by 10% compared to the previous year.
Special fishing permits will be required for vessels fishing the stock and these vessels will not be allowed to fish both inside and outside the West of Scotland area on the same fishing trip unless they transmit their catch reports daily to the fisheries authorities in their flag state. Monitoring of licensed fishing vessels with permits to fish in the area will be conducted by utilising electronic log-books with daily transmission of catch reports to the Fisheries Monitoring Centre of the flag Member State, VMS and administrative cross-checks between landing declarations and recorded catches.

European Cormorant Management Plan
2008-11-28 - 09:48
With a daily consumption of 400-600g fish, cormorants take more than 300,000 tonnes of fish from European waters every year. In many Member States this is many times more than the volume of edible fish produced by professional inland fishermen and fish farmers. 300,000 tonnes is more, for example, than the combined fish production from aquaculture of France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Heinz KINDERMANN (PES, DE) for the Fisheries Committee is urging the Commission and the Member States to create appropriate conditions for the drafting of a Europe-wide cormorant population management plan.
Key points
Cormorants eat nothing but fish, requiring 400-600 g per day. They are opportunists in the sense that they do not have any preference for particular species of fish but eat whichever are easiest to catch in the waters where they are. They most commonly catch fish between 10 and 25 cm long, but can also catch and consume fish up to 60 cm long and 1 kg in weight.
When hunting, cormorants dive from the surface in a straight line and then pursue their prey, which they catch in their beaks and take to the surface. As highly colonial birds, cormorants mostly fly to hunting waters in relatively large flocks. Upon arrival they then normally each hunt individually, but often also hunt in groups ranging from 25 to several hundred birds, which first surround the fish, with the result that in some waters they are able to consume a high percentage of the fish population in a relatively short time. As cormorants are large, long-lived birds, which start to breed only at the age of three to five years, the total population in Europe is probably around (at least) 1.7 to 1.8 million birds. This large population has had a direct impact on local fish populations and on fishing in many areas of the European Union, so that the presence of cormorants has become a problem throughout Europe. Particularly serious are the losses of fish species which are already endangered, such as eel, grayling, nase and other species which spawn on gravel beds, as well as smolts.
Rapporteur Kindermann considers that, although primary responsibility in this field rests with Member States and their regional or local authorities, it has already been demonstrated that purely local and/or national measures are not capable of reducing for any length of time the impact of cormorants on European fish stocks and fishing. A common, legally binding approach which is accepted and applied throughout Europe would therefore not only be desirable but absolutely essential, he says.
The report:
• Calls on the Commission to submit a cormorant population management plan in several stages, seeking to integrate cormorant populations in the long term into the cultural landscape without jeopardising the objectives of the Wild Birds Directive and Natura 2000 as regards fish species and marine and freshwater ecosystems; urges the Commission and the Member States to create appropriate conditions for the drafting of a Europe-wide cormorant population management plan;
• Calls on the Commission to consider all the legal means at its disposal to reduce the negative effects of cormorant populations on fishing and aquaculture and to take into account, when developing its initiative for the promotion of aquaculture in Europe, the positive effects of a Europe-wide cormorant population management plan;
• Proposes that, by means of systematic monitoring of cormorant populations supported by the EU and the Member States, a reliable, generally recognised and annually updated database be drawn up on the development, size and geographical distribution of cormorant populations in Europe, with closer involvement on the part of fishery research institutes and fishery authorities;
• Calls on the Commission and the Member States to make some of the funds earmarked in the EU budget for data collection in the fisheries sector, in particular under heading 11 07 02: ‘Support for the management of fishery resources (improvement of scientific advice)’, available for investigations, analyses and forecasts of the cormorant population in the territory of the European Union, in preparation for the future regular monitoring of these species;
• Calls on the Commission to put out to tender, and finance, a scientific project aimed at supplying an estimation modal for the size and structure of the total cormorant population;
• Calls on the Commission to set up a working party with a binding mandate to carry out within one year a systematic cost-benefit analysis of possible cormorant management actions at Member State level, to assess their plausibility on the basis of logical and scientific criteria and to submit a recommendation. The composition of the working party should reflect the degree to which the stakeholders are affected.

EU strategy on Roma
2008-11-28 - 09:48
MEPs will debate the EU strategy on Roma after hearing statements from the Council and Commission. Roma communities in Europe – including those describing themselves as Roma, Gypsies, Travellers and Sinti – have long faced discrimination and persecution. With the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 to include new members in central and eastern Europe, the Roma population living in the EU now numbers several million. On 31 January, the European Parliament adopted a report warning of the risks of anti-Gypsyism promoted by extremists and calling for fresh efforts to integrate Roma through positive measures in housing, health, education and employment. Of the 12 to 15 million Roma living in Europe, about 10 million live in EU countries. The majority became EU citizens after the 2004 and 2007 enlargements. Yet MEPs believe Roma communities still suffer clear discrimination.
On 10 July, the European Parliament asked the Italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from Roma people, including children, and to put an end to discriminatory policies, in a resolution adopted on 10 July. MEPs also said the integration of Roma people should be ensured at European level. Council and Commission statements - EU strategy on Roma

Arms exports Code of Conduct
2008-11-28 - 09:48
The EU Code of Conduct on arms exports builds on the Common Criteria for arms exports adopted in 1991 and 1992 and also includes a denial notification and consultation mechanism, the first such mechanism ever applied to conventional arms exports. The adoption of the Code marked a qualitatively new stage in the EU's development of a common approach to arms exports as an important element of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. MEPs will debate arms exports and the EU Code of Contact following a statement from the Council. The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
All Member States have agreed to apply the Code of Conduct when assessing applications to export items listed in the agreed EU Common Military List. The Code of Conduct also aims to improve the sharing of information between Member States and to increase mutual understanding of their export control policies.

Preventing VAT fraud: yes to better data collection and exchange
2008-11-28 - 09:48
As part of a series of measures to help prevent VAT fraud, the Commission is proposing to accelerate the collection and exchange of data on intra-Community transactions, by having companies make monthly electronic statements of their data, as opposed to quarterly statements, often on paper, and imposing a one-month, rather than three month, deadline on Member States to share this information. The Economics Committee supports the proposal, with some amendments. Parliament will now debate and vote on two reports from José-Manuel Garcia Margallo (EPP-ED, ES) on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee covering different aspects of the proposals. While supporting the changes, the committee wants to clarify some procedural aspects, and ensure Member States publicise and share best practice.
The reports also make clear that the Commission should review the administrative burden of these arrangements after two years.
As usual with taxation policy, Parliament’s role is consultative and if the changes are to be adopted there will need to be unanimity in the Council.

Tackling VAT fraud: Administrative cooperation
2008-11-28 - 09:48
According to the European Court of Auditors, the UK is estimated to have lost €18.2bn in VAT revenue for the tax year 2005-06. Solid estimates of the actual volume of VAT fraud are still not available for all Member States. The report, drafted by Bart STAES (Greens, BE), acknowledges that the actual volume of VAT evasion and fraud is difficult to fully assess. It welcomes the Commission's study on VAT and tax fraud, expected to be finalised in 2008 and which "should provide reliable estimates". Overall the Budgetary Control Committee supports the Commission proposal on administrative cooperation for VAT, but is concerned that the "factual basis for the discussion is still incomplete."
Action by Member States may "trigger a displacement of VAT fraud"
The committee also urges the Commission and Council to give "higher priority" to the development of a common approach and to assess whether measures taken by Member States against VAT evasion and fraud are successful, or a mere trigger for the displacement of VAT fraud to other economic sectors or Member States.
The report expresses concern on the Court's findings that some Member States basic requirements for effective cooperation were missing. The Court found that almost half of requests for information from one Member State to another were not answered within the current three-month deadline; central liaison offices (CLO), which are the main channels for information exchange, contributed to delays; and significant differences exist between the number of requests for information claimed to have been received by Member States and the number of requests claimed to have been sent by Member States.
As such, the Committee calls on the Council to solve the problem of discrepancy in the number of requests sent and received "as a matter of urgency".
Eurocanet's efficiency reduced
While Eurocanet (European Carousel Network), a system founded in Belgium for improving the spontaneous exchange of information, enables tax administrators to detect VAT fraud quicker, its efficiency is reduced because the UK, Germany and Italy do not participate.
Commission to be central coordinator
In conclusion, the report presses Member States to "step up their efforts to better exploit the potential of administrative cooperation under the current legal framework", calls on the Council to explore how the Commission's role as a central coordinator of administrative cooperation could be enhanced, and calls for links between the administrative and judicial cooperation to be clarified.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Gender inequality and human trafficking in the Balkans
2008-11-28 - 09:48
The process of democratic stabilisation is on its way in the Balkans, but there is still a lot of work to be done, particularly with regard to women's rights, says the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. The report, drafted by Zita GURMAI (PSE, HU), evaluates the current situation of women in the areas of employment, health and the democratisation process in the candidate countries Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the potential candidate countries Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo.
Women can play a leading role in political and economic stabilisation
It considers that although women in these countries can play a leading role in the continuation of political and economic stabilisation and in the creation of democratic institutions, equal opportunities are not being granted to them and gender equality laws and practices are not being guaranteed.
Women in the Balkans should "no longer be seen only as war victims but rather as actors of stabilisation and conflict resolution", the report says, stressing they can only fulfil this role if equally represented in the political and economic decision-making. In light of this, MEPs of the Women's Rights Committee calls on countries that have not already done so to effectively apply quotas in political and national assemblies to ensure that women participate in political life.
Balkans used for human trafficking
The report notes "with anxiety" that the aforementioned countries are "transit" countries in the process of trafficking in human beings and that generally women and children are the victims of the trafficking." It stresses that gender equality, awareness-raising campaigns, the work of NGOs and measures against corruption and organised crime are "essential" in the prevention of this "negative phenomena" in the Balkan countries.
Commission asked to provide pre-accession funds
The Committee calls on the Commission to provide pre-accession funds for strengthening women's rights in the Balkans, in particular through women's NGOs and women's organisations.
It also urges the European Institute for Gender Equality to monitor gender equality in the countries of the Balkans with special attention on candidate countries. Rapporteur Zita GURMAI PES HU A6-0435/2008 The situation of women in the Balkans Procedure : own-initiative

Cooperation agreement between EU and South Korea to stop anti-competitive behaviour
2008-11-28 - 09:48
Noting that competition law between the European Community and South Korea is the most efficient way to tackle anti-competitive behaviour, the Committee on International Trade considers that the Korea-EC Agreement, concluded in early 2008, should be considered in the context of the overall framework of existing agreements between the European Community and the Republic of Korea and those currently under negotiation, in particular the negotiations concerning a potential free trade agreement. The Parliament's resolution of 13 December 2007 on trade and economic relations with Korea stated that a wide ranging, ambitious and well balanced agreement could produce significant benefits for each side. However, it is also important that this Agreement, which seeks to combat anti-competitive practices, "should form part of broad, balanced package of agreements between the EU and Korea that would also cover cooperation on issues such as the promotion of social and environmental standards", the report says.
Trade Defence Instruments no longer needed
Moreover, considering that the EU and South Korea have decided to mutually recognise each others' competition laws, the use of trade defence instruments (TDIs) between the two parties should become "obsolete", the report drafted by David MARTIN (PES, UK) argues.
TDIs are used to tackle anti-competitive behaviour when competition laws are lacking or are not mutually recognised. "This cooperation agreement should mean that the EU and South Korea recognise each others' laws and authorities", it says.
Fourth largest non-European trading partner
Korea is the EU’s fourth largest non-European trading partner and the EU is Korea’s largest foreign investor. Given the growing importance of this partnership, it seems appropriate that Korea should be added to the three other partners with which the EC has agreements concerning cooperation on anti-competitive activities.

Judicial cooperation
Council regulation on maintenance claims will simplify the lives of EU citizens
2008-11-28 - 09:48
A Council regulation, which aims to eliminate legal obstacles surrounding maintenance claims within the EU, welcomed by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, will make decisions on maintenance obligations made in one Member State legally binding in another. The regulation has been the source of a lengthy term of debates. Currently, the average maintenance claim in the EU is estimated to be around €4,000 a year. In the UK, 70% of child support maintenance is considered to be "probably uncollectable". The report drafted by Genowefa GRABOWSKA (PES, PL) says the regulation, which will enforce an operational system of cooperation between the central authorities of the Member States, will "result in simplifying the lives of citizens".
No amendments made to the proposal
The adoption of a convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance in November, 2007, by the Hague Conference on Private International Law led to a Council agreement on 21 October, 2008, which corresponded with the views of Parliament. The Civil Liberties Committee report makes no amendments to the proposal for regulation on maintenance obligations, but asks that the Council consults Parliament again if it intends to substantially amend the text for consultation. Rapporteur Genowefa GRABOWSKA PES PL A6-0456/2008 Judicial cooperation in civil matters: jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations Debate : 04.12.2008
