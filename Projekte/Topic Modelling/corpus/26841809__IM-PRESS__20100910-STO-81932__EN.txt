"Congratulations - you've won over â‚¬100 in Prizes!" can often not be quite as clear as it looks... MEPs want action on false adverts Fake prizes & dubious cures to fall under stronger scrutiny Like most you've probably won many "prizes" in your life which you never received, purchased goods "because it was the very last opportunity at this price" and maybe bought health remedies that never worked. How many times have you fallen victim to unfair commercial practices? What was the "smartest" move ever tried on you? Yesterday the members of the Internal Market Committee looked into the topic of unfair commercial practices in advertising.
Among the sharp and unfair practices identified are for products that falsely claim to be able to cure illnesses, selling products that cannot be legally sold, awarding prizes falsely and claiming that a trader is about to cease trading or move premises when actually he is not.
The non-legislative report by French centre right European People's Party Member Philippe Juvin looks at the effectiveness and enforcement of the existing directive concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices. It also identifies problems with certain practices on the internet related to misleading advertising like hidden advertising through blogs, forums, websites, and targeted advertising. Mr Juvin presented his report to fellow members of the Committee Monday 13 September.
Power to the consumer
The report examines possible remedies in help the consumer "develop a critical attitude to the quality of media content". It asks the European Commission (which governs advertising rules) to devise information campaigns on consumer rights and to develop educational material explaining how consumers can protect their privacy on the internet. It also wants the words "behavioural advertisement" in relevant online advertisements and an analysis of the impact of misleading and aggressive advertising on children. The report also calls on the Commission to develop an EU advertising literacy programme for children.
Who can help me if I think I've been cheated?
The Commission has set up a special website on unfair commercial practices, presenting a black list of the practices and offering advice on how to get help.
Step 1 Seek advice - Confirm that your complaint is valid according to the law and that you have been a victim of an unfair commercial practice. It's best to contact your national consumer association or one of the advice centres of the ECC-Net to get their advice.
Step 2 File a complaint - Your national consumer protection authorities decide on complaints or to initiate appropriate legal proceedings. Based on your national laws, these authorities or the courts can order the cessation of the unfair commercial practices.
