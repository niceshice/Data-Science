Post-Briefing - 30-31 January 2008 - Brussels plenary session
2008-02-01 - 13:46
Selected highlights from the Brussels plenary session 30-31 January 2008 include:
Pöttering welcomes Slovenian and Maltese parliaments ratification of Treaty of Lisbon
Opening the plenary session in Brussels, the President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering welcomed the fact that the Slovenian and Maltese parliaments have now ratified the Lisbon Treaty, following on from Hungary. He pointed out that the Maltese parliament had done this unanimously.
Postal services liberalisation: MEPs back market opening by 2011
The European Parliament confirms that remaining postal service monopolies should expire by 2011 - or 2013 for some Member States. In a second reading deal with Council, the European Parliament sticks to the compromise already endorsed by the Council on the opening up of EU postal services to competition.
European Parliament "calls on Iran to restore the transparency of its nuclear programme"
In a resolution adopted in plenary, MEPs regret that Iran "has still not complied with its international obligations to suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities." The House also expresses its deep concern about a whole range of human rights issues in the country.
Gaza : MEPs paint a picture of despair
Many MEPs on Wednesday (30 January) deplored the dire straits that drove Gazans to breach the wall around the Gaza strip, after an Israeli blockade lasting several weeks. The EU's alignment with US policy in the region was criticized by several MEPs in a plenary debate with EU foreign policy High Representative Javier Solana and external relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. Vote on a resolution will take place during the February plenary in Strasbourg.
MEPs highlight "ghettoisation" of Roma and call for EU anti-discrimination measures
The European Parliament adopted a report warning of the risks of anti-Gypsyism promoted by extremists and calling for fresh efforts to integrate Roma through positive measures in housing, health, education and employment. Of the 12 to 15 million Roma living in Europe, about 10 million live in EU countries. The majority became EU citizens after the 2004 and 2007 enlargements. Yet MEPs believe Roma communities still suffer clear discrimination.
MEPs call for withdrawal of patio heaters from the market in energy efficiency report
MEPs backed the Commission's proposed Action Plan for Energy Efficiency in adopting an own-initiative report. It says both the Commission and Member States need to improve their implementation of energy-efficiency legislation. MEPs urge the Commission to establish timetables for the withdrawal from the market of all the least energy-efficient items of equipment, appliances and other energy-using products, such as patio heaters.
Improving police cooperation among EU countries in crisis situations
MEPs adopted a report giving their strong support to an Austrian initiative to improve cooperation between the special police intervention units of EU countries in crisis situations. The report gives its non-binding approval to the Council initiative and proposes few amendments to clarify concepts such as what is a "crisis situation" or how can Member States cooperate. The report was adopted with 558 votes in favour, 56 against and 10 abstentions.
MEPs adopt simplified regime for the control of visas in Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus
The European parliament gave the go-ahead for an extension of simplified controls of visas at the external frontiers of Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus. This system will enable these Member States to recognise unilaterally certain documents issued by Schengen zone countries for third country nationals making visits of less than five days.
Attract researchers and stop the brain drain, say MEPs
The EU has to re-attract competent researchers and prevent a further outflow from the EU, says the European Parliament in its own-initiative report on the European Research Area adopted with 602 votes in favour, 18 against and 6 abstentions. MEPs call on Member States to abolish any barriers that hinder researchers from entering the EU. They also propose a "research voucher" and postdoctoral fellowships which build on the Erasmus programme to increase researchers' mobility within the EU.
Positive and negative incentives for the industry to eliminate discards
Parliament adopted a report (616 votes in favour to 22 against, with amendments) reacting to the Commission communication "A policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards in European fisheries". According to MEPs, the most sensible way to proceed is by choosing a number of pilot fisheries, based upon the quantity of discards produced or on the conservation status of the species involved.
Statistics on aquaculture production to be improved in the EU
In a world in which fish stocks are declining and world demand for fish and seafood is constantly rising, aquaculture is becoming increasingly important. MEPs adopted a co-decision report by 599 votes in favour to 9 against and 17 abstentions drawn up by Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR) on a proposal aiming to replace the current Community legislation on the submission by Member States of statistics on aquaculture production, which has been in force for more than ten years. 20080129BRI19892

Opening of the Brussels plenary: Pöttering welcomes Slovenian and Maltese parliaments ratification of Treaty of Lisbon
2008-02-01 - 13:46
Opening the plenary session in Brussels, the President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering welcomed the fact that the Slovenian and Maltese parliaments have now ratified the Lisbon Treaty, following on from Hungary. He pointed out that the Maltese parliament had done this unanimously. Mr Pöttering welcomed the rapid ratification recalling that the Treaty should be implemented by 1 January 2009. President Pöttering recalled that Slovakia had delayed its ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon "for internal reasons" and underlined that all Slovakian politicians have a responsibility in this matter.
New debate on the situation in Gaza - vote on a resolution in February
MEPs voted in favour of adding a debate with statements by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission on the situation in Gaza. The House will vote on a resolution on this topic during its plenary session 18-21 February 2008.
The debate took place on Wednesday, 30 January 2008.

Postal services liberalisation: MEPs back market opening by 2011
2008-02-01 - 13:46
The European Parliament confirms that remaining postal service monopolies should expire by 2011 - or 2013 for some Member States. In a second reading deal with Council, the European Parliament sticks to the compromise already endorsed by the Council on the opening up of EU postal services to competition. In its common position, the Council had incorporated all major elements of the European Parliament's position at first reading. The European Parliament approved the common position without amendments.
Opening up of the market by 2011 or 2013
Among the key points was the date for market opening: by 2011, two years later than the Commission had proposed, with the possibility for Member States which joined the EU after 2004 or with a difficult topography, such as Greece to postpone market opening by a further two years to 2013. The following Member States may postpone implementation until the end of 2012: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. For Luxembourg, the Council agreed with the European Parliament first-reading position which said that Member States that acceded to the EU after the entry into force of Directive 2002/39/EC or Member States with a small population and limited geographical size could postpone to 2013.
Situation in the UK and Ireland
The market in the UK is fully liberalised. There are now seventeen licensed operators in the UK, and these new market entrants are playing a crucial role in sustaining the mails market as a medium of communication.
Liberalisation in Ireland has already commenced and since the transposition of the Directives, the weight limit applying to postal items falling within the reserved area (and therefore not open to competition) has been reduced to 50g from 1 January 2006 with a price limit of two and a half times the basic tariff (currently 55c) for domestic and inbound international. Outbound international mail was fully liberalised on 1 January 2004. The parcels market is already fully liberalised. To date Ireland has adopted a light regulatory approach to liberalisation so as to encourage and maximise the number of postal operators that might wish to enter the market. Competition in the sector is growing and at present there are 31 firms operating in Ireland with a postal service authorisation from the regulator. It is anticipated that with full market opening, many more operators will enter the market, leading to a competitive, vibrant sector.
A letter delivered and collected every day
The text makes clear that, in a liberalised market, letters should go on being both delivered and collected at least once a day, at least five days a week, for every EU citizen, in remote areas as well as cities. The funding for these universal services should be guaranteed if market players prove unable to provide such services profitably. In that case, Member States may decide to set up compensation funds.
The principle of reciprocity
MEPs also agree with Council on the principle of reciprocity: in order to avoid market distortion and unfair competition, those Member States having opened their markets should be able to refuse authorisation to operators still protected by a national monopoly in another Member State.
Safeguards for postal staff
Social considerations should be taken into account in this process of market opening, say MEPs. Member States will be able to reflect working conditions in their authorisation procedures. They will also have the right to impose conditions on the supply of postal services for non-economic reasons, such as compliance with employment conditions and social security schemes, where these are laid down in law or by a collective agreement negotiated between national social partners.
Not enough support for amendment on the blind and free services
An amendment proposed by Richard Howitt (PES, UK, Eastern, Labour) and others did not gain enough support to be included in the legislation. It read: "Given the importance of postal services for blind and partially sighted persons, it is appropriate to confirm that in a competitive and liberalised market there should be an obligation to supply free services for blind and partially sighted persons introduced by the Member States."

External relations
European Parliament "calls on Iran to restore the transparency of its nuclear programme"
2008-02-01 - 13:46
In a resolution adopted in plenary, MEPs regret that Iran "has still not complied with its international obligations to suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities." The House also expresses its deep concern about a whole range of human rights issues in the country. MEPs welcome "the agreement reached [...] in Berlin on 22 January 2008 on a new draft resolution on Iran which foresees further measures and the fact that the international community maintains a common approach to the issue." They call on "the US Administration and all other actors involved to renounce all rhetoric on military options and regime change policies against Iran," and call on the US to "participate directly in negotiations with Iran along with the EU."
Human Rights
The EP "expresses its deep concern over the deterioration of the human rights situation in Iran." It "strongly condemns the death sentences and executions in Iran, in particular those imposed and/or carried out on juvenile offenders and minors," and is "deeply concerned about the dramatic increase in the repression of civil-society movements." The House in particular "protests vehemently the execution of Zamal Bawi," who was executed just a few hours before the vote.
The House "strongly condemns the current disrespect for minority rights," and "condemns the repression against political opponents, human rights defenders, journalists, web loggers, teachers, intellectuals, women, students, trade unionists, and persons belonging to religious, ethnic, linguistic or other minorities."
EU-Iran Relations
MEPs underline that "the possible future conclusion of a Cooperation and Trade Agreement between Iran and the EU depends on a substantial improvement in Iran's human rights situation as well as on Iran's full cooperation with the IAEA."
Debate: Wednesday, 30 January 2008
MEPs debate the situation in Iran with Javier Solana
The EP debated the situation in Iran after hearing a statement from the High Representative Javier Solana and European Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. The House will vote on a resolution on this topic on Thursday. In the draft proposed resolution, MEPs regret that Iran "has still not complied with its international obligations to suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities." The House also expressed its deep concern about a whole range of human rights issues in the country.
The need for cautious engagement with Iran was the keynote of the opening speech by CFSP High Representative Javier SOLANA, who told the House that Iran was "one of the most important issues on the international community's agenda today" as well as "a key country in the Middle East. "The EU would therefore like a constructive relationship with Iran - but we have difficulty in achieving this", he acknowledged.
Politically, he said, Iran has "elements of democracy that are not visible in other Middle East countries". It is "an imperfect democracy" but this is better than nothing so "we should engage with its parliamentarians". However, Iran has high numbers of executions, reports of torture persist and "press freedom is one of the lowest in the world". Since 2004 Iran has been unwilling to participate in the human rights dialogue with the EU.
Energy, drug trafficking and counter-terrorism were areas on which the EU would like to cooperate with Iran but it was difficult to see the country as a constructive partner. On Palestine, Iran was "the only country in the Middle East not to accept the two-state solution" and was also sending arms to Hamas, as well as to Hezbollah in Lebanon and was also fuelling violence in Iraq. On Afghanistan, however, "cooperation has been fruitful".
Turning to the issue of Iran's nuclear programme, Mr Solana said "were it to develop a nuclear weapon, radical instability would result", which would "damage the whole non-proliferation system". He added "our objective is to remove suspicions, which can only be achieved through a negotiated solution". Iran must approve the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty.
On the question of uranium enrichment, when the Iranians are asked about their intentions, why they needed enriched uranium "the question is never answered", said the High Representative. He added "None of us have a problem with an Iranian civil programme, in fact, we are offering to help" but "we need to ensure that their intentions are purely peaceful". The aim of a new UN Security Council resolution was "not to punish Iran but to bring it to the negotiating table".
More broadly, said Mr Solana, "we need to find ways of reassuring countries that they can get nuclear fuel without developing their own enrichment capacities" and he proposed "a world fuel bank" for this purpose.
In conclusion, he said that he had tried for years to normalise relations with Iran and would continue to do so because this would "benefit the people of the EU and of Iran".
European Commission
External Relations Commissioner Benita FERRERO-WALDNER said that in the current climate it was inevitable that discussions on Iran would focus on the nuclear programme. "The international community is united on this," she said, united that is in supporting the efforts of the UN, IAEA and Javier Solana. "International unity is central and it was shown at last meeting in Berlin. When I received Jalili last week, I recalled the EU's principled position. No-one has denied Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy, but was a serious need to rebuild trust." The EU, she said was showing it was willing to improve relations, but the political will was absent on the Iranian side. "Until it is there, we cannot enhance our relationship by restarting talks on a trade and cooperation agreement or on energy relations."
The Commissioner said she was confident Parliament shared her views and she praised the Parliament's delegation for its recent visit to Tehran which included meetings with high officials, but also various representatives of wider Iranian society. Such meetings were, she said, "an important testimony of importance EU attaches to fully free and pluralistic Iran, in accordance with international conventions it has freely signed up to."
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner added that people to people contacts are an excellent means to overcome misunderstandings and stereotypes. She was therefore particularly please that the first batch of Iranian students and academics were studying in Europe under the "external cooperation window" of the Erasmus Mundus scheme. She hope Europeans would also study in Iran.
She also mentioned the EU's grants programme which aimed to support non-state actors and local authorities in developing an inclusive and empowered society, and welcomed Parliament's approval for €3 million to fund a Farsi language TV news service with a strong European angle.
Finally, she turned to the central issue of human rights. "In front of this Parliament Mr Jalili last week insisted on the importance of human dignity. Of course I agree with that, but when I spoke to him, I could only relay my deep concern at deterioration of human rights situation." 297 executions had taken place in 2007, she said, a sharp increase on the previous year. This was without considering the cruel methods of killing people. She hoped that EU-Iran human rights dialogue could resume, and also called for a wider spectrum of candidates than in the past for the upcoming elections. "Without systematic improvement on human rights situation our relations with Iran cannot develop properly," she concluded.
Political group speakers
Michael GAHLER (DE) for the EPP-ED group, referred both to the nuclear issue and to human rights. He stressed the EP's longstanding firm stance against executions and torture, and named a number of Iranian activists facing death sentences, calling for executions not to be carried out.
"Mr Jaliili did not give us a clear statement last week on the nuclear issue. He gave only a cursory response to a series of detailed questions from MEPs. This did nothing to overcome the lack of confidence on this issue." He said such non-answers would only lead to greater resolution by the international community. Agreement at the UN on a new draft Security Council resolution was therefore welcome, all the more so for including Russia and China in the consensus. "We need dialogue, but we need to make a clear stand in favour of human rights, and in favour of more cooperation once trust is restored," he said.
For the Socialist group, Hannes SWOBODA (AT), agreed that human rights, nuclear weapons and free elections were the key issues. "I agree with the High Representative that we do not want nuclear weapons there or anywhere else in the region." He said it was scandalous that the United States had turned a blind eye to Pakistan's nuclear weapons, which had led to the technology leaking to other countries. "We need to ensure the controls on enrichment and production are multilateralised," he said.
Mr Swoboda added that democracy was only meaningful if there were genuinely free elections. If President Ahmadinejad had the broad based support he claimed, he should put this to the test in a free election. Free elections were needed across the whole region.
Speaking for the ALDE group, Annemie NEYTS-UYTTEBROECK (BE) said that the debate with Iranian chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili did not achieve good results. Ms Neyts stressed their was cross-party support on stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and conducting nuclear research that would lead to Iran obtaining nuclear weapons. However, development of nuclear power for civil use, she said, should be put under international control.
"The most important and pressing matter is that this country doesn't develop nuclear weapons," said Konrad SZYMAŃSKI (UEN, PL). On the basis of the National intelligence estimate, one could not be sure that the country is not pursuing them. "We need to continue putting pressure on Iran, and not rule out military intervention," he said.
"What we need now is a moratorium on the nuclear issue", said Tobias PFLÜGER (GUE/NGL, DE). He continued that "I am against making the sanctions worse because that would be counter productive." He also opposes a war in Iran: "There is still a threat of war hanging over Iran, my group is clearly against any threat of war or planning of war."
It should be clear that today's debate "will be heard in Iran because it is a wide awake plural society eager to get hold of information," said Angelika BEER (Greens/EFA, DE). "Sanctions will weaken the civil society and bolster Ahmadinejad ... we won't have a political solution if we take that end." She continued that "we have to show our solidarity with society, women, trade unions, everybody under threat."
Bastiaan BELDER (IND/DEM, NL) said there was good news and bad news from Iran. The good news is that "Iran's opposition is not behind Ahmadinejad's statements on the Holocaust." The bad news is that Iran has said it would have serious consequences if the UN Security Council Resolution is passed. Mr Belder underlined that "we should be bolstering the role of the IAEA."
Philip CLAEYS (NI, BE) stressed that the regime in "Iran is and remains a threat to stability in the Middle East as a whole and for other parts of the world." Iran should be isolated in the region, including from Russia. Iran's involvement in international Islamic terrorism was proven and "it would be wrong to reduce the pressure on the Iranian president."
Javier Solana replies to political group speakers
Replying to the first round of speakers, Mr Solana identified three main areas of concern which it was hard to discuss with Iran: human rights and democracy, regional politics and the nuclear issue.
On the upcoming elections, he noted that many of the 30% of candidates who have been barred from standing for election are the most "modern" in outlook.
Regarding the Middle East peace process, he felt "Iran must become a constructive player". However, "we believe in a two-state solution, they don't. We need to see how we can move forward".
As to the nuclear question, Mr Solana told the House that "the outstanding issues have never been resolved". Iran is a signatory to the NPT and so it "has obligations". And pointing out that Iran has no plans and no contract for the construction of a nuclear power plant, even though it would take 7-8 years to come into use, he said "so if they continue enrichment, the question remains why they are doing so?" Tellingly, "we still have not had a good answer".
British speakers who participated in the debate
Baroness NICHOLSON OF WINTERBOURNE (ALDE, Liberal Democrat, South East, UK) stated that she believed "there are huge possibilities for dialogue" but not just on human rights and on the all-important nuclear issue. She said she believed we should be having dialogue on cultural issues, music, art, archaeology - all of those issues - painting, calligraphy - in which we share so much historical reference and so much potential for future gain.
Baroness Nicholson also believed that one critical item that should be discussed is this so-called barrier between Islam and the democracy. "Perhaps it has not been noticed that the Islamic Republic of Iran believes that it has cracked that particular difficulty, and that her form of democracy is fully comprehensible with the Islamic Republic of Iran's version of Islam, the all-important Sharia law and the Shiite Islamic tradition. I think this, again, is something that we should welcome and should discuss this very year, perhaps with President Khatami or with other members of the Iranian religious influence and tradition."
Gerard BATTEN (IND/DEM, UK, UKIP, London) stated that "Iran plans to build 5000 more centrifuges. Meanwhile illegal secret imports of raw uranium arrive from the Congo, a country the EU supports with humanitarian aid. Britain still allows Iranian students to study nuclear physics at our universities. In addition to this, Iran, Syria and North Korea are working together to assemble missiles and chemical warheads.
Whether or not these countries successfully develop nuclear warheads, Mr Batten warned that "chemical warheads would certainly be deployable in the near future.
Struan STEVENSON (EPP-ED, Scotland, Conservative, UK) questioned if "we are training their nuclear physicists in our universities? Are we, at our taxpayers’ expense, paying for poverty relief in one of the richest oil-producing nations in the world because they have chosen to spend billions on a nuclear weapons programme? What has our policy of appeasement achieved?" Mr Stevenson stated that " 23 people were executed in the first two weeks of this year, including several women. Five people had their hands or feet amputated. Men and women continue to be stoned to death by this Jihadist, misogynous, homophobic, genocidal, brutal regime which is a world sponsor of terror."
"If we wish really to support Iranian students, we should support the brave students of Tehran University, who have been demonstrating for the past five days, demanding regime change. Instead of backing appeasement, we should back the legitimate Iranian Opposition. Instead of keeping the PMOI on our terror list, we should put the revolutionary guards of Iran on the EU terror list."
Charles TANNOCK (EPP-ED, London, Conservative, UK) stated that "Iran remains a danger to the stability of the world and the Middle East. Iranian Jihadis are fighting alongside terrorists in Iraq, killing British soldiers. Iran's judges routinely pass death sentences on homosexuals and teenagers."
Our message must be clear and uncompromising, Mr Tannock stated - "Iran will not be allowed by the international community to arm itself with nuclear weapons."
European Commission response
In her response to the debate, Benita Ferrero-Waldner said there was a huge civil society in Iran that would like to have a different way of life, but there was a very difficult regime. The nuclear issue was the chief obstacle to improving relations between the EU and Iran. "We need to appeal to the population to see that there is a chance to change things at the next elections, although it will be difficult," It was good, she said, to see there was some greater unity in the Iranian opposition, but the screening of candidates issue was crucial. Too many candidates had already been put aside. "I strongly hope that an appeals procedure will redress the situation. The Iranian electorate deserves to be able to choose from a wide spectrum of candidates." She added that there was no question of the EU supporting any candidate in particular.
She agreed with those MEPs who had said there was a need to work on human rights even if no progress on nuclear issues. The EU had supported moves on human rights in the UN by Canada. She noted that the EIDHR programme was already being used in Iran. But a proposal to have one diplomat in one of the Member States' embassies in Iran to coordinate joint projects had so far not been given approval by Iran - Mrs Ferrero-Waldner had put this question directly to Mr Jalili the week before, but had received no answer.

Gaza : MEPs paint a picture of despair
2008-02-01 - 13:46
Many MEPs on Wednesday (30 January) deplored the dire straits that drove Gazans to breach the wall around the Gaza strip, after an Israeli blockade lasting several weeks. The EU's alignment with US policy in the region was criticized by several MEPs in a plenary debate with EU foreign policy High Representative Javier Solana and external relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. "I believe that we face a very difficult situation, because in the Middle East, everything is linked. If we cannot progress towards a solution to the current problem in Gaza, then the peace process will be placed in difficulty" said Javier Solana.
Benita Ferrero-Waldner reiterated that she had expressed "cautious optimism" after the November 1997 Ananapolis conference, "knowing how difficult it would be to launch the bilateral negotiations between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas" she said, adding that "we then had what I would call a very successful pledging conference in Paris, where we saw so much support that we thought there was now real new momentum". The Commissioner felt that the EU should now act as "facilitators", but not necessarily "mediators".
It was "despair" that drove the Gazans to breach the wall, said José Ignacio Salafranca (EPP-ED, ES). "Whereas, two years ago, we celebrating the holding of free elections in Palestine, we now see the Palestinian cause fragmenting", he said, on behalf of his group. Mr Salafranca also criticized Israel for taking advantage of this division "to continue settlements and impose a blockade". He stressed the necessity of "backing the High Representative's efforts, supporting the Naples conference line through the Quartet and moderate Arab countries, and, above all, (…) and focusing Europe's action on preventing pointless human suffering (…), which has gone on too long in the Middle East".
"Eventually, every wall falls: the wall of Jericho, that of the Warsaw ghetto, the Berlin wall, the Atlantic wall, or the wall of indifference. The Rafah wall's symbolic weight makes it part of man's blind drive towards freedom", declared Véronique de Keyser (PES, BE). "Our responsibility, today, is historic. The question is no longer who will open the doors of this open-air prison, but who will dare close them, who will dare return the Gazans to their slow asphyxia. From the start of Annapolis, the European Union lost its grip. On the basis of the roadmap, it handed control of the peace process to the USA", she stressed.
"As a member of Parliament’s delegation to the Palestinian Legislative Council, I have been trying to work out why, when we call for an end to settlement building, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing. Why, when we call for the removal of the checkpoints, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing. Why, when we call to an end to the collective punishment of people in Gaza, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing", said Chris Davies (ALDE, UK), who then went on to reveal that the reason why, supplied at the previous day's delegation meeting by EU Special Representative to the Middle East Marc Otte, was that "our policy - Europe's policy - is to follow the leadership given by America".
"The Palestinian people will believe in peace when peace brings them something" said Daniel Cohn-Bendit (Greens/EFA, DE). "Peace is not abstract. Peace is concrete. That is why we must say to Israel 'the blockade is something that makes life unbearable for Palestinians, and so endangers Israel's security'. That's the truth! And we need to say to Mr Bush: 'In any event, you will be gone within months. So be quiet, and leave policy making to others, who have grasped the situation better!'".
"The heroes of Gaza have proven once again that no fortified wall can imprison the free spirit of humanity and no form of violence can subdue life", said French MEP Francis Wurtz for the GUE/NGL group, quoting a statement made at the gates of Gaza the previous Saturday by Israeli peace campaigner and Sakharov prize winner Mrs Nurit Peled. Mr Wurtz stressed that "anyone can see the dual danger emerging on the side of the Israeli leadership. The first is the desire forcibly to close, or have closed, this narrow space of freedom. The second, more generally, is to pass off on to Egypt the responsibility of being the occupying power vis-à-vis Gaza". Vote on resolution : February plenary session (18-21 Feb 08)

MEPs highlight "ghettoisation" of Roma and call for EU anti-discrimination measures
2008-02-01 - 13:46
The European Parliament adopted a report warning of the risks of anti-Gypsyism promoted by extremists and calling for fresh efforts to integrate Roma through positive measures in housing, health, education and employment. Of the 12 to 15 million Roma living in Europe, about 10 million live in EU countries. The majority became EU citizens after the 2004 and 2007 enlargements. Yet MEPs believe Roma communities still suffer clear discrimination. "Anti-Gypsyism or Romaphobia is still widespread in Europe and is promoted and used by extremists, which can culminate in racist attacks, hate speech, physical attacks, unlawful evictions and police harassment", warn MEPs in an own-initiative report adopted by 510 votes to 36, with 67 abstentions. The situation of European Roma communities is distinct from other national minorities, they say, arguing that this justifies specific measures at European level. Highlighting the "lack of progress made in combating racial discrimination against the Roma" in Europe, the resolution points out that, in the negotiation and accession process, all candidate countries committed to improving the inclusion of this community. It asks "the European Commission to make an assessment of the implementation of those commitments and of the current situation of the Roma in all EU Member States".
Parliament also maintains that "the Romani holocaust (Porajmos) deserves full recognition commensurate with the gravity of Nazi crimes" and, among many other measures, calls on the relevant authorities "to abolish the pig fattening industry on the former concentration camp in Lety (Czech Republic) and to create a memorial to honour the victims of persecution".
Housing
MEPs believe that "evidence of ghettoisation exist on a wide scale", with Roma regularly being either victims of forced evictions or prevented from moving out of such neighbourhoods. The Commission should therefore support active programmes to end Romani slums and provide housing for Roma citizens. Parliament also urged Member States to solve the problem of camps, "where there are no hygienic and safety standards at all and where a large number of Romani children die in domestic accidents, particularly fires".
Health
Member States need to improve the health situation of Roma communities, say MEPs, and "remedy without delay the systemic exclusion" of certain Roma communities from health care. In addition, "extreme human rights abuses (...) including racial segregation in health facilities and coercive sterilisation of Romani women" must be ended.
Education
Deploring the fact that segregation in education is still tolerated in the Member States, MEPs call on the Commission to look for new ways of tightening up anti-discrimination legislation in this field and to report back to the EP within one year. They believe positive action is needed in most areas of education and vocational training.
Employment
The Roma community also suffers "unacceptably high levels of unemployment", according to the resolution. The Commission is urged to support the integration of the Roma into the labour market through training, retraining and other measures, and also to consider granting micro-credits to Roma to help them start up small businesses.
Go local
While the EU and the Member States have crucial roles to play in key policy areas, MEPs also stress the need to involve local authorities in all active measures to integrate the Roma.
Measures within the European Commission
Lastly, MEPs urge the Commission to "shape a Community Action Plan on Roma Inclusion", to give one Commissioner "responsibility for coordinating a Roma policy" and "to promote Roma staff within its structure". Text adopted by the EP on a European strategy on the Roma

MEPs call for withdrawal of patio heaters from the market in energy efficiency report
2008-02-01 - 13:46
MEPs back the Commission's proposed Action Plan for Energy Efficiency in adopting an own-initiative report. It says both the Commission and Member States need to improve their implementation of energy-efficiency legislation. MEPs urge the Commission to establish timetables for the withdrawal from the market of all the least energy-efficient items of equipment, appliances and other energy-using products, such as patio heaters. The report was adopted with 592 votes in favour, 26 against and 30 abstentions. MEPs back the report from Fiona HALL (ALDE, UK Liberal Democrat North East), underlining their support for the Action Plan's aim of "improving energy efficiency by over 20% by 2020."
Speaking in the debate in Brussels on 30 January Fiona Hall said: "On appliances, Parliament’s report welcomes the proposal to put in place minimum energy performance requirements coupled with a dynamic system of energy labelling, to keep up with advances in technology. But our report calls on the Commission to come forward with a one-watt performance requirement for standby, and to carry out an analysis of the potential energy savings to be made from eliminating standby altogether. Our report also urges the Commission to set a timetable for taking completely off the market some very energy-inefficient items of equipment, such as patio heaters."
Avril Doyle (Fine Gael, East, EPP-ED, IE) said: "Parliament's report has been rightly critical of both the Commission and Member States for not doing more to implement existing energy-efficiency legislation. This pressure has resulted in the Commissioner augmenting his staff in the area of energy efficiency; underscoring the priority the Commission is finally giving to energy efficiency in order to contribute to a reduction of our CO2 emissions and to help tackle the critical issue of climate change."
The European Parliament considers that a target of improving energy efficiency by over 20% by 2020, in addition to any improvements due to autonomous structural or price effects, is entirely feasible technically and economically, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that this objective as well as the climate change targets are met.
Major points from the report, which were adopted in plenary by the European Parliament's, include:
The need for speedy adoption of energy performance standards for key products already agreed, such as air conditioning, boilers, TV set-top boxes;
A call for phasing out of inefficient light bulbs, and of patio heaters. Also the introduction of a 'one-watt' stand-by performance requirement and the ending of non-essential stand-by mode;
Criticism for EU governments which have yet to implement the existing Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (only 5 out of 27 countries implemented it in time);
A call for all new and renovated buildings to be included in a revision of the Buildings Directive from 2009 (rather than keeping the existing 1000m2 threshold);
Criticism for EU Member States which have still to present their Energy Efficiency National Action Plans.
The House also notes with grave concern that implementation by Member States of existing legislation on energy efficiency is incomplete and behind schedule.
Drastic cuts in carbon emissions are necessary to prevent chaotic climate change, says the House, and "the most immediate and cost-effective way of achieving them is to use energy more efficiently" - which is precisely what the Action Plan for Energy Efficiency intends to ensure. More efficient energy use, MEPs note, would also reduce the EU's dependency on energy imports. The House also backs the Plan's scope and key objectives: to provide EU citizens with the most energy-efficient infrastructure, buildings, appliances, processes, transport means and energy systems, as well as to encourage citizens to use energy in the most rational manner possible.
Inadequate implementation by Commission and Member States
However, MEPs criticise the fact that "of 21 Commission actions scheduled for completion in 2007 only three had been fully carried out by 1 September 2007." Member States, MEPs point out, have also failed "to prioritise full and prompt transposition of and compliance with energy efficiency legislation."
Parliament wants to "set minimum energy performance requirements for all transport modes"; to ensure that the proportion of structural and cohesion funding spent on improving energy efficiency of existing homes be raised from 3% to a minimum of 5%; and to include binding requirements regarding energy efficiency for all new buildings requiring heating and/or cooling.

Improving police cooperation among EU countries in crisis situations
2008-02-01 - 13:46
MEPs adopted a report giving their strong support to an Austrian initiative to improve cooperation between the special police intervention units of EU countries in crisis situations. The report gives its non-binding approval to the Council initiative and proposes few amendments to clarify concepts such as what is a "crisis situation" or how can Member States cooperate. The report was adopted with 558 votes in favour, 56 against and 10 abstentions. MEPs understand that the cooperation of such "special intervention units" should be voluntarily activated under the request of the affected Member State, "in man-made crisis situations presenting a serious direct physical threat to persons, property, infrastructure or institutions, in particular hostage taking, hijacking and similar events".
The Austrian initiative is a complement to the so-called "Prüm Decision", adopted by all Member States last summer to ensure that precise personal information --including for the first time DNA and fingerprints data -- may be exchanged swiftly and efficiently by national law enforcement officers to help combating terrorism and cross-border crime, including illegal immigration. The Prüm Decision included other forms of stepping up border police cooperation, such as "joint police operations", for which it is necessary to refer to what Member States' law permits. Police officers involved in a joint operation in another Member State's territory will carry their usual service weapons and wear their own national uniforms with a distinctive sign and an accreditation document.
In both cases (joint police operations and actions by the special intervention units), it should be the host Member State who will assume responsibility for the measures taken by the officers crossing the border, stressed the report drafted by Armando FRANÇA (PES, PT).
The European Parliament underlines that nothing in this Decision should be construed as permitting the application of these rules governing cooperation among the law enforcement agencies of the Member States to relations with the respective agencies of third countries. The purpose of this amendment is the introduction of an express material safeguard against the unauthorised expansion of these simplified rules for cooperation, to the interactions with the agencies of third countries, which might not be operating under similar standards of accountability and democratic control to those existing in the EU Member States - a situation that might result in unwarranted jeopardizing of European citizens' vital interests.

MEPs adopt simplified regime for the control of visas in Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus
2008-02-01 - 13:46
The European parliament gave the go-ahead for an extension of simplified controls of visas at the external frontiers of Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus. This system will enable these Member States to recognise unilaterally certain documents issued by Schengen zone countries for third country nationals making visits of less than five days. As the Council of Ministers agreed last week on the amendments brought by the two reports, the path is now clear for an agreement in first reading.
MEPs adopted a legislative report from Michael Cashman (PES, UK) (558 votes in favour to 22 against and 19 abstentions) on a simplified regime for the control of persons at EU's external borders. The new system will enable Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus to recognise unilaterally visas or residence permits issued by any Schengen Member State for individuals making visits of less than five days.
Up till now, Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus were required to issue specific national visas for entry or transit through their territory to third country nationals holding a valid visa or residence permit issued by any country of the Schengen area.
The new rules will be temporary and only affect Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus until they join the Schengen area.
MEPs adopted a second co-decision report, by Panayiotis Demetriou (EPP-ED, CY), by 571 votes in favour to 24 against and 26 abstentions. It will enable Member States belonging to Schengen to recognise unilaterally certain residence documents issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein, also for transit purposes.

Attract researchers and stop the brain drain, say MEPs
2008-02-01 - 13:46
The EU has to re-attract competent researchers and prevent a further outflow from the EU, says the European Parliament in its own-initiative report on the European Research Area adopted with 602 votes in favour, 18 against and 6 abstentions. MEPs call on Member States to abolish any barriers that hinder researchers from entering the EU. They also propose a "research voucher" and postdoctoral fellowships which build on the Erasmus programme to increase researchers' mobility within the EU. The EU is far behind its objective to increase its average funding of research and development to 3% of the GDP by 2010, says the own-initiative report by Umberto GUIDONI (EUL/NGL, IT).
Research and Development Figures
The House regrets that figures for expenditure on research and development show that the EU average is only 1.84% of GDP against 2.68% in the USA and 3.18 % in Japan; and that expenditure varies from 0.39% in Romania and 0.4% in Cyprus to 3.86% in Sweden. The report underlines the importance of increasing the average spending as well as raising expenditure in some Member States and highlights the importance of better focussing the diverse research and development efforts throughout the Union, especially in order to facilitate the transition towards the digital economy. The committee says that this is fundamental for the creation of appropriate conditions for the achievement of the knowledge-based economy called for in the Lisbon Strategy.
Easier access to the EU for researchers
The European Parliament stresses that a further outflow of competent European researchers must be prevented. MEPs in the committee urge Member States to abolish any barriers that hinder access to the EU for researchers such as insufficient recognition or portability of acquired social entitlements, tax disadvantages, and difficulties in relocating families.
MEPs also consider it important to align the EU's scientific co-operation policies with EU foreign policy and development aid programmes. MEPs call on the Commission to initiate actions to increase the participation of scientists from developing countries in international collaborative science and R&D projects and to promote access to existing intellectual property globally. The committee supports the Commission's proposal to create a "blue card system" which would be of "great value for human resources in science and technology".
"Research voucher" and "Erasmus programme" for postdoctoral studies shall promote researchers' mobility
MEPs propose a "research voucher" which hosting institutions and universities issue to researchers from other Member States thus providing additional financial resources to the actual research that attracts foreign researchers. This system would be an incentive for Member States and research institutions to compete for the most talented scientists, say MEPs.
As another means of supporting researchers' mobility the Commission and the Member States should consider launching European postdoctoral fellowships and training schemes which build on the successful Erasmus programme.
Fair sharing of knowledge
The House supports the Commission's approach of "open innovation" for sharing knowledge between public and private sectors. However, MEPs call for "a balanced and fair system" between open access to scientific results and use of such results by the private sector. They stress that the industry should officially recognise the rule of "a fair and equitable financial reward" for the use of public knowledge.
The Internet opens up "opportunities for experimentation with new models" (such as Open Access), says the report. Yet, MEPs stress that authors' freedom of choice and intellectual property rights need to be respected and quality peer review must be ensured. Through pilot projects impact and viability of alternative models such as Open Access should be evaluated.
Finally, MEPs consider it "vital" to establish a Community Patent and a "high-quality, cost-effective, innovation-friendly judicial system for European patents". Text adopted by the EP on European Research Area : new perspectives

Positive and negative incentives for the industry to eliminate discards
2008-02-01 - 13:46
Parliament adopted a report (616 votes in favour to 22 against, with amendments) reacting to the Commission communication "A policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards in European fisheries". According to MEPs, the most sensible way to proceed is by choosing a number of pilot fisheries, based upon the quantity of discards produced or on the conservation status of the species involved. Two possible candidates would be the various beam trawl fisheries and those fisheries that catch and discard cod.
Scottish government position
The report welcomes the recent introduction by the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Scottish fishing industry, of a voluntary system of real time area closures whereby fishing grounds will be closed for a three-week period in the event of skippers identifying a high abundance of undersized cod. The committee believes that schemes such as this, the first of its kind in Europe, have the potential to contribute to the reduction of discards whilst working with the full co-operation of the fishing industry.
Beginning on 1 September 2007, the Scottish industry, in cooperation with the Scottish Executive, initiated a voluntary system of real-time closures. If on-board observers detect catches of small cod (specifically, 60 cod per hour of fishing) then further samples are taken and, if confirmed, a closed area of 15 miles square is created for a period of 21 days. Vessels from other Member States are encouraged to follow the scheme.
By-catches and discards are a serious ecological and economic problem. On the one hand they are responsible for the imbalance seen in some ecosystems, and on the other hand they have been identified as the main cause of the depletion of stocks, some of them with a high commercial value, such as cod. Discards have been estimated to be between 7 million and 27 million tonnes per year worldwide, equivalent to one quarter of all fish and other species caught.
In a report drawn up by Carl SCHLYTER (Greens/EFA, SE), the European Parliament welcomes the Commission's new attempt to stimulate discussion about this serious subject "with a view to finally shifting the emphasis of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) so that the practice of discarding is ultimately eliminated".
According to MEPs, one effective action to reduce unwanted by-catches and discards is a reduction in overall fishing effort, "since depleted stocks consist mainly of under-sized fish", accompanied by an improvement in selective measures. They recognize that "reduced fishing pressure would provide significant benefits for the industry by allowing depleted stocks to recover and become more productive as well as saving time and effort in sorting the catch".
Incentives for the industry to improve its fishing practices
The EP encourages the Commission, the Member States and other stakeholders to consider the "use of incentives for the industry to improve its fishing practices", mentioning various possibilities for such incentives, including:
allowing more days at sea or increasing the allowable fishing time, for vessels using more selective gear;
providing preferential access for vessels using selective gear to areas that are closed to those vessels not using selective gear;
allowing vessels with more selective gear to fish during times when others are not allowed.
"The industry would respond more favourably and with greater effect to a combination of positive and negative incentives, which should be given an opportunity to produce results", MEPs say, adding that "a discard ban should be implemented after other types of negative incentives have been tried, including timed series of increases in mesh sizes, closed areas and others".
If discard bans are adopted for specific fisheries, then "in order to avoid perverse incentives such as creating a market for small fish or fish caught without quotas, such fish should not be marketed directly under any circumstances". The House considers that "the vessels may be compensated for the costs incurred in bringing to shore what they would have discarded". MEPs say that, for example, "the fish involved could be used for fishmeal and fishoil production with any such company utilising this facility contributing to a regionally organised compensation fund".
Pilot projects
According to the EP, the most sensible way to proceed is by choosing a number of pilot fisheries, based upon the quantity of discards produced or on the conservation status of the species involved. The pilot projects should be selected in several zones to represent the geographical variety of Community fisheries. Each pilot project must also involve a sufficient number of vessels to cover the diversity of the fishery as well as to ensure good information exchange with others in the fishery.
MEPs suggest that two possible candidate fisheries would be the various beam trawl fisheries as well as those fisheries that catch and discard cod. While these pilot projects are proceeding, other fisheries should be evaluated for their discard rate.

Statistics on aquaculture production to be improved in the EU
2008-02-01 - 13:46
In a world in which fish stocks are declining and world demand for fish and seafood is constantly rising, aquaculture is becoming increasingly important. MEPs adopted a co-decision report by 599 votes in favour to 9 against and 17 abstentions drawn up by Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR) on a proposal aiming to replace the current Community legislation on the submission by Member States of statistics on aquaculture production, which has been in force for more than ten years. While Mr Morillon, rapporteur, supports the Commission’s proposal, he, however, suggested some amendments to improve the clarity and coherence of the text, tto ake account of the problems faced by some Member States and make provision for information and regular updates for the European Parliament and the Council concerning the application of the legislation.
Mr Morillon considers that the changes introduced should enable the submission of annual data on the volume of aquaculture production to be improved, and that they will improve the accessibility of the requisite information.
According to the European Parliament, in order to ensure a smooth transition, this regulation should allow for a transitional period of up to three years to be granted to Member States where its application to their national statistical systems would require major adaptations and would be likely to cause significant practical problems.
MEPs also add that within three years of this regulation coming into force, and every three years thereafter, the Commission shall submit an "evaluation report" to the EP and to the Council on the statistics compiled and, in particular, on their relevance and quality. This report should undertake a "cost-effectiveness analysis of the system introduced to collect and draw up the statistics" and indicate best practices to lessen the workload for Member States and enhance the usefulness and quality of the data.
Context
The Community legislation on statistics on aquaculture has been in force for more than ten years. It provides for Member States to submit annual data on the volume of aquaculture production to the Commission. Since Regulation (EC) 788/96 was approved, there has been a considerable increase in aquaculture.
"The current situation in the sector plays an important socio-economic role in several European regions by enabling the development of a processing industry with a promising future", says the rapporteur. "The need for a broader range of data has, therefore, become an urgent one, if there is to be rational development and management within the Common Fisheries Policy".
The need for wide-scale collection of statistical data on aquaculture stems from the importance of having an accurate and comprehensive overview of aquaculture businesses, their cultivation techniques and the different production environments, adds Philippe MORILLON.
The aquaculture sector in numbers
The EU’s aquaculture sector totals 1.3 million tons of fisheries products per year, representing some 3 billion euros. This corresponds to around one third of the total value of production in the EU’s fisheries sector and roughly one fifth of its volume. In some Member States the value of farmed products is higher than that of products landed. In others, aquaculture represents a significant proportion of total production. In Greece, for example, 100 000 of every 200 000 tons of fish are produced by aquaculture.
As well as encompassing important sources of products for European consumers, the aquaculture sector is also a substantial source of employment in regions dependent on fishing. European aquaculture provides more than 80 000 full and part-time jobs, which is the equivalent of 57 000 full-time jobs. Statistics on aquaculture
