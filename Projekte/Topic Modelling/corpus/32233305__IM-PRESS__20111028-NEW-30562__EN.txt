Parliament keeps up the pressure on economic governance
2011-11-10 - 14:07
MEPs are likely to put pressure on Messrs Van Rompuy and Barroso to take a tougher line on accountability and transparency, and develop a policy approach that is not essentially based on the decisions of just a couple of Member States. The Commission is due to present further legislative proposals on economic governance at the end of November.

Cutting down sovereign debt speculation and certain short selling practices
2011-11-10 - 14:07
Profiteering from a country's fiscal troubles will be made much harder by legislation on short selling and credit default swaps (CDS), to be voted on Tuesday. This legislation, a response to the financial crisis, was heavily influenced by Parliament, in particular to ban buying CDS where the buyer does not already own the country's underlying bonds. The legislation will tighten rules on short selling and CDS trading, two practices accused of fuelling market volatility. CDS trades have been widely blamed for potentially aggravating Greece's troubles.
The overarching aim of all the new requirements is to impose more transparency, so as to enable regulators and supervisors to do their crisis prevention work better.
The watchdog European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), was also considerably strengthened by Parliament. It will now be at the heart of all monitoring activities and in a number of instances will be called upon to give its verdict on the interpretation of the rules. Finally, ESMA will see its emergency powers increased to allow swifter action to be taken.

Making it easier for doctors to work abroad in the EU
2011-11-10 - 14:07
To make it easier for doctors, engineers, dentists and other professionals to work in abroad within the EU, host Member States need to recognise their qualifications faster, but without compromising the reliability or safety of their work for citizens, says a resolution to be voted on Tuesday. The current system for recognising professional qualifications earned in another EU Member State is overly cumbersome and time-consuming, say Internal Market Committee MEPs.
Simplifying the system will not only help the more than 50% of young Europeans whom a recent survey found want to work abroad, but is also vital to spur economic growth, add flexibility to the labour market and respond to labour shortages in parts of the EU.
To simplify procedures, the resolution, by UK MEP Emma McClarkin (ECR), proposes introducing a voluntary professional card, to be linked to the existing Internal Market Information System (IMI), which connects public authorities across the EU.
To protect citizens' safety, a mechanism should be created within the IMI to alert all Member States when action is taken against a professional in any one country. Member States should also be allowed to test the language skills of healthcare professionals, says the text.
The resolution sets out Parliament's inputs to a legislative proposal, to be tabled by the Commission in December, to revise the 2005 Professional Qualifications Directive.
Improving mobility for professionals is one of the 12 priorities of the Single Market Act, the Commission's action plan to improve the functioning of the single market.

Call to act to halt bee deaths
2011-11-10 - 14:07
The EU should step up investment in research on new medicines to prevent bee deaths and coordinate its efforts to protect what is fast becoming an endangered species, says a resolution to be voted on Tuesday. EU countries should pool their research, prevention research and control efforts, and share their findings among laboratories, beekeepers, farmers and the industry so as to avoid overlaps and boost effectiveness, says the draft.
EU-level research funding should also be stepped up, as should support for diagnostic laboratories and field tests at national level, it says.
For example, new medicines are needed to beat the Varroa mite, which is currently almost untreatable.
Rules on authorising and making available veterinary products for honeybees should be made more flexible and pharmaceutical companies should be given incentives to develop new ones, but excessive use of antibiotics should be avoided, due to their impact on bee product quality and growing antibiotic resistance, say MEPs.
The European Commission should also monitor animal health developments in third countries, apply the strictest animal health requirements and put in place a system for monitoring imported products, so as to avoid introducing exotic bee diseases, they add.
An estimated 84% of plant species and 76% of food production in Europe depend on pollination by bees.

European heritage label from 2013
2011-11-10 - 14:07
Symbolic sites for Europe's history or integration will be eligible for a voluntary European heritage label from 2013 under plans to be voted by Parliament on Wednesday. The label would be granted, for example, to monuments, natural or industrial sites, or places of remembrance. Participation in the scheme will be voluntary, under an informal agreement already reached by an EP delegation and the Council.
The plans give special attention to "transnational" sites, given their special symbolism for Europe's history. Member States may also apply for a "thematic" label for several national sites linked by a common theme.
Every two years, Member States will be able to propose up to two candidate sites, from which the jury of 13 independent experts will chose a maximum of one per country.
Managing, protecting and promoting the sites will remain the responsibility of Member States. The European Commission will handle communication and awareness-raising work.

EP set to tighten up EU railway market rules
2011-11-10 - 14:07
Parliament votes Wednesday on plans to tighten up EU railway market rules in order to establish a truly open and competitive single European railway area, offering more and better rail services for freight customers and passengers. Every Member State should establish an independent regulator to prevent discrimination and market distortions, says the Transport Committee resolution, by Debora Serracchiani (S&D, IT).
The rapporteur also advocates tightening up the provisions of the proposed recast of rail directives 91/440/EEC, 95/18/EC and 2001/14/EC, so as to ensure greater financial transparency and clearly separate the accounts of rail transport firms from those of rail network managers.
MEPs oppose an obligation for railway companies to always provide a "minimum service" initially suggested by the Commission.
Ms Serracchiani (S&D, IT) and Transport Committee chair Brian Simpson (S&D, UK) will hold a press conference after the vote.

Online gambling: MEPs to call for EU-wide coordination to fight the black market and protect children
2011-11-10 - 14:07
EU Member States should be free to make their own rules on online gambling, but should also co-ordinate them, so as to combat illegal cross-border gambling, protect children, and prevent vulnerable adults from getting addicted, says a resolution to be voted on Tuesday. About 10% of all gaming in Europe, with a market volume in excess of €10 billion, is done on the internet, via mobile phones or interactive TV platforms.
This non-legislative resolution, drafted by Internal Market Committee MEP Jürgen Creutzmann (ALDE, DE) sets out Parliament's initial position on a Commission Green Paper of March 2011.

Court of Auditors' annual report on EU spending in 2010
2011-11-10 - 14:07
MEPs will debate the European Court of Auditors' annual report for 2010 on Tuesday afternoon, with its President Vítor Manuel Da Silva Caldeira and Audit Commissioner Algirdas Šemeta. Mr Da Silva Caldeira presented the report to the Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee on Thursday 10 November, starting the 2010 discharge procedure.
The European Parliament is the EU discharge authority, which means that it needs to approve the way EU funds have been spent, mostly in the Member States.
Following the audit and finalisation of the annual accounts, Parliament decides - acting on a recommendation from the Council - whether to grant discharge to the Commission and other EU bodies for the way they have managed their budgets during the preceding financial year. The rapporteur for the 2010 discharge procedure is Christofer Fjellner (EPP, SE).

MEPs set to vote €40 million for integrated maritime policy
2011-11-10 - 14:07
MEPs vote Thursday on whether to invest €40 million in integrated maritime policy pilot schemes for 2011-2013. These schemes are part of an integrated maritime policy action plan agreed by the EU in 2007 to preserve its marine resources. Thanks to the perseverance of MEPs and rapporteur Georgios Koumoutsakos (EPP, EL), a first-reading agreement with the Council is within reach.
The EU's integrated maritime policy encompasses transport, tourism and fisheries, environment protection and biodiversity.
MEPs want to protect its funding by including it in the EU's 2014-2020 "financial perspectives" (multi-annual financial framework).

Roma discrimination
2011-11-10 - 14:07
Discrimination and violations of the human rights of Roma people will be debated on Wednesday afternoon. MEPs will ask what the Commission and Council are doing to tackle this problem and ensure Roma citizens' freedom of movement and residence throughout Europe. Earlier this year, EU guidelines for integrating Roma people in EU Member States set targets for Roma inclusion in education, employment, health and housing. By the end of 2011, Member State governments are to submit national strategies to the Commission specifying how they plan to achieve these goals.
Parliament set out its demands for these strategies in a resolution passed in March 2011.
Procedure: Oral questions to Council and Commission

MEPs to call for international action to combat illegal fishing
2011-11-10 - 14:07
MEPs will call on the EU Thursday to promote coordinated international action to combat iIlegal fishing, which threatens biodiversity worldwide, and seriously distorts markets for law-abiding EU fishermen. Proposed measures include stepping up inspections at sea, closing markets to illegal seafood and imposing sanctions on negligent states. An estimated 15% of world catches - between 11 and 26 million tonnes a year - come from illegal fishing, making sustainable management of marine resources impossible.
Procedure: Non-legislative resolution
Debate/Vote: Thursday, 17 November Draft resolution as adopted by the Fisheries Committee (11.10.2011) Profile of rapporteur Isabella LÖVIN (Greens/EFA, SE) Legislative Observatory file Commission website on illegal fishing

Helping small cinemas survive the digital switch
2011-11-10 - 14:07
Small independent cinemas which lack funds to buy modern digital equipment need EU help, says a resolution to be voted on Wednesday. The draft calls for action to help the EU film industry, throughout the production and distribution chain, to cope with the switch to digital projection. European cinema is of growing importance to the economy, as it provides more than 30,000 jobs, says the resolution, drafted by Piotr Borys (EPP, PL).
EU and national funding for European films and cinemas in the digital era should ensure the diversity of the European film industry and cinema network, as a means to promote Europe's cultural identity, and help ensure that as many citizens as possible have access to cinemas, it adds.
Procedure: Non-legislative resolution
Vote: Wednesday 16 November

Keeping the internet open and neutral
2011-11-10 - 14:07
MEPs vote Thursday on a call to ensure that the internet stays open and neutral, by ensuring that EU telecoms rules are properly enforced. They will also call on the European Commission to monitor internet traffic management practices, so as to ensure, for example, that end users do not lose their connections whenever networks are congested. It would benefit everyone if the Commission were to provide EU-wide guidelines to ensure that EU telecoms rules on net neutrality are properly applied and enforced, says the draft resolution, which was unanimously approved by the Industry, Research and Energy Committee.
MEPs also call on the Commission "to closely monitor the development of traffic management practices", e.g. to ensure that end users' connections are not disrupted by network congestion, and that "Internet Service Providers do not block, discriminate against or impair the ability of any person to use or offer any service, content or application of their choice irrespective of source or target".
Procedure: Oral question + resolution
