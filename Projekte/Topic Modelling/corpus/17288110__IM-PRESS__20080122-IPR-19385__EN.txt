The Civil Liberties Committee named Gérard Deprez (ALDE, BE) its new chairman on 22 January, by acclamation and further to the resignation of Jean-Marie Cavada (ALDE, FR), who nonetheless retains his MEP's mandate. Mr Cavada had chaired the Civil Liberties Committee since the start of 2005.
Mr Deprez's candidature was backed by a large majority in the committee, and did not need a vote. Mr Cavada said he had resigned to take part in municipal elections in France, and that this would take time. "In all fairness, I had to choose", he declared.
Looking back over his three years as chair, he paid homage to his colleagues, stressing that "in the past few years, our committee has become the most productive of this Parliament. With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, its role will grow (…) and it will need to be vigilant", he added, before handing over to his successor.
