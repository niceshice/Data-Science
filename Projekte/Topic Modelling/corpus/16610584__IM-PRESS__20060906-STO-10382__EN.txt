Parliament wants polluters to pay
MEPs voted to tax cars based on their level of pollution instead of registration. They also voted to increase spending in programs to combat violence against women and children and endorsed more money for measures against pollution and oil spills at sea. All the debates were available in 20 languages - an issue discussed in a report on multilingualism.
The car tax report drafted by Danish Liberal MEP Riis-Jørgensen includes some of the following proposals:
- phasing out car registration taxes over 5-10 years
- EU passenger cars tax based largely on CO2 production
- the inclusion of other pollutants (soot particles and nitrogen oxides)
- progressive taxation of pollutants.
Mrs Riis-Jørgensen said: “It is an important signal to the car industry. It will come up with better, less polluting cars.” He stressed this would not mean extra taxes.
"Daphne III" – fighting violence against children, young people and women
MEPs overwhelmingly voted to approve €125 million in EU support over the next six years to help organisations that tackle violence against children, young people and women in Europe. The money is vital, as according to German Socialist MEP Lissy Gröner who drafted the report, "a mere 17% or so of the projects submitted to date have received funding" under the "Daphne" programme. This initiative, launched in 1997, supports organisations to fight against violence, including: fighting domestic violence, supporting victims of trafficking, contribution to the prevention of inter-ethnic violence in schools and integration of help to neglected and abused children. Efforts to widen Daphne to include the fight against drugs were refused as it would be too wide a mandate.
Pollution at Sea: European Maritime Agency gets more funding.
MEPs welcomed extra funding of €154 million for the European Maritime Safety Agency to help prevent pollution from shipping through patrol vessels and satellite equipment. The agency was founded after the "Erika" and "Prestige" oil tanker disasters .
Multilingualism - interpretation costs
Parliament adopted report by Finnish Conservative Alexander Stubb about spending on interpretation and ways to improve working methods in multilingual EU institutions.
The report highlights areas in which savings could be made while underlining that multilingualism and the ability to understand other speakers in the European Parliament is crucial for European democracy. While the total cost of translation and interpretation in all EU bodies represents just 1% of the EU budget, the report says efforts should be made to cut costs by increasing awareness of interpretation costs, reducing stand-by time for interpreters and optimally managing needs and resources. and taking a pragmatic approach.
Today in the Plenary :
MEPs debate the EU's future role in Kosovo, a stabilisation agreement with Albania and, this afternoon, the situation in the Middle-East.
