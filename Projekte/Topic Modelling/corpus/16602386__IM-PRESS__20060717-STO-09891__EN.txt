EU-Africa - on the road to better cooperation?
Thousands of migrants risk their lives every year to enter the European Union - and many do not reach their destination alive. They all come in the hope of a better life in Europe. How best to tackle the issues raised by immigration is a key concern for the European Parliament and the EU. It was also the focus of a recent Euro-African ministerial conference on migration and development in the Moroccan capital Rabat.
The acute situation of a mass influx of migrants trying to reach the European Union has made urgent action a priority. Therefore France, Spain and Morocco jointly initiated the Rabat-conference on 10-11 July, an event which brought together 57 countries from both shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
"For the first time countries of emigration, countries of transit and countries of destination came together to discuss the problem and examine possible measures in common", said French MEP Jean-Marie Cavada (Liberal ALDE Group), who participated in the conference.
Economic inequality driving illegal immigration
Mr Cavada chairs the Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee where migration and asylum is one of the most pressing issues. He added that for the first time since the 1999 EU summit in Tampere, Finland, "the Union is admitting that the problems linked to immigration derive largely from inappropriate upstream policies of economic development in countries of migration. But just as we must fight illegal immigration, it is still essential to lend legal migrants the necessary integration support they need".
The conference approved a 62-point Action Plan introducing "a close partnership" between Europe and Africa which was endorsed by the European Commissioner for Justice Franco Frattini. The plan stresses the need for further action to promote development in African countries, including the use of new funds to help legal immigrants in Europe who want to invest in projects based on their countries of origin. The fight against criminal organisations involved in human trafficking was another issue discussed at Rabat.
For the Rabat process to be a success, however, it will be essential to ensure that words become action. Mr Cavada added that "the European Parliament expects the Rabat process to set up a close monitoring committee" to follow up implementation of the proposals.
MEPs see situation in detention centres
Members of the Civil Liberties Committee recently visited centres where migrants are being held in the Canary Islands (Spanish). (Read a report of their visit by clicking on the link below). This follows inspections of similar centres in Lampedusa (Italy), Ceuta and Melilla (autonomous Spanish cities in Africa), Paris and Malta.
After these visits Spanish Socialist MEP Manuel Medina Ortega insisted that the problem of illegal immigration affects the EU as a whole, as the majority of immigrants finish by staying in the EU territory, and therefore "this cannot be left in the hands of national governments."
