Tuesday night saw former winners of the human rights prize discuss its impact Celebrating 20 years of the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, 16 previous laureates gathered in Strasbourg to share their views on global human rights, and the importance of the Sakharov Prize.
Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering is keen to implement the formation of a "Sakharov network" allowing laureates to link to one another's activities and to show solidarity.
Bringing about real change
Watched by Andrei Sakharov's widow, Ms Elena Bonner, the laureates voiced their views on the prize and changes it can bring in the field of human rights.
Ms Leyla Zana , a Kurdish politician from North Kurdistan received the prize in 1995, standing as the first Kurdish member of the Turkish Parliament. Today there are 22 Kurdish MPs: "I think that this prize has definitely encouraged a lot of people especially among the Kurdish people," she said.
Ms Taslima Nasreen is a Bengali feminist writer, exiled from India and Bangladesh, said "I have no home, I am homeless everywhere." However, "The Sakharov Prize gives me the encouragement to go on fighting in this difficult situation."
The Sakharov prize money is often used by laureates to bring about change. Ms Hauwa Ibrahim, a Nigerian human rights lawyer, used the €50,000 prize money to send over 100 children back to school.
The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo (Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo), Argentinean human rights activists, used the money to open a bookshop, political cafe and university, which now accommodates over 2400 students.
The future of the prize
Mr Olivier Basille, from Reporters without Borders said that the profile of the award must be raised. "He said the European Parliament should create a network of winners, improve the work with the media, make blogs and send laureates to countries not linked to the origin of the winner to speak there.
Kosovar Albanian writer and politician Mr Adem Demaçi suggested that the EP could be "more generous with the money because the sum awarded is lower than for other prizes in the same area."
