Who will win the LUX Prize?
Eighty years ago to the day, the first full-length movie with synchronized sound was released. Today, the "seventh art" is arguably the first, with film central to cultural identity and experience across the planet. In recognition of this, the European Parliament has created the LUX Prize. From 800 European films released between 1 May 2006 and 1 June 2007, three have been short-listed for the Prize, to be awarded on 24 October. MEPs will choose the winner.
This is the first year the prize will be awarded. The winner will get a trophy and financial aid to subtitle the film into all 23 EU official languages. The original version of the winning film will be adapted to people with special needs and if the film is already being screened across Europe, money will be made available to put the film on DVD.
The short-listed films are:
German-Turkish Auf der anderen Seite (the Edge of heaven) by Fatih Akin
Romanian "4 luni, 3 septamini si 2 zile" (4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days) by Cristian Mungiu
Franco-Portuguese film honouring Bunuel "Belle toujours" by Manoel de Oliveira
The EU as a cultural project
EP Vice-President GÃ©rard Onesta is the driving force behind the prize. He sees Europe as a cultural project, with the European Parliament playing an essential part. "Fifty years ago Monnet is often quoted as saying: ' If we had to do everything again, we would have to start with culture.'"
"The EU is mostly associated with technocracy. We want an intimate Europe, one close to the citizen," said Mr Onesta. The US understood this a century ago with Hollywood, but it is more difficult in Europe because of linguistic barriers and national markets.
The prize aims to bring Europe closer to the citizens via cinema and to make high quality non-elitist films for the public. To be eligible for the prize a film must represent at least one of the following criteria:
universality of Europe's values
Europe 's cultural diversity
the debate on the integration of Europe
Why Prix Lux?
Lux means light in Latin. The trophy represents a positive version of the tower of Babel, like the European Parliament, a symbol of linguistic and cultural diversity, said Mr Onesta.
