Member States struggling to reap full benefit of CAP, say MEPs

The European Parliament adopted a report calling on the European Commission to take more account of the needs of the new Member States in its decisions on the Common Agriculture Policy. The low level of direct aid received by these countries is creating unequal conditions of competition, according to MEPs.
In an own-initiative report by Csaba SÃ¡ndor TABAJDI (PES, HU), the House describes the challenges faced by the new Member States in living with the CAP. These include major efforts to comply with Community health and hygiene rules, higher production costs and difficulties in implementing rural development programmes.
Parliament also argues that the long phasing-in period (9 years), with a low starting level (25 %) for the direct payments in the new Member States, means that farmers in these states are not competing on a level playing field with other European farmers on the European internal market and even their domestic markets.
These countries have also been obliged to top up EU farm support from their national budgets. This virtually amounts to "renationalisation" of a Community policy and, by imposing a burden on national finances, has caused political and economic difficulties in some new Member States.
The countries which joined the EU in 2004 have thus benefited from enlargement "only partly" in the areas of farming and food production. The House, therefore, calls on the Commission to take account of their situation in its application of the CAP, for example, by extending certain derogations regarding EU environmental standards which were laid down in the accession treaties.
