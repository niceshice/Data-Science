Piracy off Somalia: tackle root causes, say MEPs

EU anti-piracy escorts off Somalia are working, but piracy cannot be eliminated unless its root causes on land - including poverty and Somalia's failed state - are tackled too, said Parliament on Thursday, adding that all vessels should register for protection.
Operation NAVFOR Atalanta is contributing successfully to maritime security off the coast of Somalia, inter alia by protecting 50 World Food Programme ships delivering food aid to Somalia, says a resolution adopted by Parliament on Thursday by 479 votes to 96, with 54 abstentions.
Root causes
Piracy can only be eliminated by addressing its root causes, such as poverty and state failure, on land, says the resolution, which also calls for an independent investigation into war crimes and human rights violations in Somalia.
No place for weakness
Taking a "weak attitude" towards pirates' demands, without "the necessary coercive measures", could be counter-productive, say MEPs, who suggest setting up a small-scale European Security and Defence Policy operation, in parallel to Operation NAVFOR, to train Somali security forces.
Ships should register for safety
To reduce the risks of attack or capture, all vessels should register with maritime security operations, as recommended by EU NAVFOR, say MEPs, noting that about 40% of vessels sailing in the area are not registered with these organisations.
Toxic waste and illegal fishing
Finally, MEPs urge the United Nations and the European Commission to investigate toxic waste dumping and illegal fishing along the Somali coast.
