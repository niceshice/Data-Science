EP: Fair chances for both men and women
Women's rights/Equal opportunities
2009-05-14 - 12:50
female and male head, next to each other Despite vigorous efforts, men and women do not always get the same start or benefit from the same opportunities. This applies to work, salary, access to politics and family-career balance. The European parliament has been active in promoting rules that bring fair chances to both sexes.
Women account for more than half of the EU population - and therefore more than half of the potential voters. Ahead of the European elections in June, parliament has focused on several areas supporting gender equality.
The lot of women has improved considerably over the past 30 years, in part thanks to EU action. A lot has been done at the EU level including the promotion of equality at work, the fight against violence and campaigns against forced prostitution. However, more changes are needed. Women still earn less than men, there are fewer women in politics than men and they often face difficulties in balancing family and career.

How has the EU improved gender equality in the past 30 years?
Illustration picture of a working man and woman side by side ©BELGA_SCIENCE_AW2 In the last 30 years the European Union has striven to seek gender equality in all aspects of its work. As a result many tangible changes over equal working conditions, discrimination and violence. To date campaigns have been varied and included the help of NGOs and charities.
EP legislation: Equality at work
Since the 1970s the EU has used legislative powers to push for equal pay. MEPs amended equal pay legislation in 1999 and have reviewed it every 2 years from 2002.
In 2006 the number of female managers in the European Union was 32.6%. There was also a rise in the number of women MEPs from 16.3% in 1979 to 31% in 2009. However, there is still a pay gap. Women in Europe earn on average 17% less than their male counterparts.
Condemning violence against women
It is estimated that around a quarter of all women in Europe have experienced physical acts of violence at least once in their adult lives. The "Daphne Programme", launched in 1997, aims to fund and support projects charged with eradicating violence against women. The programme also supports schemes aimed at safeguarding young people.
The Parliament unites against forced prostitution
In 2006 before the football World Cup, the committee on gender rights and female equality (FEMM) launched the campaign, "Red Card to Forced Prostitution". The scheme has been reused at other sporting events such as the Euro 2008 football championship.
The Chair of Parliament's Women's Rights Committee Anna Záborská (EPP-ED) said, "this so-called 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution' campaign was a great success because it contributed positively towards reducing trafficking and forced prostitution during the championship games."
Creating greater visibility of equality issues
In 2006 the European Institute for Gender Equality was created in Vilnius to promote gender equality, fight against discrimination and analyse and disseminate data on gender equality.
As well as the measures mentioned above, the Parliament also draws attention to specific issues with its own initiative reports from Members which can become valuable tools for raising awareness.

Poll backs more women in politics but not quotas
3 women with arms upraised silhouetted against a lilac background People want to see more women in politics, according to a Europe-wide poll that shows over two thirds of those asked believe politics is male dominated. However, only one in ten thought quotas a good idea. The results of the latest Eurobarometer poll were presented at a seminar in the European Parliament in March.
We asked what you thought and you can click below to read the comments we received.
More day care, less violence
Other issues in focus were calls for more day care facilities and a reduction in violence towards and trafficking of women.
The poll found that women are more concerned than men about the economic situation, risks of globalisation and its likely impact of the euro. Women also want the EP to push for time spent looking after children at home to be counted towards pension entitlements.
During the seminar, Parliament's Vice-President Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou said the results offer "important elements about the female voters such as their expectations, their image of the EU, their priority policies to be defended or discussed during the campaign, their participation to politics in European level."
The European Commission's most senior women, Vice-President Margot Wallström said, "a democracy which does not make enough room for 52% of the population at the decision-making table is no real democracy at all."
Politics - a man's world?
The poll found that women are less interested in European issues, although the probability of voting in June elections was broadly similar for both genders (28% of women compared to 31 % of men).
It found that a clear majority of men (77 %) agree that men dominate the political scene and that more women in politics could lead to a different style. In terms of how they decide to vote, two thirds of women gave importance to candidates´ experience on European issues rather than political orientation.
The poll of 35,000 women and 5,500 men across the EU's 27 countries was conducted ahead of the June European elections and to mark International Women's Day on 8 March.

Past and future of Women's Rights Committee - Interview with Anna Záborská
Slovak MEP and Chair of the Women's Rights Committee Anna Záborská The impact of poverty on women and the work-life balance are just two issues the Women's Rights Committee had tackled over the last Parliamentary term. As we head towards the end of this legislature we talked to the Chair of the Committee, Slovak EPP-ED Anna Záborská, about the Committee's record and what key issues lie ahead.
Which issues discussed by the Women's Rights Committee over the last term have been the most important?
Personally, I find them all important and we have adopted more than 40 reports. But those that I would like to highlight are those on the Lisbon strategy, demographics in Europe, family-work balance, women and poverty, migrant women, women in jail and the influence of this situation on family life. There were also reports on women in conflicts areas and of course we dealt with the issue of women in important posts and women in science.
A lot of reports concerning gender equality are non-legislative. Do they have any impact on people's lives?
I think that reports of the Women's Rights Committee are very important as they provide a kind of background research of the issue in EU. They propose some solutions and these reports can be used in the work of other committees. So they do not enter directly into EU legislation, but they serve as a source of information.
Only 3 out of 40 members of Committee are men. Why is that so and what would you do to change it?
The reason why women have not yet achieved equality, despite the fact that they have been trying for decades, is the idea that they can do it by themselves, that they do not need men. Since the beginning of this Parliamentary term we started talking more and more that it is essential to include men on the issue. The equality of women must also be in the interests of men. For example take work-family balance: if we do not include men, women will never achieve their goal. When men realize that women expect and assume that men would participate, men will also be more interested to become the members of Women's Rights Committee.
What are the topics you and your fellow MEPs on the Committee will be working on in the future?
The above mentioned topics are long-term issues. But when I see the current economic and financial crisis, which is very likely to turn into social crisis, the topics that will be discussed in future are women and poverty, work-family balance and intergeneration solidarity. We have also to bear in mind that at the current demographic situation, one of the solutions, which I do not consider as being paramount, is immigration. So the topic which will be discussed a lot in next parliamentary term will be also female immigrants and family reunification.
The equality of women must also be in the interests of men

How should we help balance family and career?
A laptop computer and a bottle of milk Equal opportunities for men and women, equal pay for equal work, freedom from unfair discrimination: these are fundamental European values. But how far should we go to achieve them? How far should we go to ensure that people don't have to choose between career and family? How much do we invest in making these things happen? There are practical choices to be made, laws to be enacted and action to be taken. The choices are yours, when you cast your vote in the June 2009 elections.
Times have changed. Many may recall times when women were expected to bring men their...slippers and a woman's role in life was to have and raise children and obey their husbands. Maybe times haven't changed as much as we think.
More women than ever are managers or involved in politics. In 2006, the number of female managers in the EU was 32.6% and the number of women MEPs rose from 16.3% in 1979 to 31% in 2009. But women in Europe still earn on average 17% less than their male counterparts and one person in 10 has suffered at one point in his/her life from some form of bullying, harassment or violence at work.
Community programmes like the "Daphne Programme" help to eradicate violence against women, steps like the creation of a European Institute for Gender Equality in Vilnius and campaigns such as the "Red Card to Forced Prostitution" that MEPs launched in 2006, are all examples of measures promoting gender equality and are definitely positive. But are they enough? Should more be done? Your vote in the 4-7 June European election will be your answer to these questions.
Work-life balance: luxury or a "must"?
According to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, a woman working full-time works 40 hours a week, while men work on average 43 hours. But can we say that men work more than women, given the unpaid hours that many women put in caring for children, sick or elderly relatives and doing household chores? And in a world where people live longer and have fewer children, is work-life balance really an option or more like an obligation for the legislator? And are men being given the choices they deserve?
In any case, the MEPs you choose will be the ones to decide on what more (if anything) needs to done in Europe on many issues that could affect your work-life balance, such as job sharing, teleworking, flexitime and compressed working (where full-time is compressed into fewer days), maternity leave as well as part-time and temporary work. What else would you like them to do? Make your choice clear with your vote on 4-7 June!

Mums and dads at home with newborns: how long should they have off?
Pregnant woman at work holding belly with coworker in background Across Europe the amount of time new mums can have off after the birth of their child varies from 14 to 52 weeks . MEPs on the Women's Rights Committee backed EU-wide plans to have 14 to 20 weeks of leave after birth and extend the amount of time mums can claim full pay from 2 to 6 weeks. Proposed new rules would also give dads more time off. Two MEPs with opposing views debated the pros and cons and you told us what you think.
The women who drafted Parliament's report is Portuguese Socialist Edite Estrela . Maternity leave of at least 20 weeks "is the appropriate period of time to help workers to recover from childbirth, foster mother-child bonds and encourage breastfeeding in the first months of life," she said.
In addition, longer maternity leave would act as a spur to childbearing in Europe, which has a falling birth rate and ageing population, she said.
Longer maternity leave could discourage employers
However, Slovak Christian Democrat Edit Bauer said the new rules would discourage companies from employing women: "There are countries, such as Germany, where the maternity leave is paid by the employer. These countries are in regards of current economic problems resolutely against the prolongation of maternity leave."
The report also calls on member states to provide for a minimum of two weeks paternity leave.
For Ms Estrela "the right to paternity leave is crucial to promote a balanced participation of men and women at work and the sharing of family responsibilities." Paternity should also provide "further support to women while recovering from childbirth and encourage the involvement of the father in the life of the child."
Ms Bauer said that parental leave should be dealt with separately. "The directive is particularly on protecting the health and security of pregnant and breastfeeding women. I think that parental leave does not belong to this directive. Of course we have to find a way to better balance work and family life as well as to find more just division of labour and responsibility in family - but not in this directive."

Plenary: Better protection for assisting spouses, "maternity leave" back to committee
The European Parliament wants to make it compulsory for assisting spouses to have social security cover. MEPs are also keen to strengthen the maternity leave rights of self-employed women and assisting spouses. The directive on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding has been referred back to the Women's Rights Committee.
The draft directive defines "assisting spouses" as the spouses or life partners of self-employed workers, when recognised by national law, not being employees or business partners, where they habitually participate in the activities of the self-employed worker. They are often found in farming, commerce, SMEs and the liberal professions. The Commission is proposing that social security cover should be voluntary but the Parliament argues that membership of social insurance schemes covering sickness, invalidity and old age should be made mandatory for assisting spouses. Indeed, when assisting spouses are offered the choice of being member or not of a social insurance scheme, they often chose not to join, MEPs say. Moreover, Member States should ensure that female self-employed workers and assisting spouses are entitled to a period of maternity leave adapted to their needs, according to Parliament. The maternity leave should be of the duration of their choice provided that the total length does not exceed that specified in Directive 92/85/EEC on pregnant workers. Parental leave legislation referred backed to the Women's Rights Committee Concerning the other draft legislation of the family package, MEPs decided to refer back to committee the report by Edite Estrela (PSE, PT) on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. The EPP-ED group argued that there would not be a compromise with the Council at first-reading and that positions within the EP are too different. Equal treatment Health and safety at work
