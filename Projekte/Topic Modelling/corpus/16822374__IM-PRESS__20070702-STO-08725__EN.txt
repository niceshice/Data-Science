Calls while abroad will now be cheaper
MEPs have urged European consumers to take advantage of cheaper calls abroad through a new "Eurotariff". Backed by the European Parliament the new regulation on mobile phone roaming charges will see outgoing calls capped at €0.49 per minute and incoming at €0.24. Effective from June 30, MEPs from all sides of the House backed the measures after repeated instances of consumers being faced with large phone bills after holidays or work trips abroad. Further cuts are due over the next two years.
Under the terms of the regulation your mobile operator has one month to offer you new prices under the Eurotariff although some have already begun advertising new rates. Consumers have two months to take up the offers although if they do not the new tariff will apply automatically at a later date.
As well as cheaper calls all users of mobile calls will now automatically receive an SMS when they go abroad informing them of the roaming charges in that area.
"Phone bills cut by some 50%"
Paul Rübig (European People's Party and European Democrats - EPP-ED) has acted as Parliament's rapporteur for the roaming issue. Speaking earlier he stressed the fact that "every European mobile user will be able to opt into a cheaper tariff by July 2007". He went on to call on European telecom operators to implement the measure speedily as "the EU has delivered within a record period of 11 months. Now I urge operators to deliver to their customers in a fair, transparent and quick manner, so that EU citizens can benefit from the regulation as soon as possible" he said.
Angelika Niebler, (EPP-ED) chair of the Parliament's Industry Committee said that the Regulation is "already has had a positive impact" as operators introduce new pricing structures. She went on to say that "customers will benefit from certain rules on transparency, for which Parliament has fought".
Arlene McCarthy of the Socialist PSE Group who Chairs Parliament's Internal Market Committee said the law "shows that Parliament acts when consumers complain about being overcharged for using their mobile phones when travelling, on holiday or on business, across Europe. Not only will consumers see their phone bills cut by some 50%, will benefit from new protection with a Eurotariff" she stressed.
What is important is that cheaper prices will be in place for a large part of the European holiday season.
