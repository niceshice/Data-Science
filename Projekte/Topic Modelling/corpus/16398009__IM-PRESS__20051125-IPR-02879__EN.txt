To mark World Aids Day, Parliament's Development Committee held a public hearing on Aids in the developing countries. Speakers included Geena GONSALVES (Action Aid), Delphine SCULLIER (Médecins sans frontières) and Marta MONTESO CULLEL (Stop Aids Alliance).
Addressing the hearing, Luisa MORGANTINI (GUE/NGL, IT), chair of the Development Committee, congratulated NGOs "on their contribution to the eradication of HIV." But she added "Despite their unceasing efforts, there are more deaths every year, children are particularly hard hit by the disease, access to drugs is non-existent in developing countries and the world's research into a vaccine is progressing slowly. For the Development Committee, Aids is a major concern, not simply a question of sharing suffering".
At the opening of yesterday's plenary sitting, Parliament's President Josep Borrell said "on behalf of the Euroepan Parliament I wish to thank all the staff and millions of volunteers who have mobilised to wipe out the scourge of Aids".
