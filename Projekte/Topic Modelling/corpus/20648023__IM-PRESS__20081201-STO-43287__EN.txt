MEPs look ahead to the European Council MEPs held a minute's silence for the victims of the terrorist attacks in India and Ignacio Uría Mendizabal, a 70-year old business man killed by ETA in Azpeita, Spain, when the Brussels plenary session opened Wednesday. Later, MEPs outlined their expectations from the next European Council and discussed the EU's strategy on Roma.
"Today in our hearts we all are Indians"
European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering condemned the attacks, expressing his sympathy to the victims' families and the solidarity of the EP with India. "Today in our hearts we all are Indians," he said. Amid the great sadness, Mr Pöttering expressed relief that all the members of a Parliament delegation in Mumbai at the time of the attacks "arrived back home safe and sound".
Mr Pöttering drew attention to World AIDS Day on 1 December. He called for better information and early treatment and underlined the importance of people having the infection not being stigmatised by society.
Next European Council
Ahead of the European Council on 11-12 December, MEPs debated the Lisbon Treaty, the EU's response to the economic and financial crisis and the fight against climate change.

Roma
Most of the MEPs disagreed with statements from the Council and Commission that progress had been made in terms of social inclusion and protection of fundamental rights of Roma. MEPs said Roma communities still suffer clear discrimination and more has to be done, particularly in the fields of education, employment and healthcare. There are 10 million of Roma currently living in the EU.
MEPs said the integration of Roma people has to be assured at European level, while the Commission and Council said EU countries have to be more active. Parliament has adopted 2 resolutions on the Roma this year.
