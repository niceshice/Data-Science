Strong EU commitment needed to get MDGs back on track

Innovative development funding mechanisms need to be backed by the EU, as the world's leading aid donor, if the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are to be met by the 2015 deadline, say MEPs in a resolution adopted on Tuesday.
With only five years to go to the 2015 deadline for achieving the MDGs, MEPs expect the June 2010 European Council "to agree on an ambitious and united EU position", ahead of the UN MDG meeting in New York on 20-22 September 2010, which must "lead to new, results-oriented, additional, transparent and measurable commitments". Ten years ago, world leaders agreed to act to eradicate world poverty by 2015, setting targets in eight priority MDG fields, such as reducing poverty and hunger by 50%, full primary education and eliminating gender disparity and health-related issues.
Keep promises made
The EU is off track even for its 2010 interim 0.56% target and there is a real risk of not meeting the MDGs on time. "What I want to see is leadership from the EU. Not the minimum set that they can agree on, but a commitment to that 0.7% of gross national income, a commitment to additional financing", said rapporteur Michael Cashman (S&D, UK), in the plenary debate on Monday 14 June.
Additional funding for development
Even without additional money to combat climate change and the effects of economic crises, innovative funding mechanisms are needed to finance MDGs. MEPS advocate:
renewed efforts to ease the debt burden of least developed countries (LDCs) with a track record of accountability, transparency and good governance,
cracking down on tax havens and tax evasion and illicit financial flows as well as systematically disclosing profits made and taxes paid by companies, and
reducing transfer costs of remittances sent by migrant workers to their home countries.
More funding for health and education
Member States and the Commission should allocate at least 20% of all development spending to basic health and education and should prioritise maternal health and combating infant mortality as progress on these MDGs is still insufficient.
"Policies on voluntary family planning, safe abortion, treatment of sexual transmitted infections and provision of reproductive health supplies made up of life-saving drugs and contraceptives, including condoms should be supported" by Member States and Commission. 13% of all maternal deaths in developing countries are due to unsafe abortions, and this figure is much higher in Africa, says the resolution.
The resolution was approved with 353 votes in favour, 206 against and 75 abstentions.
Next steps
On Thursday the European Council will set out the EU's position and political messages for the UN MDG Review High Level Plenary Meeting in New York on 20-22 September, based on the Foreign Affairs Council conclusions of Monday 14 June.
