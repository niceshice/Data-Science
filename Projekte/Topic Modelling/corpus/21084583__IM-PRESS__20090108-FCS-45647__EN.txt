Hans-Gert Pöttering prepares to enter the Chamber, Tuesday 13 Jan Last week's first Parliamentary session of the year opened with Members dealing with key international issues such as the crisis in Gaza and the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute. The week also saw MEPs vote to ban certain pesticides to protect safety.
With the death toll rising in Gaza last week Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering led calls for an "immediate end of violence on both sides", with fellow MEPs echoing these sentiments all week.
The start of the year also saw many homes in eastern and central Europe without gas as Russia and the Ukraine became locked in a fierce dispute over gas supplies. Throughout the week MEPs voiced condemnation of the whole debacle, with a resolution having now being passed.
A decade of the euro was also marked with MEPs being joined by the President of the European Central Bank Jean Claude Trichet and Europe's Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquín Almunia to debate the impact of the currency.
The first session of the year also saw the Czech Republic's PM Mirek Topolánek come before the House to set the priorities of his country's 6-month presidency of the EU.
In other debates the House passed the resolution to ban harmful pesticides in a bid to increase safety. Also discussed was the introduction of biometric passports, humane animal transport across Europe and the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet.

1st Strasbourg session of 2009 opens: Pöttering on Gaza, safer pesticides debated
A Palestinian girl peers through a window, UN school in the Jebaliya refugee camp, Gaza, 12 Jan An immediate call to end the continued fighting in the Gaza strip and a plea on behalf of the civilian population in Gaza: These were the words with which Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering opened the first Strasbourg sitting of 2009. MEPs also debated two reports which aim to make pesticides less toxic.
In his opening remarks Mr Pöttering told MEPs that he hopes the European Parliament would be a force for peace in the year ahead. He also said that events during the European year of intercultural dialogue last year had shown that "there is no need for a clash of civilizations".
Pöttering on Gaza: "unacceptable for the civilian population to suffer"
Speaking on the escalation of conflict in Gaza he told the House that "there is a terrible case of déjà vu" in the whole situation. "The life of a Palestinian has the same value as the life of an Israeli" he said as he reiterated his earlier statement criticising Hamas for breaking the ceasefire and Israel for its disproportionate reaction. "It is unacceptable for the civilian population to continue to suffer" he added.
He called for an "immediate end of violence on both sides", urging a "viable and lasting" two-State solution "with Israel and Palestine as sovereign States within secure borders". He emphasised Parliament's support for the legally binding UN Security Council resolution of 8 January, which he said is currently not being respected by either side.
Against this background he nevertheless recalled that 2008 had been the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, a year "offering a sign of hope", demonstrating that there is "no need for a clash of civilisations".
MEPs will debate the situation in Gaza on Wednesday afternoon and vote on a resolution on Thursday.
Less toxic pesticides
Monday also saw MEPs debate two new EU-wide rules on pesticides. One aims to regulate the production and licensing of pesticides and another which will reduce the use of those pesticides already in existence.
The draft legislation will in due course ban the use of certain dangerous chemicals in these products. Measures to ensure the safer use of pesticides in daily life will also be introduced.
Hiltrud Breyer is the German Green MEP who steered the measure in Parliament. She said in Monday's debate that "this agreement is not only a milestone for the protection of both the environment and the consumer: it marks an historical moment. This agreement is the first of its kind in the whole world. Europe is a pioneer on a global scale".
Christa Klass is Parliament's rapporteur on reducing pesticide usage. The German EPP-ED Member said "the use of phyto-sanitary products must be reduced or blocked in residential areas and that this directive aims at protecting users, consumers and the environment". The issue will be put to the vote on Tuesday.
Other issues
Other issues debated on Monday included:
Urban Mobility/State aid for public broadcasting (oral questions)
Trade and economic relations with Western Balkans (report)
The Common Agricultural policy and Global Food Security (report)
Developing civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon (report)
Equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions (report)

Tuesday: The euro at 10, Latvia's President, Biometric passports
Valdis Zatlers told MEPs: “He who changes will survive” A decade of the euro was marked in Tuesday's Strasbourg session as MEPs and leading economic experts debated future challenges to the euro and its much publicised 10 year history. Later, Latvia's President Valdis Zatlers addressed the House and spoke of the changes his country has seen since joining the European Union in 2004. New biometric passports were also later debated.
A decade of the euro
To mark a decade of the European single currency a whole host of European figures attended Strasbourg to address the Chamber.
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering called the common currency "a bastion of economic stability". The President of the European Central Bank Jean Claude Trichet said the euro had given Europe "price stability" and that it protected "incomes and savings".
Latvia's President
Latvia's President Valdis Zatlers spoke of Latvia's accession into the European Union and NATO, changes the country had seen since independence in 1918 and also the financial crisis and Latvia's economy.
He also thanked the European Parliament for its official commemoration of the victims of Stalinism and Nazism.
New biometric passports debated
In June, 30 European countries will be required to issue passports with fingerprints and facial recognition software. The man who has drafted Parliament's report on the new measure - Portuguese MEP Carlos Coelho - said in Tuesday's debate that "there is real concern in the EP to fight trafficking of human beings and especially children – this is the main aim of this instrument".
MEPs also debated an own initiative report by Italian MEP Marco Cappato that says that "accessing information relating to the EU institutions still remains an obstacle-strewn path for ordinary citizens".
MEPs seal the deal on pesticides
MEPs backed overwhelmingly an agreement reached with the Council in December on the new EU pesticides legislation. The two new laws will increase the number of pesticides available on the market, while progressively banning the use of a number of dangerous chemicals in these products, and ensure the safer use of pesticides. In order to enter into force, laws still require a formal adoption by Member States' ministers at the Council.

Wednesday: Czech Presidency, Gaza, gas crisis
14 Jan: Czech PM Topolánek told MEPs he would focus on economics and energy The economy and energy security are two priorities of the incoming Czech Presidency of the Union according to Czech PM Mirek Topolánek who addressed the House Wednesday. Later MEPs debated the crisis in Gaza and the Russia-Ukraine gas stand-off.
Czech PM outlines 6-month programme
Mirek Topolánek began his six-month term of office by thanking the former French Presidency for its work: "it is not easy to take over the Presidency of the Council of the EU after France. I see only one way to rise to the occasion, with honour."
Topolánek's 3 E's
Outlining his goals for his Presidency, Topolánek made his priorities the economy, energy security and Europe's position in the world.
MEPs all agreed that the Presidency faced a tough inception due to the economic crisis.
Joseph Daul of the EPP-ED group said "the Czech presidency has become faced with difficulties and handling three crises. A united front is the only attitude we can adopt".
Socialist leader Martin Schulz told the House: "If the EU wants to continue its worldwide role, then Europe can't be fragmented into its individual elements. We need a strong unified block. We need a united voice."
Graham Watson of the Liberal ALDE group addressed the President directly saying: "Protect yourself not by fences, but by your friends. We are your friends. This is a union of friends, equals and partners. Stick to your objectives and we will stick by you".
The worsening crisis in Gaza
The afternoon session saw MEPs debate at length, the ever-troubling crisis in Gaza.
The overwhelming majority of voices across the House called for an immediate ceasefire in accordance with the recent UN resolution, with many recognising Israel’s right of self-defence but condemning the “disproportionate” scale of its intervention in Gaza.
Parliament will adopt a resolution on the Gaza conflict on Thursday, 15 January.
Europe intensifies pressure on Russia and the Ukraine over gas
With gas still not reaching many EU Members, European voices intensified in their call for a swift resolution. MEPs also rallied in the new need for a united common energy policy, creating long lasting stability for European energy.
Hanna Foltyn-Kubicka of the UEN group said that the gas crisis is a long-term one and that it is not just economic but political. "Behind Gazprom's demands is the political machinery of the Kremlin" she said.
István Szent-Iványi of ALDE also condemned the political dichotomy that was playing out: "There is still no gas, we cannot tolerate that Europe is being held hostage in a cynical game".
Other debates
The remainder of the session saw debates on the situation in the Horn of Africa. Europe's policy towards Belarus and whether to make 11 July a day of remembrance for the victims of the massacre in Srebrenica were also discussed by MEPs Wednesday.

Thursday: Animal transport, the Mediterranean diet and human rights
MEPs vote on a resolution on the crisis in the Middle East, Thursday 15 January Animals are still being transported across Europe in terrible conditions. That was the damning claim raised before the House in Thursday's session. Later MEPs discussed the details of the "Mediterranean Diet" and its possible recognition by the UN in acknowledgement of its healthy qualities.
The day concluded with human rights debates, and the adoption of 11 July as the day to commemorate the victims of Srebrenica.
Animal transport reform needed
Having already passed special European legislation on the welfare of animals during transportation, some countries are not obeying the rules.
Chair of the agriculture committee, British Conservative Member Neil Parish expressed special concern in relation to conditions of horse transportation. Reports highlight the long distances, overcrowded trucks and lack of water that the horses endure. He said: "a civilised society is judged not only according to how it treats people, but also animals".
Call to remember Srebrenica
MEPs adopted a resolution calling on all its members are countries that made up former Yugoslavia to mark 11 July a day of remembrance for the estimated 8,000 Bosnian men and boys murdered by Serb paramilitaries in Srebrenica in 1995.
The House also discussed breaches of human rights and the rule of law in Iran, Guinea and Kenya.
Echoing sentiments stressed all through the week, MEPs also called for a permanent ceasefire in the Middle East from both Israel and Hamas.
UNESCO and the Mediterranean Diet
In 2009 UNESCO will decide whether the Mediterranean Diet should be included on the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
The Chair of the agriculture committee and Christian democrat, Neil Parish urged the support of the Mediterranean (and other diets across Europe) as a part of cultural diversity of the EU. He added: "The Mediterranean diet helps to reduce all cardiovascular disease risks, Alzheimer's disease and cancer”.
MEPs committed themselves to safeguarding local and regional European food heritage in the face of the rising fast-food wave, calling the Mediterranean diet one of the "various elements of the European cultural model helping to survive against globalization and American foods."
