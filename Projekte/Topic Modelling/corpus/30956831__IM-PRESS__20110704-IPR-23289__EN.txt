Danish workers made redundant by LM Glasfiber and Odense Steel Shipyard will get help worth €20,429,316 from the EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund to find new jobs. The aid, approved by the European Parliament on Tuesday, will benefit 1,775 workers.
Denmark applied for €6,247,415 for former workers at LM Glasfiber and €14,181,901 for those at Odense Steel Shipyard. The aid will benefit 825 former workers at LM Glasfiber (where 1,650 employees lost their jobs) and 950 at Odense Steel (where 1,356 lost theirs).
Parliament approved the proposal for LM Glasfiber with 575 votes in favour, 60 against, and 25 abstentions.
It also approved that for Odense Steel Shipyard, with 575 votes in favour, 61 against, and 30 abstentions.
Parliament's approval was the final step, because the Council of Ministers had already given its approval, on 30 May.
