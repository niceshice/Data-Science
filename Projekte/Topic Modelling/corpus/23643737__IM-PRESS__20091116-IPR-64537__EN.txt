Delegations
2009-11-16 - 14:08
A seven-strong ad-hoc delegation of MEPs led by German MEP Doris Pack (EPP) visited Kosovo on the occasion of the first elections held under the sole responsibility of the Kosovo authorities on Sunday 15 November. Although the delegation's mandate was not to observe the election in a formal capacity, MEPs nonetheless visited several polling stations across the country, including some of the newly-established municipalities.
"We congratulate the people of Kosovo who undertook their responsibility and voted in Sunday's local elections. The delegation would like to single out the participation of Kosovo Serbs in the Southern part of the country. We hope that these elections will encourage the Serb minority to engage politically in Northern Kosovo where elections are foreseen for six months time. We would like also to praise the Central Election Commission for its role in organising the elections", said Ms Pack on the polls to elect municipal councils and mayors.
The ad-hoc delegation met government representatives (ministers Sadri Ferati and Sasa Rasic), members of the Central Election Commission and election candidates. It also met representatives of the international community, including EU Special Representative Pieter Feith and OSCE Ambassador Werner Almhofer.
The delegation was formed by Pier Antonio Panzeri (S&D, IT), Diana Wallis (ALDE, UK), Marietje Schaake (ALDE, NL), Marije Cornelissen (Greens/EFA, NL) and Jacek WÅ‚osowicz (ECR, PL).
