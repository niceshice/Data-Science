Ahead of today's voting session, Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek asked MEPs to observe a minute's silence in memory of Angelo Vassallo, mayor of Pollica, Campania, in Italy, who was murdered by the Camorra on Sunday.
"We must not underestimate the role of organised crime in some Member States", said the President. "We must stand together to root out this evil so that Angelo Vassallo's death will not have been in vain".
Mr Vassallo was known for fighting against construction development in protected areas.
