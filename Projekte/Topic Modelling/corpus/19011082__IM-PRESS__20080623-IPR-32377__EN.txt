The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, welcomed as a strong political signal the call by European Heads of State and Government meeting in Brussels for the Lisbon Treaty ratification process to go ahead in those countries that have not ratified.
President Pöttering added: "Now the Irish Government must further analyse the results of the Referendum. I really hope that on this basis at the next Summit on 15 October it will be possible to make concrete proposals and possibly outline a timetable of how to proceed. The aim is that the Treaty will have entered into force in time for the European Parliament elections in June 2009."
