Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo Ladies in White ¡Basta Ya! When you fight against oppression or harassment, you might find joining forces helpful. Several human rights activists realised that founding a group made them stronger. Your voice is louder and there is support in the fight. In the second of our Sakharov slideshows we look at groups who have fought for human rights.
Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo
Imagine that an oppressive dictatorship had kidnapped your son or daughter and you had received no information about them for years. This was the case of 14 Argentinian mothers. In 1977 they gathered together on the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires and decided to make an appeal to the then Argentinean president - the movement called Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo was formed.
For three decades, these mothers have sought to be reunited with their children. The movement evolved over time into a fight for an independent judicial system, political change, and peace. Every Thursday afternoon the mothers meet at the Plaza de Mayo and circulate for half an hour wearing white scarves as a symbol of peace. The European Parliament awarded their determination and courage in 1992.
Ladies in White
White is also symbolic for the Cuban "Ladies in White" movement. This group of mothers and daughters hold peaceful protests against the imprisonment of their husbands and sons, imprisoned for criticising the lack of political freedom in the country.
They became active in 2003 after the imprisonment of some 80 dissidents. First they concentrated on writing letters to the government. Then they decided to take to the streets. You can see them every Sunday at religious services in Havana, after which they walk outside calling for the liberation of their men. Dressed in white as a symbol of purity and innocence, "Ladies in White" are committed to respecting human rights, while also criticising the lack of freedom in politics within the country. The Ladies in White received the Sakharov Prize in 2005.
¡Basta Ya!
The majority of EU citizens live in peace, but this is not the case for those born in the north of Spain. People living in the Basque region have been victims of terrorist attacks since the 1960s. In defiance of the terrorists ¡Basta Ya! is made up of people and groups who mobilise others against terrorism. The group also offers support to the victims of terrorist attacks. ¡Basta Ya! received the Sakharov prize in 2000.
