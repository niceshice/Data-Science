The European Parliament approved on Tuesday eight applications for support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The funding is for 2,554 redundant workers in Slovenia, 1,181 in Germany, 2312 in Spain and 779 from Poland.
Slovenia applied for €2,247,940 in EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund Aid to help 2,554 former workers at the Mura European Fashion Design (clothing) company to find new jobs.
Germany applied for €8,308,555 in EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund Aid to help 1,181 former workers at Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG's printing machinery plants in Baden-Württemberg to find new jobs.
The Spanish authorities applied for €8,728,978 in European Globalisation Fund Aid for 2312 workers in three regions: Valencia (several firms in the construction and textile sector), Catalonia (the Lear company, producing electrical equipment for cars) and Aragón (several firms in the retail trade sector).
The two Polish applications amount to €747,327 for 779 ex-workers from the Wielkopolskie province (two firms in the car industry) and the H. Cegielski-Poznań company, the only Polish manufacturer of marine engines, plus its suppliers.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or the financial crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. The fund's annual ceiling is €500 million.
