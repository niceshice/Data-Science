Hans-Gert Pöttering leads a moment's silence for Italy's earthquake victims At the start of this week's Strasbourg plenary session, the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, expressed the EP's deep sympathy with the victims of the recent earthquakes in Abruzzo, Italy.
"We are all horrified at the violence of this natural disaster and its tragic consequences", said the president, referring to the 295 people who lost their lives. He expressed Parliament's deepest sympathy with all victims of the earthquake and their families as well as solidarity with Italy and the Italian people. The House then observed a minute's silence.
Announcements and agenda changes
President Pöttering informed the House that a written declaration on saying No to violence against women had received the support of over half the Members of Parliament and would thus be published in the minutes and forwarded to the addressees.
The House voted to make two changes to this week's agenda. The vote on a resolution on the protection of Arctic, scheduled for Wednesday, was removed from the agenda, on a proposal from Diana Wallis (ALDE, UK), who argued that Parliament had already taken a position on this matter.
At the suggestion of the UEN group, on Wednesday there will now be a Commission statement with debate on the earthquake in Abruzzo.
