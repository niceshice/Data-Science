Strengthening democratic scrutiny over EU external instruments
External relations
Plenary sittings
2010-10-21 - 13:45
Parliament approved proposals on Thursday to give MEPs a power of scrutiny over how the European Commission finances projects intended to promote stability in non-EU countries, improve cooperation with developing and other countries and promote democracy and human rights.
With the Lisbon Treaty in force, Parliament decides jointly with the Council on almost all new laws and this joint approach also needs to be reflected in democratic oversight of the implementation of external cooperation financing instruments.
Strategy papers for geographic and thematic programmes, as well as multiannual indicative programmes drafted by the Commission for the external co-operation instruments "shall be adopted by means of delegated acts", say amendments approved by the Foreign Affairs, Development and International Trade committees. This would give the European Parliament a de facto veto, by enabling it to block these strategy papers and multiannual programmes and require the Commission to present amended proposals.
All five reports were adopted at first reading without any agreement having been reached with the Council and Commission on the most contentious issue, relating to the application of delegated acts. However, during the debate on Wednesday, all three institutions underlined their intention to engage in trialogue negotiations in order to ensure that these financial instruments function properly.
