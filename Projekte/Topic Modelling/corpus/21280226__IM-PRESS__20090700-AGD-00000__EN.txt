Debate will focus on shaping regional and local development policy to tackle new challenges, including globalisation, climate change, population ageing and energy efficiency, after 2013.
Key issues - Maximising return on regional policy investment, e.g. by promoting synergies between regional and other policies and fostering co-ordination among decision-takers at EU, national, regional and local levels. - Improving governance and partnership, e.g. by decentralising management to regional and local authorities and stepping up involvement of other local stakeholders. - Fostering territorial cohesion and co-operation, e.g. between town and country, or even across borders: effects on differing national institutional systems, and relations among institutional players. - Simplifying management and building administrative capacity, e.g. to reduce administrative burdens on Member States or improve the effectiveness, efficiency or transparency of use of EU funds. Speakers will include Gerardo Galeote, Chair of the EP Regional Development Committee, Cyril Svoboda, Czech Minister for Regional Development, EU Council Presidency, Ivo Barek, Chair of Czech Senate Committee on Public Administration, Regional Development and the Environment, Dirk Ahner, European Commission Regional Development Director General and Marie Weibull Kornias, Swedish Parliament Trade and Industry Committee Member.
