MEPs voted in favour of the change of portfolio for Commission Vice-President Jacques Barrot, who is taking over responsibility for freedom, security and justice, by 489 votes in favour, 52 against and 19 abstentions. The House also voted in favour of the appointment of Antonio Tajani as the new Italian Commissioner to be responsible for transport, with 507 votes in favour, 53 against and 64 abstentions. Mr Tajani is now also a Vice-President of the Commission.
These changes follow the resignation of Franco Frattini, the previous Italian member of the Commission, who is now Foreign Minister in the Italian government. Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso asked Jacques Barrot of France, who has been Vice-President of the Commission since 2004, to take over Mr Frattini's role as Commissioner for Freedom Security and Justice, while Mr Barrot's former responsibility for transport passes to Mr Tajani.
Before today's vote, the two Commissioners faced hearings before the relevant Parliamentary committees on Monday evening. See the links below for more details.
