Briefing - 29-30 November 2006 - Brussels plenary session
2006-11-24 - 15:53
Research funding, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania and the EU's institutional future are among the main items for debate at the Brussels plenary session of 29-30 November 2006. MEPs will also discuss the outcome of the EU-Russia summit and EU funding to support democracy and human rights around the world.
The session opens on Wednesday afternoon with a debate with Bertie Ahern , Taoiseach of Ireland, who will discuss is vision for the future of Europe with MEPs. This is the second in an occasional series of debates with members of the European Council as part of the period of reflection following the 'no' votes in referendums in France and the Netherlands on the proposed EU constitution. MEPs will then debate their final reports on the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU, a few weeks before those countries join on 1 January 2007. Geoffrey VAN ORDEN (EPP-ED, UK) is the rapporteur for Bulgaria and Pierre MOSCOVICI (PES, FR) for Romania. Next, Parliament will look to the EU's influence on the international stage, as MEPs discuss at first reading a reform of the system for funding support for democracy and human rights around the world. The report on this subject was drawn up by Edward McMILLAN-SCOTT (EPP-ED, UK) and Hélène FLAUTRE (Greens/EFA, FR). Most of the rest of the evening will be devoted to discussion of all aspects of the EU's scientific research funding, with MEPs debating a series of reports on the Seventh Framework Programme .
Thursday's sitting falls the day before World AIDS Day , and AIDS is the subject of the first debate of the day, based on a statement from the Commission. MEPs will then move on to consider the situation of disabled people in the enlarged European Union, as they discuss the report from Liz LYNNE (ALDE, UK) on the issue. Among the items being put to the vote on Thursday will be a resolution on Europe's Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, following on from a debate held at the end of September. 20061122BRI00176

Green light for seventh framework research programme for 2007-2013
2006-11-24 - 15:53
At its plenary session of 29 and 30 November, the European Parliament is expected to give the go-ahead for the EU's research and development funding for the period 2007-2013, when MEPs debate and vote on 10 reports relating to the 7th Framework Research Programme (FP7). This programme, the EU's main instrument for funding scientific research, will have a budget of more than €54 billion over its seven-year life. As Parliament and Council have settled their main differences through a compromise package, FP7 should enter into force on 1 January 2007.
What is FP7?
The seventh programme is intended to build on the achievements of its predecessor by making further progress towards the creation of a European Research Area, the equivalent of a "common market" for research . The long-term goal is for the European Union to become the world’s leading research area.
Successive framework programmes ( FPs) have operated since 1984, each covering a five year period. The current programme - FP6 - expires at the end of 2006. However, FP7 will run for seven years - from 1 January 2007 to 2013 - so as to coincide with the EU's multiannual budget framework (the Financial Perspective).
Simpler instruments and procedures for funding and participation are a feature of FP7, which will promote collaborative research based on broad research areas, with much continuity from FP6 plus two new topics, space and security. Only projects involving several partners from different countries will be financed. The programme's funds are not general subsidies to research organisations or companies: they may only be used for specific work or research projects.
The 7th Framework Programme is organised around four Specific Programmes:
Co-operation: a programme to support cooperation between universities, industry, research centres and public authorities, and between the EU and third countries.
Ideas: a programme to create an autonomous European Research Council to support investigator-driven “frontier research”.
People : a programme to support training and career development of researchers.
Capacities: a programme focusing on the c oordination and development of research infrastructure, support for regional research clusters, SMEs, closer ties between science and society and international cooperation.
In addition, Specific Programmes will be set up for the Joint Research Centre (non-nuclear activities) and Euratom nuclear research and training activities.
Separately, the Euratom Framework Programme (which also has a Specific Programme) covers two areas: fusion energy research and nuclear fission and radiation protection.
Parliament's role
The European Parliament has joint legislative power with the Council (under the codecision procedure) on the main programme (FP7) and the rules for participation. It is only consulted on the Euratom programme and the various specific programmes.
Parliament strongly backed this legislation from the outset and made every effort to speed it through the legislative process. On 15 June, the EP adopted its first reading position on the main FP7 programme and its report on the Euratom part.
Many of Parliament's first-reading amendments were accepted by Council, including those aimed at encouraging participation by small and medium-sized firms and boosting the position of young researchers and women in science, and those dealing with stem cell research. The 39 new compromise amendments on which Parliament will vote on 30 November deal with the remaining issues which MEPs still wish to emphasise, including Parliament's priorities, the European Research Council and the proposed Risk Sharing Facility. Members also stress that no money from FP7 should be used to finance the proposed European Institute of Technology.
Parliament's priorities
MEPs are insisting on shifting some of the spending towards Parliament's own priorities, including research on renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the possibility of funding research on children's health, respiratory diseases (including those induced by allergies), plus research into neglected diseases.
The compromise states that renewables and end use energy efficiency will account for the "major part" of the budget of FP7's energy theme - rather than the two thirds proposed in Parliament's first reading. Special attention will be devoted to coordination of issues linked to rational and efficient use of energy within the Framework Programme and in other EU policies and programmes.
European Research Council
The compromise also includes amendments concerning the European Research Council - a new body to support investigator-driven “frontier research”.
It was agreed that the administration costs of the ERC should not exceed 5% of its total budget in order to maximise funding for frontier research - in its first reading Parliament had asked for a limit of 3%, to avoid top-heavy administration. On the question of how far Parliament should be involved in an interim evaluation of the ERC's structure, it was agreed that the codecision procedure would be used if changes in the structure of the ERC become necessary.
Ethical questions
Ethical issues were of great concern to all involved in the adoption of the programme, with opinions differing sharply. At its first reading Parliament adopted a compromise which the Council was able to accept (with opposition from a couple of Member States).
Parliament and Council agreed that all the research activities carried out under the Seventh Framework Programme must be carried out in compliance with fundamental ethical principles. Thus, no Community funding will be allowed for research aimed at human cloning for reproductive purposes or research intended to modify the genetic heritage of human beings. Nor will funds be available for research intended to create human embryos solely for the purposes of research or stem cell procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer.
Research on the use of human stem cells, both adult and embryonic, may be financed, depending both on the nature of the scientific proposal and the legal framework of the Member State(s) involved. As regards the use of human embryonic stem cells, institutions, organisations and researchers must be strictly licensed and controlled in accordance with the legal framework of the Member State(s) involved.
Risk Sharing Facility and European Institute of Technology
The Risk Sharing Finance Facility, designed to encourage bank lending to research projects, is also part of the second-reading compromise. The Council had planned to allocate €1 billion from FP7 to finance the RSFF (to be matched by an equal amount from the European Investment Bank) but now the compromise provides for a lower contribution from FP7 until 2010 - €500 million - with the possibility of releasing up to an additional €500 million after an evaluation process.
The Industry Committee has meanwhile stressed that no FP7 funds should contribute to the establishment or administrative costs of the European Institute of Technology. Only administrative costs directly associated with research projects may be covered.
Budget
The overall budget planned for the 7th Framework Programme in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is €54 582 million in current prices. Of this, €50 521 million is for the European Community programme and €2751 million for the Euratom programme, which runs from 2007 to 2011. A further €1310 million is indicatively planned for the Euratom programme for 2012-2013 but this will need to be confirmed at a later stage.

Enlargement
Bulgaria and Romania all set to join the EU
2006-11-24 - 15:53
With the EU about to enlarge the size of its family to 27 members when Romania and Bulgaria join on 1 January 2007, Parliament takes a final opportunity to review the situation of these countries ahead of their accession and to draw attention to areas where action is still needed. The two reports are being tabled to the plenary by the Foreign Affairs Committee. Bulgaria
The Foreign Affairs Committee welcomes Bulgaria's accession but notes that there are areas "that require further progress". In a resolution drawn up by Geoffrey van Orden (EPP-ED, UK) and adopted by 44 votes to 0, with 2 abstentions, MEPs mention the need for maximum transparency in every sector, a stronger role for the Ombudsman, rigorous implementation of measures to improve the training of police investigators, the coordination of anti-corruption policies and a strengthening of inspectorates within public administrations. Also, specialised police units for the fight against organised crime, corruption, drugs and human trafficking should be expanded.
Points of some concern are the conditions in children's homes and other institutional care and the protection of minorities. However, MEPs welcome the progress made on the trade in live animals and animal welfare, such as in the transportation and slaughter of animals and the treatment of animal by-products.
On the economic front, the Foreign Affairs Committee expresses concern at "continuing invisible barriers to foreign investors", urging the Bulgarian government to take measures to ensure a "positive investment climate". With regard to energy, MEPs recognise the sacrifice Bulgaria will have to make in closing units 3 & 4 of the Kozloduy nuclear plant and they ask the Council to consider a delay of eight months in order to allow for a review. They "recognise that that not just Bulgaria, but countries throughout Europe are facing an energy gap in the years ahead, with increasing reliance on import of energy from Russia and areas of instability".
Romania Romania's accession is also welcomed in a report by Pierre Moscovici (PES, FR) which was adopted by 51 votes to 0, with 1 abstention. The Romanian authorities are congratulated on the extensive progress made in a short time but also reminded to keep up the pace of reform after accession. MEPs say that the other EU member states should open up their borders to Romanian workers.
The Foreign Affairs Committee recognises the progress made on minorities but says that the law on minorities should be approved as soon as possible and that efforts on the protection of minorities, children and the mentally handicapped should be stepped up. With regard to the Roma minority, Romania is urged to "consolidate the reforms it has undertaken" and to ensure adequate funding. On the Hungarian minority MEPs say that adequate funding should be provided for the improvement of education standards.
The Foreign Affairs Committee notes that the Commission has also stressed the need for further progress in the fight against corruption, the absorption of agricultural funds and the application of EU legislation on food safety. Also, Romania should speed up the processing of claims relating to the restitution of properties confiscated by the communist regime and should make further efforts to protect the environment, with special reference to the mining in Rosia Montana.
Finally, MEPs insist that after accession Parliament must be further involved in the monitoring process regarding both Bulgaria and Romania.

Future of Europe/European integration
Bertie Ahern to debate future of Europe with MEPs
2006-11-24 - 15:53
Bertie Ahern, Taoiseach of Ireland, will join MEPs for a debate on the future of Europe with MEPs at the start of the plenary session. As part of the period of reflection on the future of Europe following the ‘no’ votes in the referendums in France and the Netherlands on the proposed EU constitution, Parliament decided that an occasional series of plenary debates with members of the European Council (i.e. the EU’s heads of state or government). The first of these took place in May 2006, when Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt set out his views.

External relations
EU-Russia summit in Helsinki
2006-11-24 - 15:53
The Council and Commission will report to Parliament on the outcome of the EU-Russia summit hosted on 24 November by Finland, which currently holds the EU Presidency. The EU delegation to the summit was led by Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen and the Russian delegation by President Vladimir Putin. The EU was also represented by Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana.
Amid discord over Russia's ban on Polish food exports, Friday's summit failed to reach a decision to launch negotiations for a new framework agreement between the EU and Russia to replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement, which expires in 2007.
T he two sides endorsed the outcome of the negotiations on the phasing-out of charges for overflying Siberia. Among other issues discussed were energy policy and the situations in Iran, the Middle East and North Korea.
Northern Dimension
In parallel to the EU-Russia summit, a separate high-level Northern Dimension meeting took place, between the EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland. This meeting approved a Framework Document and Political Declaration as the new basis for the Northern Dimension.

Human rights
Funding to support democracy and human rights
2006-11-24 - 15:53
After a year of pressure from the European Parliament, in July the Commission finally presented a proposal for a financial instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights. MEPs want to adjust its aims and scope. They are also proposing changes to make it faster and more efficient in responding to urgent developments. MEPs will be debating a report drawn up by Hélène FLAUTRE (Greens/EFA, FR) and Edward McMILLAN-SCOTT (EPP-ED, UK), and compromise amendments which have emerged from negotiations with the Council on the legislative proposal aimed at updating the EU's financial mechanism for supporting human rights and democracy around the world. This is the only instrument which allows funds to be allocated direct to civil society organisations without the agreement of the government of the third country concerned.
According to the EU Treaty, developing and strengthening democracy and the rule of law, as well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, are among the goals of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The co-rapporteurs believed it was essential for the EU to have an effective instrument to further these goals, one which would be both strategic and flexible and which would complement other funding mechanisms, such as the Stability Instrument and the geographic funding programmes.
In order to work effectively, the new mechanism need to be more flexible than that which it is replacing. It needs in particular to avoid excessively bureaucratic procedures which placed severe constraints on the capacity to reach to difficult situations.
The two co-rapporteurs have therefore tried to refocus the objectives and scope of the instrument so it is centred on support for non-state players promoting democracy and human rights. They have insisted on new measures to allow the EU to respond quickly and effectively to emergency situations which often face human rights defenders. They therefore introduced ad-hoc measure to allow funding to protect and support human rights defenders in urgent cases with going through a tendering process.
In parallel, changes to the Financial Regulation, aimed at allowing funding of unregistered organisations, should allow more flexibility in the operation of the mechanism better to support independent players active in defending freedom in third countries. This should overcome some of the weaknesses in the existing system for which the Commission has been criticised in the past.
The promotion of political pluralism and parliamentary democracy, and support for parliamentary projects in favour of democracy and human rights, were also added to the mechanism by MEPs in the committee.
Parliament's role in the setting of strategic priorities and in the operation of the instrument was one of the main issues subject to negotiations between the EP, Council and Commission. The co-rapporteurs succeeded in getting agreement on the setting up of a dialogue on these issues, though the Council has refused to make a formal commitment to take part. It is proposed that Parliament should receive an annual report, evaluation reports and the minutes of the Human Rights and Democracy Committee. It is also proposed that there should be a Commission/Parliament working group.
If the compromise texts are approved, the legislation can be adopted at this first reading stage, and the instrument will enter force by the end of the year, thereby preventing a break in EU funding for human rights and democracy, notable including electoral observation missions.
After three months of negotiation with the Council, the co-rapporteurs have managed to get a compromise which takes on board almost all of Parliament's requirements. Only three issues remain to be agreed. The compromise amendments presented at the plenary session will reflect the state of play in the continuing negotiations at that time.
The co-rapporteurs believe more time may be needed for negotiations, so while the debate is likely to go ahead this week, Parliament may decide to postpone the vote on the report to its December session in Strasbourg.

Social policy
Disabled people in the enlarged EU
2006-11-24 - 15:53
An own-initiative report on the situation of disabled people in the enlarged EU will be debated on Thursday. Access to public transport and information technologies are vital for disabled people, says the report, drafted for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee by Liz Lynne (ALDE, UK). It also calls for better integration of disabled people into mainstream education and the job market as well as a European charter on quality of support for disabled people. The report is a response to a Commission paper titled "The situation of disabled people in the enlarged European Union: the European Action Plan 2006-2007", which is the second phase of the EU Disability Action Plan.
Among other proposals, MEPs point out that for air travel, disabled people and those with reduced mobility already have rights under EU law. They want the Commission to extend similar rights to disabled people for all modes of transport.
Moves by the Commission to improve access to information and communication technologies are welcomed but the report notes that 80% of public websites, including those of the EU institutions, are generally not accessible to people with disabilities. It also stresses that all EU documentation should be available on demand in accessible formats.
The Commission should work with Member States to integrate disabled people from an early age into mainstream education wherever possible, and should study the idea of establishing a right to mainstream education for disabled children and their families if they wish it.
Information campaigns are needed, say MEPs, to raise awareness amongst employers of their responsibilities and to overcome any prejudices they may have about employing a disabled person. Efforts to move away from the institutionalisation of disabled people are welcomed but the report emphasises that this requires a sufficient level of community-based back-up services. To this end, the Commission is asked to press for a European charter on quality of support for disabled people.

Industry
Creating a Europe of entrepreneurship and growth
2006-11-24 - 15:53
The Industry Committee is tabling an own-initiative report by Pillar del Castillo Vera (EPP-ED, ES) called "Time to move up a gear - Creating a Europe of entrepreneurship and growth". MEPs argue that if the EU is to compete in a global market it must promote a knowledge-based society, foster entrepreneurship amongst Europeans and remove obstacles to business creation. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - those with fewer than 250 employees - are crucial. There are some 23 million SMEs in the EU, providing around 75 million jobs and hence 70% of EU employment but only 44% of these firms innovate in-house.
The report "commends the aims of the EU Market Access Strategy and calls for the EU to do more to promote its database amongst the SME community and to keep it up-to-date". It also calls for the authorities to create common 'one-stop information shops' for businesses and to encourage E-government.
It is also important to establish "SMEs clusters around technology parks, public laboratories or universities in other to create dynamic environments in Europe, able to exploit scientific knowledge and to create knowledge-based jobs".
Regulation needs to be improved and tax breaks and reduced interested loans introduced. Given the ageing population (over the next ten years over a third of European entrepreneurs are expected to retire), MEPs advocate cutting red tape to facilitate the transfer of family businesses to third parties or employees, thus preserving jobs and capital.
In a similar vein, the Commission and Member States are urged "to respect the principle of proportionality and flexibility when considering EU employment legislation", since "non-wage costs are one of the major obstacles facing one-person enterprises in employing additional workers".
Lastly, MEPs call on Member "to raise the profile of entrepreneurship and individual responsibility, rewarding effort, encouraging the social value of risk-taking and entrepreneurship".

Agreement likely on pan-EU firework rules
2006-11-24 - 15:53
EU-wide rules on the sale of fireworks are set to be adopted by Parliament after an agreement in informal discussions with the Council on the issue. A set of compromise amendments will be tabled, which, if adopted, will mean the legislative process can be completed at this first reading stage. Under the proposed compromise, negotiated in informal discussions between the rapporteur Joel HASSE FERREIRA (PES, PT) and the Council, the directive would be classify fireworks in four categories according to use, purpose, hazard and – as MEPs proposed – noise level, which should never be harmful for human health. Members also backed a system of minimum age restrictions for potential buyers or users:
Category 1 (safest) fireworks would not be available to consumers below 12 years old.
Category 2 fireworks: 16 years.
Category 3: 18 years.
Category 4 fireworks -- which present a high hazard -- would only be available to persons "with specialist knowledge".
The proposed directive would also contain a number of provisions on essential safety requirements. Manufacturers would have to submit their product to a "conformity assessment" procedure, affix the CE marking, and ensure that each pyrotechnic is tested under realistic conditions.
In 2004, 96% of fireworks on the market are imported from China. It is with this in mind -- and as to ensure that products comply with EU safety requirements -- that MEPs backed an amendment whereby importers would have to ensure that their non-EU-based supplier "has fulfilled his obligations under this Directive". Otherwise, importers would have to "assume these obligations [themselves]" Rapporteur Joel HASSE FERREIRA PES PT A6-0289/2006 Report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles Procedure: Co-decision, first reading
