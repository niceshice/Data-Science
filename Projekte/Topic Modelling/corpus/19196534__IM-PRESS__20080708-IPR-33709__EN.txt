Parliament is concerned that the lack of transparency of certain sovereign wealth funds does not allow a proper understanding of their structures and motivations. It wants to see a global code of conduct and for the Commission to examine what measures might be taken under EU law to improve the situation.
In a resolution adopted by 661 votes in favour, 11 against and 23 abstentions, MEPs ask the Commission to work closely with the IMF and OECD to establish a global code of conduct for Sovereign Wealth Funds (state owned investment funds from around the world). But the Commission should also monitor SWF activities and play a coordinating role in ensuring national initiatives do not go against the commitment to openness to investments or endanger the EU's position on global markets.
Parliaments say the Commission and Council should examine what legislative or other tools the EU has regarding transparency requirements, voting rights, shareholders' rights and golden shares that could allow reactions to ownership problems following SWF intervention. It wants to check the options for coordinated EU-level action.
MEPs also call on the Commission and Council to conduct an in-depth analysis of the functioning of global financial markets, defining a strong EU vision or what should be the principles and rules guiding their functioning.
