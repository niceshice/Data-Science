Strasbourg: A red carpet welcomes awaits the Indian President
To mark the first ever visit of an Indian President to the European Parliament, we take a look at relations between the world's largest democracy and the EU. Both India and the Union combine enormous cultural, linguistic and religious diversity. This focus includes some facts Parliament's President would like you to know about India, a look at the growing EU-India relationship, a profile of its President and an interview with the head of Parliament's delegation to India - Neena Gill.
There are strong cultural links between India and the EU. Some 3 million Indians - or people of Indian descent - live in the EU, while 30,000 Europeans live there. India's strength could well be her people. In 2020 the average age in the EU will be 45, in India it will be 29. This is the year by which India's President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has pledged that it will be an economically developed nation. If you wish to know more about India please read on; to hear the Indian President address MEPs live at 1200 CET on Wednesday 25 April click on the first link below.

President Pöttering on India
On the launch pad: India's space programme goes commercial, April 2007 A few things worth remembering about India - an interview with the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, on the occasion of the visit by President Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam , President of India, to Parliament in Strasbourg.
India is an increasingly important partner for the EU. What is today's India like? President Pöttering tells us why we should sit up and take notice of India.
How would you sum up India in just five sentences?
That is a difficult task. India has one of the world's oldest civilisations, aged some 5000 years. The Indian subcontinent has long been a region of historic trade routes and vast empires. Down through the centuries, there were numerous cultural influences, including Arabic, Ottoman Turkish and British, which have all contributed to the modern Indian reality. After two world wars, the non-violent resistance led by Gandhi and Nehru brought independence in 1947. Today India is a thriving democracy, with a rich background and culture.
What about Indian democracy?
India is the most populous democracy in the world with well over 1 billion people. The country has 28 federal states, 7 union territories and 23 official languages. The healthy state of Indian democracy is a good example to be held up in the region and the EU and India can certainly work together to promote democratic values in Asia.
What do you think of the so-called Indian economic wonder?
India is set to be one of the globalised world's great new economic powerhouses. Recent economic growth has been 8% per year...services are the major source of economic growth, accounting for more than half of India's output with less than one third of its labour force. India is producing more science graduates than Europe. It has its own "Silicon Valley" in Bangalore and exports software engineers worldwide. As we have seen, its large companies now bid for major European enterprises. European business is more and more aware of the opportunities presented by this new economic situation.
Despite its dynamism, India remains a land of contrasts
India's GDP per capita is roughly an eighth of the EU average. However, with its impressive growth and famed entrepreneurial spirit, the country is fast catching up. As is often the case when a country experiences rapid economic growth, there is a time-lag before the benefits of the growth are experienced by the whole population. In India's case, 25% of the population remains below the poverty line. In education, while Indian graduates are in worldwide demand, the under-15 literacy ratio is less than 60%. So internally there is still a massive challenge to overcome, which no doubt the Indian authorities are acutely conscious of.
Is the new economic situation changing Indian society?
Economic growth and large scale emigration generally contribute to significant social change. The democratic government of India is working hard to eliminate such practices as arranged marriages and caste system discrimination. Women's rights are still a big issue in India.
How do you evaluate the Indian contribution to popular culture?
The foundations of ancient philosophy, and a rich cultural heritage serve as a source of constant inspiration for modern thinkers, artists and scientists. But Indian influence is also present in popular culture and everyday life. Indian cuisine, art and music are everywhere in Europe's towns and cities. And then there's "Bollywood", of course, a great movie-making industry which is gaining more and more enthusiasts in Europe where Bollywood movies have become a regular feature in our cinemas.

Europe and India - both united in diversity
India: an international economic player India has the honour of being the world's largest democracy. With economic growth around 8% a year, the importance of India to the global economy is set to increase in coming years. India currently has a "strategic partnership" with the EU - her largest trading partner. As her President Dr.A.P.J. Abdul Kalam visits the Parliament, we take a look at India and its relations with the EU.
With its large population India is the second most populous on the planet after China and the world's largest democracy.
India: "crossroads between...Far East and energy-rich Middle East…"
A resolution adopted last year by Parliament said that "India is an emerging leader at the geopolitical centre of gravity: the crossroads between the booming Far East and energy-rich Middle East and Central Asia". India has an economy that is growing at a around 8% a year with the EU being India's biggest trading partner and the largest source of India's foreign direct investment. Although relations are good there are some tensions over high import tariffs on some European goods and India would like to see a reduction in "non-tariff barriers" - like trade defence actions and restrictions on the movement of people. India is particularly strong in the IT sector, with a 44% share of globally traded IT services and "outsourcing". In this sector wages are $8,000 compared with $70,000 for an equivalent job in Germany, for example 3 million people of Indian descent in EU
There are strong cultural links between India and the EU. Some 3 million Indians - or people of Indian descent - live in the EU while 30,000 European expatriates live there. India's strength could well be her people. In 2020 in the EU the average age will be 45, in India it will be 29. She will have a large pool of young and well-qualified people.
There are also strong academic links between India and the EU. The Erasmus scholarship scheme and the Jean Monnet Chair in European Studies at the University of Delhi are helping to build academic ties. Parliament is strongly committed to good relations with India. The Parliament resolution also restated the EP's call for an annual parliamentary summit either before or alongside the annual EU-Indian summit. Watch the formal sitting live !
Profile: Indian President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam
Indian President A.P.J Abdul Kalam On Wednesday A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will become the first Indian President to address the European Parliament. Since being elected the 11th Indian President in 2002 he has put science and technology at the centre of his aspiration to make India a developed economic nation by 2020. As well as these he has concentrated on India's youth - this is especially important as 55% of the population was born in the last 30 years.
President Kalam sees science and technology as a way of tackling poverty in India. He has been quoted in the media as saying that "nearly a quarter of the country's population could be moved out of poverty if the government continued to back technology as the source of growth". In a country of 1.1 billion, such an achievement would bring untold improvements.
Before being President, a rocket; then missile scientist
Born in Tamil Nadu in 1931 he graduated in aeronautical engineering in 1958 from the Madras Institute of Technology.
From 1962 he worked at the Indian Space Research Organisation. The team he worked with eventually successfully launched several satellites, including the launch vehicle which put a satellite in orbit in 1980. In a sign of how this work continues, on Monday India launched a space satellite.
For two decades Mr Kalam worked on guided missiles at the Defence Research and Development Organisation. He later worked as an advisor to the Indian Defence Minister and the Prime Minister. According to the President's website he led the development of strategic missile systems and later the nuclear test in 1998 - a test affirming India's status as a nuclear power.
Away from politics
His website notes that away from politics his hobbies include gardening, poetry and reading and writing books. As well as intellectual interests, the President is also keen to be an active Commander in Chief of the Indian Armed Forces - he has flown in a fighter jet and been in a submarine.

Neena Gill MEP: EU can learn from diversity of India
Neena Gill MEP: Chair of Parliament's India delegation For the first time in its history the European Parliament has formed a delegation for relations with India, distinct from the delegation for South Asia. The India delegation is headed by British Socialist Neena Gill who said the new delegation is "a sign of how much importance we attach to relations with India". In an exclusive interview with the Parliament's website, we asked her about Europe's relationship with India.
What aspect of EU-India relations should the Parliament concentrate on?
Clearly for us the political aspect is the most important one. Whilst we've had cooperation agreements for the last 30 years or so, one of the key aspects of the new strategic partnership is the political dimension, so for Parliament what we have to do is develop that particular relationship, but to do so we also need the Indians to reciprocate. The Parliamentary dimension has been much slower than the intergovernmental relationship, but I believe the formation of the India delegation really symbolises how the relationship is developing and is really a first step in putting the political dialogue on a much better footing
On the need for Joint Parliamentary Meeting
I think it's absolutely essential that we have some kind of Parliamentary meeting prior to the annual EU-India Summit. We are not really going to achieve many of the ambitions stated in the strategic partnership if MPs don't have a full understanding of the issues both sides are confronting, and, if I was totally frank, I would say that there are huge shortcomings on both sides. There are many misconceptions about India and vice-versa. If you go to the Indian Parliament there is not a huge amount of understanding of all the players in the European Union and the issues we are confronting. There is a huge amount of focus on bilateral relationships and really we need to get the EU understood.
As her economy grows, what can Europe do to persuade Indian to reduce CO2 emissions?
We have amazing technology and technological know-how in renewables and we can assist India in formulating some sort of strategy which is really more focused on renewable energy. We need to transfer our know-how but also to make other resources available because there are huge challenges in India and it is difficult sometimes to get across the message of energy efficiency when someone is struggling to feed their family. There's a huge amount of poverty that we mustn't forget in India, so we could assist with programmes that enable people to find a better livelihood at the same time as being energy efficient. I was very encouraged in the Energy Globe Awards last week - one of the projects that won was in India and part-financed by Denmark.
Turning to the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan, should the EU get involved?
India sees this as a bilateral rather than an international issue. We have an own initiative report and the Parliament will make its position clear on the issue in time.
What are the similarities between the European Union and India?
When I go to India MPs often joke that "oh, you are catching up with us" - You've got approaching 500 million we've got a billion, we have 28 states - the EU has 27". In India, states have different languages, different religions and in very many ways we have a lot in common. It is the only example of a secular state with that level of diversity. There is a lot the EU can learn from India due to this diversity. What India demonstrates is that people feel quite comfortable being Maharashtran (a native of the state on Maharashtra) and Indian.
Also the EU could learn from India's entrepreneurial spirit - after all we are spending lots of money saying that Europeans need to be more entrepreneurial.
Neena Gill will hold talks with the Indian President during his visit to the Parliament on Wednesday 25 April, when he will address the plenary session.
