In a resolution on the on the employment targets to be achieved by EU Member States, MEPs argue that the employment rate should be increased to 75% by 2020, with a peculiar focus on vulnerable groups. They also call for legislation on atypical forms of employment, such as part-time, casual, temporary and fixed-term contract work.
Member States should reduce unemployment and increase the employment rate to 75% of the active population by 2020, with the aim of reaching full employment, MEPs said in a resolution on the employment guidelines, drafted by Csaba Öry (EPP, HU) and adopted by 40 votes to 2 with 7 abstentions. The employment guidelines are an instrument of the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs that provides targets to be achieved by Member States in the field of employment and social inclusion.
In addition to the Commission's proposal, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs added employment sub-targets for specific groups: 90% of the 15-24 year-old women and men should be either in education, training or employment. In addition, Member States should increase the employment rate by 10% by 2014, focusing on particular groups: young people aged 15-25, older workers aged 50-64, unskilled women workers, people with disabilities and people with migrant backgrounds.
High minimum standards for job quality are essential so as to eradicate poverty among employed people, underlines the resolution. MEPs also call for the Commission to set a legislative framework for non-standard forms of employment (part-time, casual, temporary and fixed-term contract work).
Poverty
Governments should set their national targets to reduce by 25% the number of Europeans living below national poverty lines, lifting over 20 million people out of poverty, MEPs recommend. They should pay special attention to the growing group of working poor and to child poverty.
To boost income security at various stages of life, Member States should also ensure adequate minimum incomes that should be at least above the poverty line, argues the resolution.

An informal meeting is scheduled with the Belgian Presidency on Thursday 15 July. Parliament will vote in plenary in Strasbourg on September I and the EU Presidency will formally adopt the employment guidelines in October.
