The delegation visiting the sculptor Anthony Gormley's "Another Place" A delegation from the Parliament's Culture and Education Committee visited Liverpool, current European Capital of Culture, from 29 September to 1 October. MEPs Maria Badia, Domenico Antonio Basile, Nicodim Bulzesc Mary Honeyball, Christa Prets and Hannu Takkula took part.
In a packed programme they discussed with the City's key cultural leaders, including the Liverpool 08 team, how being chosen Capital of Culture had affected Liverpool's agenda and provided a focus for regeneration, publicity and promotion and helped give a new sense of pride and boost to morale to a city which contains some of the greatest areas of dereliction and deprivation in the EU. The city has also put together an innovative research model, Impacts 08 , which for the first time will try to understand and measure how winning Capital of Culture can provide benefits in terms of social, cultural, economic and environmental effects not just during the capital of cultural year itself but on an ongoing basis.
In addition to a series of presentations and discussion meetings the Committee was able to tour the city to view a range of projects including installation art within various different communities.
Liverpool is one of the members in the EU Cities on the Edge project which brings together Gdansk, Marseilles, Bremen, Naples and Istanbul in a collaborative series looking at how these port cities which suffered similar fates in the twentieth century as technology overtook the need for man in world trade and transport are struggling to find new roles. Will they join the modern globalised world or resist it to keep their distinctively "edgy" characters formed by earlier eras of globalisation?
The Delegation visited the Maritime and Slavery Museums, Tate gallery, various elements of the Liverpool Biennial, the Le Corbusier exhibition, the Liverpool Philharmonic, Hope University, the European Opera Centre and the Town Hall. EUCLID, the UK's EU Cultural Contact point used its local expertise and knowledge to help put the programme together.
