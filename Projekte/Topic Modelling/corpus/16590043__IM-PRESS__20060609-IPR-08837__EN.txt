In adopting a joint resolution on the revised sustainable development strategy, the European Parliament expresses its disappointment at the lack of progress in developing and following up the Sustainable Development Strategy adopted in GÃ¶teborg in 2001.
MEPs consider that the Commission's platform for action on the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy is overly cautious and weak, and in its present form will not succeed in mobilising public opinion and policy-makers behind the vital tasks that lie ahead.
The House welcomes, however, the valuable work of the Austrian Presidency in seeking to re-launch the Sustainable Development Strategy, in strengthening the proposals from the Commission, in pulling together existing targets and indicators within a single and more coherent framework, and also in attempting to put forward some new concepts.
