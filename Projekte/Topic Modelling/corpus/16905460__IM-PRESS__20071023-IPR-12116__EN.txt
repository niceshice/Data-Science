Audiovisual record and translation of all debates in plenary
Parliament's Rules of Procedure
2007-10-24 - 13:32
MEPs decided to ensure that all parliamentary proceedings are covered in all 23 official languages. MEPs also want to make the recordings of each sitting available for the public in all languages and via the Internet. By approving the report by Richard Corbett (PES, UK) by 586 in favours, 94 against and 17 abstentions, the Parliament amended its Rules of Procedure so that, after each plenary sitting, a verbatim report of the proceedings is made available in all official languages.
Moreover, the EP will produce and store the complete audiovisual recording of all sittings, which will include the soundtracks from all interpretation booths. The latter will be put on the Parliament's website and be accessible to the public.
Currently, the verbatim reports are delivered only in the 11 old official languages, as a transitory regime. Therefore, MEPs decided to end this practice and come back to full multilingual regime. The new rules will apply as from next plenary sitting, on 12 November.
All European Parliament plenary sessions are broadcast live in 23 languages via the European Parliament's website and previous sessions can also be accessed on demand via the link hereunder.
