Briefing for Brussels mini-plenary 30 November-1 December 2005
2005-11-25 - 12:34
The two-day Brussels plenary session of 30 November -1 December will see MEPs deal with topics from sport to VAT, from the WTO to bird flu.
The session will open on Wednesday with a debate on the WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December, with MEPs due to adopt a resolution setting out their expectations for the world trade talks. A debate on human rights in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam follows, before MEPs turn to sporting matters, notably support for an Olympic truce. Reinforcing measures to protect against bird flu and a deal to allow developing countries to import generic medicines needed to combat major public health problems will also feature.
Before the votes at 11am, Thursday's sitting will be devoted to a debate on VAT, including the future of the scheme allowing reduced rates for some labour intensive services.

Parliament looks ahead to WTO Hong Kong meeting
2005-11-25 - 12:34
MEPs will debate plans for the WTO talks in December after hearing statements from the Commission and the Council on the subject.
12-18 December in Hong Kong will see a Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organisation. This was originally intended to be the point at which the broad political outlines of a deal on the Doha Development Round would be decided, with the details to be sorted out in further talks in the year ahead. All side are now making determined efforts to reduce expectations of what could be agreed at the meeting. Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson told the MEPs in the International Trade Committee on 23 November that the aim was now for nothing more that a "softer landing." It now looks likely that the hard decisions will be postponed until further talks in 2006.
MEPs will vote on a resolution setting out Parliament's expectations of the meeting on Thursday.
A delegation of 30 MEPs will be in Hong Kong to take part in the Ministerial Meeting and in a parallel meeting of the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO.

MEPs set to back moves to simplify exports of generic drugs to poorer countries
2005-11-25 - 12:34
The European Union must do everything it can to enable the world's poorest people to have access to medicines. This is the main thrust of a report by Johan VAN HECKE (ALDE, BE) for the International Trade Committee on a draft regulation on compulsory licensing for the export of generic medicines to developing countries. This is now to be debated by the plenary. What problem is this legislation trying to tackle? Under the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), countries with major public health problems can issue "compulsory licences" for the manufacture of patent-protected drugs. But most developing countries do not have a pharmaceuticals industry to produce the generic drugs. On 14 November 2001, a declaration was adopted at Doha, during the WTO ministerial conference, to make the application of TRIPS more flexible not only for developing countries without the manufacturing capability but also for exporting countries. A decision of the WTO General Council of 30 August 2003 lays down the conditions under which countries without manufacturing capabilities can import generics that are still patent-protected. It also allows manufacturing countries to export drugs under a compulsory licence even where these drugs are patent-protected on their territory.
The European Commission's draft regulation is intended to transpose the decision of 30 August 2003 into Community law. It lays down conditions for the granting of compulsory licences for the manufacture in Europe of generic drugs intended for export to developing countries. The text is based on a multilateral decision, so the EU institutions have only limited freedom for manoeuvre as it was not easy to agree a compromise within the WTO and, in Mr Van Hecke's words, "we must not open a Pandora's box".
The Trade Committee adopted its position on the proposals in July. Since that time Mr Van Hecke and representatives of the Council have been involved in informal negotiations aimed at reaching a compromise text to allow the measure to be adopted at first reading. This has led to a set of compromise amendments which will now put to the vote directly at the plenary session.
Rapporteur Johan Van Hecke ALDE BE A6-0242/2005 FINAL REPORT on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on compulsory licensing of patents relating to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products for export to countries with public health problems Procedure: Codecision (1st reading)

Sport
Olympic truce and sport for development
2005-11-25 - 12:34
MEPs will hold a debate on sport, based around three oral questions.
The first, from Nikolaos SIFUNAKIS (PES, EL) for the Culture Committee is for the Council:
Prior to the Olympic and Paralympic Games 2004 in Athens, the International Olympic Committee established an International Olympic Truce Foundation and an International Olympic Truce Centre to revive the idea of the Olympic Truce. The tradition of a Truce, which dates back to the ancient Hellenic Olympic Games and which was observed for more than twelve centuries, entailed a cessation of all hostilities during the Games and conveyed a message of peace. The Foundation and Truce Centre were set up to discuss conflict resolution and to emphasise the role of sport in society.
In its resolution P5_TA(2004)0270(1) of 1 April 2004, the European Parliament called on the Council to support the efforts of the International Olympic Committee to promote the ideals of peace and human understanding through sport. The European Parliament also urged the Council to reconsider this matter every two years, prior to all Summer and Winter Olympic Games, and to reaffirm its support for the Olympic Truce initiative before the Games to be held in Turin, Italy, in February 2006.
Will the Council confirm its support for an Olympic Truce during the Turin Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games?
What tangible steps will it take to ensure that the Olympic Truce is observed?
Will the Council invite all Member States, applicant and neighbouring countries, and all countries participating in the Olympic Games to respect and observe the Olympic Truce during the Winter 2006 Olympics and Paralympics and thereafter?
The other questions, to the Commission and Council, are tabled by Maria MARTENS (EPP-ED, NL) for the Development Committee:
'Sport can play a vital role in encouraging development. Sport can bring benefits both to individuals, who can enjoy participating in healthier activities, and wider communities as it can often build better relations. Sports, thanks to global cost-cutting capacities in human development can add tremendous positive value to international work' (Adolf Ogi, the UN Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace, 9.3.2005).
2005 is the United Nations International Year of Sport and Physical Education. Sport and physical education are considered to be means to promote education, health, development and peace. One of the goals of the International Year is to create the right conditions for more sport-based development programmes and projects. Several countries, for example Norway, Canada, United Kingdom and the Netherlands, are active in this field. Sport projects apparently can contribute to reaching the MDGs, especially on themes like health, education, gender, environment and peace. They are also known as 'low-cost, high impact' projects.
Is the Council/Commission aware of the fact that the UN stimulates countries and international sports associations to be active in this field through assisting in capacity building, recognising the possible contribution of sport to social cohesion, intercultural dialogues, environmental understanding and re-integration of children in post-conflict situations and the contribution of sport education to economic and social development?
To the Council:
Does the Council share the opinion that sport and physical education can contribute to development and to reaching the MDGs? Is the Council considering promoting sport-based development programmes and projects? Can the Council stimulate a study on the results of projects that have been realised by development organisations and sport organisations on development and sport, the potential of policy in this field and the possible role for the EU and/or the Member States and/or NGOs on development and sport?
To the Commission:
Does the Commission share the opinion that sport and physical education can contribute to development and to reaching the MDGs? Has the Commission experience with programmes on sport and development? Is the Commission considering (other) sport-based development programmes and projects? Can the Commission stimulate a study on the results of projects that have been realised by development-organisations and sport-organisations on development and sport, the potential of policy in this field and the possible role for the EU and/or the Member States and/or NGOs on development and sport? Finally, could the Commission consider an earmarked budget for sport in development projects and programmes?

Agriculture
Better protection from avian flu
2005-11-25 - 12:34
MEPs will debate the Agriculture Committee's call for tough new measures on avian flu control. These measures, which the committee wants to come into force as quickly as possible, introduce compulsory surveillance in the Member States for Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza, which can mutate into the Highly Pathogenic form. The committee also emphasised the need to develop cost-effective vaccines for poultry.
The report by Neil PARISH (EPP-ED, UK), seeks to beef up the measures to be taken by the EU if bird flu hits Europe. Firstly, early warning systems must be improved, say the committee; the authorities must be informed immediately of any outbreak of the virus, even if it is believed to be Low Pathogenic.
Temporary restrictions could be introduced on the transport of birds and eggs in the event of a crisis, pending the findings of epidemiological surveys, says the Agriculture Committee. Poultry and other birds must not be moved to other establishments until it is established that there is no risk they will spread the disease. Eggs can be exempted in order to be transported to a processing plant, as thermal elimination of the virus is regarded as more effective by MEPs in the committee than destruction on the spot. Robust contingency plans should also be drawn up to deal with any outbreak and to ensure proper co-ordination among animal and public health authorities.
The measures to be taken in the event of a crisis in the EU's neighbouring countries should also be tightened up, with restrictions on movements and imports from non-EU countries, the extension of protection zones to the EU's neighbours and the supply of vaccines where these countries are unable to combat a crisis without outside assistance.
For cases of human contamination, MEPs in the committee believe coordinated emergency plans should be envisaged, notably to determine the measures to be put in place in the event of a confirmed risk. These emergency plans would promote coordination between Member States as well as targeting populations needing to be vaccinated as a matter of priority. Anti-virals and vaccines must be as widely available as possible: Member States must create sufficient stockpiles of anti-virals and ensure that they have adequate capacity to produce vaccines against the strain causing the crisis. If a crisis occurs outside the EU, the committee believes the Commission should be able to act within 24 hours by imposing measures such as quarantine, the disinfection of any airports receiving flights from certain regions and travel restrictions.
The Agriculture Committee also recommends closer cooperation with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, based at Solna in Sweden. The role of this agency, which began operations in May 2005, is to help strengthen Europe's defences against infectious diseases such as influenza, SARS and HIV/AIDS.
More funding for veterinary measures
The Parliament will also discuss a second Agriculture Committee report, this time by Ilda FIGUEIREDO (GUE/NGL, PT) on veterinary expenditure. Here the committee stressed the need for equal co-financing rates for outbreaks of both High Pathogenic and Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza. The report calls for a Community-Member State ratio of 50-50 for both types, recognising the need to eradicate the Low Pathogenic form as this can mutate into HPAI. The committee also favoured the idea of the Community paying 100% of the cost of vaccinations.
These two reports have been adopted following the presentation by the European Commission of a proposed directive designed to update measures to be taken in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza. After Parliament's vote on Thursday the ball will be in the court of the Council, which plans to push through the legislation (a priority of the UK Presidency) before the end of the year.

Parliament's Rules of Procedure
New rules for Parliament's approval of Commissioners
2005-11-25 - 12:34
MEPs are to debate plans to improve the hearings of candidate Commissioners to ensure greater fairness between candidates, sharper outcomes and better dialogue between the institutions. The plans are set out in an own-initiative report by Andrew DUFF (ALDE, UK) for the Constitutional Affairs Committee, laying down guidance for EP's committees in conducting and assessing the hearings. The changes are mainly a refinement of existing procedures in the light of last year's experience of running the hearings.

Criminal penalties for infringement of EU law
2005-11-25 - 12:34
Martine Roure (FR) and Maria Berger (AT) for the Socialist group, Kathalijne Buitenweg (NL) for the Greens/EFA Group, and Diana Wallis (UK) and Sarah Ludford (UK) for the ALDE Group will be putting the following oral question to the Commission at the start of a debate on criminal penalties for infringements of EU law: In its judgment of 13 September 2005 in Case C-0176/03, the Court clarified the relationship between policies under the first and third pillars and the primacy of Community law over Union law (Article 47 of the Treaty on European Union) when it also acknowledged that the Community legislature was entitled to require the Member States to impose criminal penalties, where absolutely necessary, in order to ensure that Community rules were fully effective. That would apply in particular where such rules sought to protect fundamental rights such as those relating to a safe environment, as in the case submitted to the Luxembourg Court.
Does the Commission agree that:
- criminal penalties may be applied only in connection with legislative procedures in which the European Parliament is involved under the codecision procedure;
- the definition of such penalties should refer in particular to Community provisions relating to fundamental rights such as the campaign against discrimination and racism, data protection, right of asylum, migration policies, etc.?
Does the Commission agree that, in the light of the Court's judgment, framework decisions based on Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union (third pillar) would have to be reviewed where such decisions constituted a measure which was supplementary to provisions adopted on the basis of Community law?
What measures is the Commission intending to take in order to verify the actual impact that criminal penalties imposed in order to ensure the implementation of Community law will have on both European citizens and the attainment of the objectives of the Union?

European Payment Orders on the way
2005-11-25 - 12:34
MEPs are to debate plans to set up a European Payment Order (EPO) - a new procedure designed to speed up resolution of cross-border payment claims. Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK) will be presenting a first reading report for the Legal Affairs Committee, which backs the Commission's proposal to establish a cheaper and less complex system to recover uncontested debts in other Member States.
The new EPO means the same process for enforcing uncontested debts will operate across Europe. It will, for example, simplify matters for mail order or internet retailers chasing up unpaid bills. At present, individuals and businesses often encounter difficulties and delays when trying to recover debts through unfamiliar legal systems in other Member States, and this can also lead to higher costs. The new simpler, cheaper method should benefit small businesses in particular, and MEPs in the committee are proposing that they should be able to apply the EPO to cases within their own Member State too, if they think it is more convenient. They are also proposing a number of amendments aimed at simplifying the procedure.
The Legal Affairs Committee agreed with the Commission that Member States should be able to introduce the EPO on an optional basis for cross-border payments, alongside their traditional systems. When it comes to purely national cases, MEPs in the committee say it should be up to Member States whether or not introduce the EPO, rather than this option automatically being available, as proposed by the Commission. They also want the Commission to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the new system five year after it enters force.
The EPO would only apply in cases where to payment claims which are not subject to legal controversy in any Member State.

Maritime transport and EU competition rules
2005-11-25 - 12:34
Rodi KRATSA-TSAGAROPOULOU (EPP-ED, EL) will be presenting an own initiative report on behalf of the Transport Committee which is intended to form Parliament's response to a Commission White Paper on the application of EU competition rules to the maritime transport sector. The report, among other points, reminds the Commission the review should aim to preserve, and promote the expansion of, a viable and competitive European shipping sector. It calls upon the Commission carefully to consider the consequences of a possible alternative system on the entire marine transport sector. The committee calls upon the Commission to complete the announced impact study into repealing the block exemption and insists that this qualitative study should address the shortcomings outlined by previous studies in terms of scope and data and not be a mere repetition of what has been published so far. MEPs in the committee say the Commission, should there be any negative impact, should take it into consideration in its new proposal.
The report also emphasises the likelihood of adverse consequences in the event of a general overhaul of the system, not so much for large merchant shipping lines, but rather for small and medium-sized ones and emphasises also that there is no evidence that the abolition of conferences will bring about a fall in prices.

Lower roaming charges for mobile phones?
2005-11-25 - 12:34
Parliament will discuss the high cost of using mobile phones abroad when it considers a report drawn up by Patrizia TOIA (ALDE, IT) for the Industry Committee which calls for a cut in roaming charges. It says information for and protection of consumers is an essential part of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communication. The report insists that consumers are fully and clearly informed on the services offered and the prices charged. In particular, the price structure for roaming charges needs to be transparent. The committee is calling on service providers to reduce roaming charges and says the Commission should develop new initiatives in order to reduce high costs of cross boarder mobile phone traffic, so that a real market for consumers in this area.
MEPs in the committee think that further progress is also needed with regard to number portability for fixed and mobile telephony and charges for call termination on networks. Charges for transferring numbers should be set at a low level or at zero and the time required for transferring numbers should be shortened in some Member States.
Data privacy is another important subject for the committee, which says that that mandatory data-retention obligations would be detrimental to civil liberties and give rise to significant costs for operators. Any introduction of data-retention rules should be by way of codecision with the European Parliament.
MEPs in the committee welcome the voluntary codes to protect users from unsolicited commercial communications.
The reports also deals with the role of the different public bodies involved, from the EU institutions to European and National Regulators. The committee regrets that some Member States have not yet fully transposed the EU regulatory framework or have not applied it properly. They call on the Member States to comply with the principles of transparency and proportionality and to justify the administrative charges imposed on operators for authorisation of services. Emphasis is also placed on the importance of open, transparent and non-discriminatory procedures for the allocation of radio frequencies and the granting of licences.
The committee says it is important to maintain the possibility to give alternative operators access to the new infrastructure on fair and reasonable terms. Obstacles to the full development of the 3 G communications (third generation mobile telephony) must be removed.
Background:
Member States were required to transpose the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications by 24 July 2003 as regards the core directives and by 30 October 2003 as regards the ePrivacy directive. It applied in its entirety from 1 May 2004 for the 10 new Member States. The legal framework covers all satellite based and terrestrial communications networks: public telephony, the internet, cable television, mobile phones and terrestrial broadcasting. The legislation is technology-neutral, placing al transmission networks on a similar footing and giving the EU a regulatory set-up that encourages competition and puts Europe ahead of its major trading partners. The legislation streamlines the rules for market players and makes them consistent throughout the EU, seeking to cut away red tape obstructing entry into national markets. The Commission is required to review the legislative framework and report back to Parliament and Council by July 2006.

Euro
Preparing for a wider euro area
2005-11-25 - 12:34
MEPs are to vote on the legal framework for new Member States wishing to adopt the euro as their currency, possibly as early as 1 January 2007. A report by Dariusz Rosati (PES, PL) for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee proposes changes to the timetable for the cash changeover, but otherwise broadly support's the Commission's plans. MEPs in the committee say the period between adoption of the euro and the introduction of notes and coins should be no more than one year, while agreeing with the Commission that it could be eliminated altogether. They want to limit the period of dual circulation of the old and new notes and coins to no more than two months, with banks changing the old currencies for euro without charge for a further three months. Finally, they call for thorough preparations by the Member States adopting the single currency, notably including sufficiently lengthy periods of dual pricing.
The changes need to become law by the end of 2005 if there is to be sufficient time for country's aiming to adopt the euro in January 2007 to make the necessary preparations. Currently, Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia are aiming at this entry date.

Taxation
VAT in the spotlight
2005-11-25 - 12:34
Parliament is to debate a series of issues relating to VAT, based on two reports by Zsolt László BECSEY (EPP-ED, HU) for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and an oral question from the same committee. The first report deals with the minimum standard rate of VAT in the EU. This is currently fixed at 15 per cent until the end of 2005. The Commission is proposing to extend this minimum rate until the end of 2010. The Economic Committee is recommending that Parliament approve this extension, under the consultation procedure, but the majority of MEPs in the committee voted also to set a maximum rate at 25 per cent. This would have the aim of preventing an further divergence in the standard rates applied by the Member States, thereby avoiding structural imbalances in the EU. (At present, Cyprus and Luxembourg have standard rates of 15 per cent, while Denmark, Hungary and Sweden are at 25 per cent, with the others ranged in between.) The Committee is also asking the Commission to make a general assessment of the macro-economic impact of implicit and standard VAT rates in the Member States, which should also consider allowing all Member States the same opportunity to apply reduced rates on certain goods and services.
The second report deals with the final aspect of the VAT one-stop-shop scheme, which aims to simplify the VAT system in particular for small businesses trading outside their home Member State - the particular issue here being the detailed rules of VAT refunds due to companies from VAT authorities outside their own Member States. Parliament is being consulted on this particular measure some time after the rest of the package because of a change to the legal base. Under the proposed procedure, requests for refunds would continue to be dealt with by the Member State where the VAT was paid, the amount refundable would be determined under the deduction rules of the Member State where the expenses are incurred, and the repayments made directly by that Member State to the requesting taxable person. MEPs in the committee are proposing a few amendments aimed in particular at clarifying the various deadlines within which VAT authorities must respond to applications for refunds.
Since both of the above items come under the consultation procedure, the final decision is up to the Council once Parliament has adopted its opinion.
The oral question, to be put to the Commission by Committee chair Pervenche BERÈS (PES, FR), relates to the lack of progress in the Council of Ministers in agreeing what to do next regarding the experiment introduced in 1999 which allows some Member States to apply reduced rates of VAT to certain labour intensive services. This provision expires at the end of 2005, and was only open to the nine Member States who originally took up the opportunity so none of the new Member States joining in 2004 were able to use it. Ireland has not applied these reduced rates, in the UK jurisdiction they apply only for housing repairs on the Isle of Man. (Follow the link below for the full text of the question.)
