The Russian authorities' decision not to allow the People's Freedom Party to stand in the December 2011 parliamentary elections was condemned in a resolution passed on Thursday. MEPs also urged the Russian government to allow an international long-term election observation mission.
MEPs objected to "cumbersome registration procedures" for political parties in Russia. These procedures do not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights" and show "that there are still real obstacles to political pluralism in the country", they say.
The European Parliament urges the Russian authorities to allow an OSCE/Council of Europe long-term election observation mission in the country and calls on EU foreign policy High Representative Catherine Ashton to get involved in this mission.
