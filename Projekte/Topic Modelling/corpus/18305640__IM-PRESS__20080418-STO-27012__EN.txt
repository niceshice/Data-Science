Slovenia's President Danilo Türk in Strasbourg to address MEPs
In a keynote address to MEPs on Wednesday the president of Slovenia urged the European Union to be creative in dealing with global warming, human rights and immigration policy. The day also saw the House debate the current Visa waiver regime with the US that affects people from 12 European Union countries if they wish to travel to America. MEPs also discussed the situation in Burma calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and more targeted sanctions against the military leadership in Rangoon.
"The EU needs Turkey"
Danilo Türk, the president of Slovenia which currently holds the EU presidency, spoke to MEPs at midday. On human rights he said "the overwhelming concerns with terrorism and other security challenges, coupled with responses to those challenges which are ill-advised or not well thought seem to have reduced the level of sensitivity for human rights. The EU has to fill the gap"
On effective immigrant policy he told MEPs that "persons of immigrant origin who have succeeded should appear on TV and in other media and be seen as examples of success".
On further enlargement of the European Union he said that "no country should be precluded for political inconvenience or cultural prejudice. The EU needs Turkey. The EU should not deprive Turkey of the perspective of membership as this has already been granted. The credibility of the EU is at stake."
Travelling to the US - action on Visas
MEPs had earlier debated visa waivers for EU citizens from 12 EU states travelling to US. A twin-track system was proposed whereby the Commission will negotiate the conditions under Community law on the basis of the mandate received from Council last week and EU states will themselves negotiate other issues on bilateral basis
The majority of MEPs welcomed the mandate for Commission and criticised the fact that some countries decided to open bilateral talks with US.
Burma - smarter sanctions needed
MEPs discussed the situation in Burma after Statements by the Council and Commission. In broad terms the reaction of MEPs called for the release of political prisoner and Aung San Suu Kyi (Sakharov prize laureate). They also demanded the "renewing, broadening and better targeting" of sanctions to hit the junta rather than the Burmese people. MEP also stressed that the EU should exert more pressure on China, India and Russia who provide military goods to Burma and make the EU arms embargo ineffective. A vote on a resolution will be held on Thursday.
WTO, Civil society
MEPs debated WTO reform, preparations for EU-Latin America and Caribbean summit. They voted on reports on the role of civil society in EU drugs policy, China's policy in Africa and the financing of Galileo.
