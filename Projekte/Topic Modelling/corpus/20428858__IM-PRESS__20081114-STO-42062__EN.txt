Monday: MEPs debated equal pay for men and women Monday MEPs discussed ways to narrow the gender pay gap that still exists in Europe, despite 30 years of legislation. MEPs also discussed the future of economic and monetary union as EMU hits 10. Ahead of the plenary in Strasbourg, young students from the EU and its Mediterranean neighbours discussed the conclusions of two days of debates with EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering.
Wage gap still exists
Despite years of legislation to equalise pay, women earn on average 15% less than men and up to 25% less in the private sector, so the women's rights committee is tabling proposals on how to improve things. Slovak EPP-ED member Edit Bauer outlined proposals including the revision of existing legislation, regular pay audits, a special role for equality bodies and appropriate sanctions, but stressed the whole problem can't be solved by legislation alone.
10 years of the euro
MEPs discussed the challenges ahead after 10 years of EMU, particularly in light of the current recession. They also discussed a report on improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance.
"EuroMedScola"- young students meet to discuss Mediterranean issues
Earlier, on Sunday and Monday, the Parliament welcomed around 250 16-18 year olds from the EU and 10 of its Mediterranean neighbours to take part in a two-day seminar. The event was designed to encourage debate and dialogue between youngsters in 2008, the Year of Intercultural Dialogue. The students discussed the environment, equal opportunities and the role of education and training.
Speaking at the closing ceremony Mr Pöttering said, "EuroMedScola is a symbol of hope for the future and Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. It is also proof of its dynamism."
Concluding his speech, Mr Pöttering used the famous words of Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European Community, who said in 1950 about the European project: "We are not bringing together states, we are uniting people".
