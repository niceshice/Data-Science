Simplifying the Common Fisheries Policy

The House adopted an own-initiative report by Philippe MORILLON (ALDE, FR) on the Commission's Action Plan for simplifying and improving the Common Fisheries Policy. The report welcomes the Commission's plans, but calls for more pre-legislative consultation with all parties concerned, as well as a 'standard agreement' to base all fishing agreements on.
Parliament rejects the Commission's idea to submit 'short regulation' on technical measures to the Council, which would bypass the European Parliament in these areas.
