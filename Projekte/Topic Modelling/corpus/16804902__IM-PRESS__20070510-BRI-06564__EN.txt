Briefing - 6-7 June 2007 - Brussels
2007-05-31 - 17:36
Selected highlights of the Brussels plenary session 6-7 June 2007 include:
Wednesday 6 June 2007
The session opens at 3pm on Wednesday, with President Hans-Gert PÖTTERING welcoming the 18 new Bulgarian MEPs whose official mandate starts on the same day.
The first item on the agenda is a key debate on the road-map for the European Union's Constitutional process . Parliament will reject any agreement on a new treaty which does not improve democracy, transparency and citizens' rights, according to the Constitutional Affairs Committee, which is putting forward a report on the EU's constitutional process. It calls on the June European Council to define a roadmap to reach a new agreement on institutional reforms. On Thursday, the House will debate the forthcoming European Council which will focus on the Constitutional Process.
Javier SOLANA , the EU's High Representative for Foreign Policy, will make a statement to the House on the situation in the Middle East . Parliament will debate the latest developments in the region including the heightened tensions in Lebanon, Israel, Palestinian Territories, Iraq and Iran. The vote on a resolution on the Middle East will take place during the next plenary session in Strasbourg in late June (18-21 June).
This is followed by a joint debate on cross-border co-operation with a focus on the Visa Information System (VIS) which includes two reports by Baroness Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK). The Civil Liberties Committee is backing a regulation setting up a database for exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas and visa applications from third country citizens who wish to enter the EU's Schengen area. The text is the result of an agreement with Council so the legislative process should be completed at the first reading stage after the full Parliament votes on the regulation on Thursday.
Parliament then turns its attention to the status of the artist . The employment conditions for performing artists who move around Europe as part of their work should be improved, and they should be better informed on how to transfer their social rights. So says the Culture Committee in an own-initiative report, calling for better protection for artists and the introduction of a special electronic social security card.
The House will also debate reform of the EU fruit and vegetable sector . Parliament's Agriculture Committee believes it is possible to boost the competitiveness of the fruit and vegetables sector by providing flexible forms of aid tailored to the various products and situations in the Member States - and without a significant increase in the EU budget.
In a late addition to the agenda , MEPs will debate (without resolution) European solidarity and the protection of rights of migrants after hearing statements from the Council and Commission.
Thursday 7 June 2007
The session starts at 9.30am with a debate on the preparation of the European Council (21-22June) and situation with regard to the Treaties . MEPs will discuss the preparations for the Brussels summit of with Germany's Foreign Minister , Frank-Walter STEINMEIER , and Minister of State for Europe, Günter GLOSER . The summit is the culmination of Germany's six-month presidency of the EU Council and the main item on the agenda for the heads of state or government of the 27 Member States will be the future of the Constitutional Treaty.
The agenda from the Brussels plenary 6-7 June 2007 can be found here :
On Monday 4 June at 11am, there will be press conference in PHSA050 on the week ahead in the European Parliament.
One day before the plenary gets underway, on Tuesday 5 June, in an extraordinary open Conference of Presidents, MEPs will debate the deteriorating situation in Darfur with The Most Rev. Dr. Desmond TUTU and Jody WILLIAMS who recently headed a UN mission in Darfur. 20070510BRI06564

European Council
Looking ahead to the June summit: focus on the Constitution
2007-05-31 - 17:36
At Parliament's plenary session on 7 June, MEPs will discuss the preparations for the Brussels summit of
21-22 June with Germany's Foreign Minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and Minister of State for Europe, Günter Gloser. The summit is the culmination of Germany's six-month presidency of the EU Council and the main item on the agenda for the heads of state or government of the 27 Member States will be the future of the Constitutional Treaty. The German presidency is due to present EU leaders with a roadmap for resolving this question, which has been in abeyance since the "period of reflection" instituted following the No votes in the French and Dutch referendums in 2005.
No ducking the issue
The constitutional issue has to be resolved because the existing treaties provide for an EU of no more than 27 states. Many argue that without reforms even the current EU will become unmanageable. In addition, under the Nice Treaty, the European Commission must be reduced in size in 2009, so that not every Member State has a Commissioner.
To come into force, the Constitutional Treaty must be ratified by all 27 Member States. So far it has been fully ratified by 16 and nearly ratified by two more. Apart from the two No votes, it is known that the UK, Poland and the Czech Republic believe some arrangement other than the Constitution would be best, for example an amendment to the existing treaties.
The Berlin Declaration adopted in March 2007 called for institutional changes to be in place by the European Parliament elections in mid-2009. The German presidency will therefore put forward a timetable, with suggestions on the substance of the treaty.
Parliament's contribution
The EP overwhelmingly backed the Constitutional Treaty in a report adopted in January 2005. Since the No votes, it has contributed to the "period of reflection" by holding a series of debates on the way forward with prime ministers of the Member States. The most recent of these took place at the last Strasbourg session, with Romano Prodi of Italy and Jan Peter Balkenende of the Netherlands (see links below). MEPs heard very different perspectives from these two leaders, with Mr Prodi calling - if necessary - for a two-speed Europe, while Mr Balkenende stressed the need to take account of the concerns of the anti-constitution voters.
Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee is submitting a report to this week's plenary which will become Parliament's contribution to the European Council. The committee insists that the essence of the Constitutional Treaty be preserved and calls on Member States to coordinate their ratification procedures so as to approve the new text simultaneously by the end of 2008 (see link below).
Ratification: the state of play
The countries which have ratified the Constitutional Treaty are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. In Germany the Treaty has been approved by both houses of parliament but not yet signed by the German president. In Slovakia the parliament has ratified the text but the president has not signed it pending a ruling by the Constitutional Court on a case brought by a group of citizens demanding a referendum. The UK, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Ireland, Portugal and Sweden have not ratified the Treaty.
The Constitution in a nutshell
Key points of the Constitution include more powers for the European Parliament, for example over EU agriculture policy and the budget; boosting the role of national parliaments in EU lawmaking; incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty; more majority voting in Council (national vetoes would be scrapped for asylum and immigration policy but be kept for foreign policy, defence and taxation); an EU president with a two and a half year period of office, instead of the current six-month rotating presidency; and an EU foreign minister (though the minister could only speak on the EU's behalf when the Member States have agreed on a policy).
Other topics on the summit agenda
In addition to the Constitution, the summit will discuss justice and home affairs, including immigration policy, Schengen and new Member States, promoting intercultural dialogue and combating terrorism. It will also look at economic and social policy, including postal services, the European Technology Institute, HIV-AIDS and climate change. Foreign policy issues up for discussion will include the European Neighbourhood Policy and the strategy for Central Asia.

Constitutional Affairs Committee calls for clear roadmap on reforms
2007-05-31 - 17:36
Parliament will reject any agreement on a new treaty which does not improve democracy, transparency and citizens' rights, according to the Constitutional Affairs Committee, which is putting forward a report on the EU's constitutional process. It calls on the June European Council to define a roadmap to reach a new agreement on institutional reforms. The report drafted by Enrique BARÓN CRESPO (PES, ES) and Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE), calls on the June European Council to shortly convene an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) to reach a settlement on institutional reforms - and they ask for Parliament to be fully involved in its work. According to the proposed text, the EP "will reject any outcome of the negotiations which, if compared to the Constitutional Treaty, would lead to a diminution of the protection of the rights of citizens (...) as well as to less democracy, transparency and efficiency in the functioning of the Union". In order to help reach a positive outcome, Parliament will maintain close contacts with national parliaments, as well as with the Committee of Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, throughout the whole IGC.
The committee calls for the preservation of the basic principles of Part I of the Constitutional Treaty in the future agreement on the institutional reforms. The Charter of Fundamental Rights, whose inclusion in the new treaty is still being debated by governments, is one of the reforms the committee deems indispensable. In addition, the report lists the recognition of the Union's values, the clarification of respective competences at national and EU level, the respect of subsidiarity and an increased involvement of citizens in the EU's political life among the crucial achievements of the draft Constitution to be upheld.
MEPs in committee say the outcome of the IGC must take into account all questions raised during the period of reflection on the future of Europe. Particularly, they ask Member States to agree a common approach in the fields of climate change, energy security, migration policy, the fight against terrorism, enlargement, the European social model and the economic governance of the euro-zone.
To facilitate the approval of the new agreement on the institutional reforms, MEPs in the committee also propose to Member States to coordinate their ratification procedures to approve the new text simultaneously by the end of 2008.

External relations
Debate on Middle East with Javier Solana
2007-05-31 - 17:36
Against a background of heightened tension in the Middle East, Javier Solana, High Representative for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), will address MEPs on the situation in the region. Parliament will vote on a resolution on the Middle East at the next plenary session in Strasbourg in late June. President Pöttering in Israel, Palestine and Jordan
European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering made a visit from 27 to 31 May to Israel, the Palestinian Territories and Jordan. In a speech in the Knesset on 30 May he called for a "new start" in the region and suggested a joint conference which would deal with peace and security, with the peaceful co-existence of Israel and a Palestinian state. He restated Parliament's view that "a two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders remains the only way to a satisfactory solution".
Quartet statement
The Middle East Quartet, consisting of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States of America and the Russian Federation, met in Berlin on 30 May for the second time during the German Presidency to discuss the situation in the Middle East.
The Quartet urged a return to the cease-fire: "We all agree that the spiral of violence and
counterviolence has to be stopped", was how the Federal Foreign Minister summed up the discussion to media representatives after the meeting. He went on to say that the message the Quartet wanted to send was that the international community was prepared to support the parties to the conflict in these difficult times.

United Nations Human Rights Council
2007-05-31 - 17:36
The fifth session of the United Nations Human Rights Council will take place from 11-18 June, MEPs will discuss it after hearing statements from the Commission and the Council. At its fourth session, in decision 4/101 of 14 March 2007, the Council decided to convene its fifth session from 11 to 18 June 2007, in order to consider in particular the institution-building process. The United Nations Human Rights Council was set up in March 2006 after the adoption of a Resolution by the UN General Assembly. The resolution established the Human Rights Council, based in Geneva, in replacement of the Commission on Human Rights, as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly. The Council is responsible for promoting universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner.

EU visa information system to help prevent visa shopping
2007-05-31 - 17:36
The Civil Liberties Committee is backing a regulation setting up a database for exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas and visa applications from third country citizens who wish to enter the EU's Schengen area. The text is the result of an agreement with Council so the legislative process should be completed at the first reading stage after the full Parliament votes on the regulation in June. More than a hundred countries' citizens are required to have a visa issued by a Member State to enter the Schengen area. The Visa Information System (VIS) should improve the implementation of a 'common visa policy' in Europe. It aims: to prevent an applicant who is refused a visa by one Schengen country applying to others ("visa shopping"); to facilitate the fight against fraud and checks at external borders; to assist in the identification of those not meeting the conditions for entry, stay or residence in Schengen Member States; to ease the application of Dublin II regulation on asylum; and to help prevent threats to the internal security of Member States.
Information stored
The personal data from visa applications stored in VIS will include biometrics (photographs and fingerprints) and written information such as the name, address and occupation of the applicant, date and place of the application, and any decision taken by the Member State responsible to issue, refuse, annul, revoke or extend the visa. The regulation stresses that biometrics will be used under controlled circumstances, with the emphasis on first using the visa sticker number for verification, in conjunction with fingerprints, and with fallback procedures being put in place. Photographs will not be used for identification purposes as the technology is not yet ready.
Preventing terrorism
The draft regulation states that designated authorities from Member States and Europol may also access data contained in the VIS in specific cases and following a substantiated written request, if this can contribute to the prevention or investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. This access will be indirect, via central access points which will have to check that all the relevant conditions for accessing the data are complied with. In exceptional cases of urgency, these checks can be made afterwards.
Transfer of data to third countries or international organisations may take place only "in an exceptional case of urgency, exclusively for the purposes of the prevention and detection of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences" and with the consent of the Member State who entered the data. Such transfers will be fully recorded and made available to national data protection authorities.
Strong data protection
The regulation contains strong data protection safeguards, something which has been a key goal for Parliament's rapporteur, Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK), in her negotiations with Council.
Access to data by internal security authorities will be always controlled and will happen only under specific and justified circumstances. The Visa Information System database will be managed in the future by a permanent Management Authority - funded from the EU budget - which will gather information from all Schengen countries. Only duly authorised staff of the relevant national visa, border control, immigration, asylum and internal security authorities will have access to the VIS. Such access will take place only if needed for verification at external borders, to examine an application for asylum or for one of the limited number of other purposes set out in the Regulation.
Additional provisions which have been included to ensure adequate data protection and data security standards include the training of specialised staff to deal with data and mandatory scrutiny by national data protection authorities.
Finally, the regulation provides that each visa application file will be stored in the VIS for a maximum of 5 years.
Respect for human dignity
As a result of Parliament's negotiation with Council, an additional paragraph has been added to ensure that any processing of VIS data "will be proportionate to the objectives" and that "human dignity and integrity of the persons whose data is requested are respected". Use of the data cannot lead to discrimination between visa applicants or visa holders on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, MEPs added to the text.
The German presidency committed itself, through two political declarations, also to reach an agreement on two further dossiers linked to the VIS: the Framework decision on data protection and the Directive for the Return of illegal immigrants.
Speaking after the adoption of her report, Baroness Ludford said: "The vote is welcome as the culmination of intense and detailed scrutiny of this highly important European border and internal security project. A sound and balanced first reading agreement has been reached with the German Presidency. The improvements due to MEPs' input are a vindication of the new co-decision powers of the European Parliament in this field."

Personal data "must benefit from an adequate level of protection"
2007-05-31 - 17:36
There is a need for clear rules and regulation, "including penal sanctions, applicable to violations of domestic data protection provisions", which are determined by Member States, according to a report by the Civil Liberties Committee. The report, written by Martine ROURE (PES, FR), sets out a series of amendments to a Council Framework Decision which it states is "merely the first step towards a more comprehensive and consistent framework for the protection of personal data used for security purposes."
National authorities
The report states that for "the appointment in Member States of national supervisory authorities, exercising their functions with complete independence, is an essential component of the protection of personal data", and that at the European level, "a joint supervisory authority should gather the national supervisory authorities and the European Data Protection Supervisor."
Although the national data protection authorities will supervise the manner in which data are processed, the report stresses that the data protection rules laid out in the framework decision should apply to all authorities without exception.
Individuals
Individuals "should, without fail, be informed of the processing of their data", the report states. Concerning the data being processed, the report adds that an individual "shall also be entitled to access and rectify his own data."
The report also states that the processing of data concerning individuals who are not considered a security risk can only take place "if carried out in compliance with the results of an examination performed by a supervisory authority."
The content and accuracy of personal data
There is a need to ensure the quality of the personal data that are held, and the report says that "personal data shall be evaluated taking into account their degree of accuracy or reliability [.]" In addition to this evaluation, the report adds that "data which are inaccurate or incomplete shall be erased or rectified." The report also states that Members States should ensure that data "is verified regularly in order to ensure that the data accessed are accurate and up to date."
Regarding the content of personal data, the reports says that "data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade-union membership and the processing of data concerning health or sex life shall be prohibited."
Such information may only be collected "following prior authorisation by a competent judicial authority", and only if "absolutely necessary for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences."

Prüm Treaty on cross-border data exchange is "a step forward"
2007-05-31 - 17:36
The application of the Prüm Treaty, signed on 27 May 2005, to all Member States, should facilitate the exchange of data to produce "a stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration", according to a report by Fausto CORREIA (PES, PT)for the Civil Liberties Committee. The Prüm Treaty was signed between Belgium, Germany, the Spain, France, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Austria. It is hoped that the treaty will bring about improvements in "making the information available between law enforcement officers in the Member States" which will enable them to fulfil these objectives.
Fundamental rights
Improving methods to combat problems such as terrorism and illegal immigration will involve, to a certain extent, the exchange of personal information. However, the report stresses that the Framework Decision "seeks to ensure full compliance with citizens' fundamental rights to respect for their private life and communications and to the protection of their personal data."
Preventing crime and terrorism
The purpose of exchanging "information in connection with major events with a cross-border dimension", the report says, "is to prevent terrorist offences. The supplying of the data should be "necessary and proportionate" and the information may be exchanged "in so far as is necessary because particular circumstances give reason to believe that the data subjects will commit terrorist offences." However, any exchange of information must be done "in compliance with national law, basic principles of law and fundamental rights [.]"
Information stored in DNA
The collection of cellular material "for a particular individual who is suspected of having committed such a criminal offence", the report states, "shall take place only on the basis of national law and only for a specific purpose and shall meet the requirements of necessity and proportionality."
Special categories of data
The report says that exchange of data concerning "racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, party or trade union membership, sexual orientation or health" should take place "only if absolutely necessary" and "in compliance with specific safeguards."
Time limit on information held
Additionally, the report emphasises that once the information exchanged has been used for its intended purpose, whether these purposes "have been achieved or can no longer be achieved ", then, "the data supplied shall be deleted without delay... and in any event after no more than two years from the date of supply."

Visa information should be obtained only in "clearly defined and monitored circumstances"
2007-05-31 - 17:36
The information obtained from the EU's proposed Visa Information System (VIS) should be limited only to "limited to those who 'have a need to know' and possess appropriate knowledge about data security and data protection rules", according to a series of amendments to the Commission's proposal, presented in a report by the Civil Liberties Committee. The author of the report, Baroness Sarah LUDFORD (ALDE, UK), says that the exchange of such information "may be necessary for the purposes of preventing and combating terrorism and serious crimes", but that any requests for access to the VIS must involve "a verification whether all conditions for access are fulfilled."
Preventing serious crime
The report also states that "it is necessary to designate the competent Member States’ authorities", within which are " duly empowered staff with a right to access the VIS [.]" There should also be "a list of the operating units within the designated authorities" that have access to the information kept on the VIS.
These authorities, the report adds, should "only search data contained in the VIS when they have reasonable grounds to believe that such a search will provide information that will substantially assist them in preventing, detecting or investigating serious crime."
Data protection
The report stresses that "adequate provisions have to be provided for to ensure the necessary data protection", and that such data "shall only be processed for the purposes of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences."
The reports states that "personal data obtained...from the VIS shall not be transferred or made available to a third country or to an international organisation."
It is only in "an exceptional case of urgency [that] such data may be transferred", in which case, "Member States shall ensure that records are kept of such transfers and make them available to national data protection authorities on request."
UK and Ireland's participation
The Commission's proposal states that both Ireland and the United Kingdom are taking part in this Decision, in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis. The Civil Liberties non-binding amendments say that neither the UK or Ireland are taking part and are not bound by it or subject to its application.
As to access to information by UK and Ireland, the Committee' proposed amendment states: "In accordance with Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA, information contained in the VIS can be provided to the United Kingdom and Ireland by the competent authorities of the Member States whose designated authorities have access to the VIS pursuant to this Decision and information held in the national visa registers of the United Kingdom and Ireland can be provided to the competent law enforcement authorities of the other Member States. Any form of direct access for central authorities of the United Kingdom and Ireland to the VIS would, under the present state of their participation in the Schengen acquis, require an Agreement between the Community and those Member States, possibly to be supplemented by other rules specifying the conditions and procedures for such access."

Culture
Better protection for performing artists working outside their home country
2007-05-31 - 17:36
The employment conditions for performing artists who move around Europe as part of their work should be improved, and they should be better informed on how to transfer their social rights. So says the Culture Committee in a report, calling for better protection for artists and the introduction of a special electronic social security card. In the own initiative report on the social security status of artists by Claire GIBAULT (ALDE, FR), adopted unanimously, the committee explains that many artists in Europe, be it singers, musicians or - like the rapporteur herself - conductors, have experienced problems when trying to perform in other countries, or trying to transfer their social rights. International co-productions of live performances, circus or audiovisual productions have been increasing the mobility of many artists, and thus increasing the need for a clearer legal status for the European artists.
Artists should be better informed
MEPs in the committee highlight the fact that in some Member States certain categories of artist do not enjoy legal status. Often, they are not aware of their rights under existing EU legislation. Therefore the committee urges the Commission - in cooperation with the sector - to draw up a practical handbook for European artists, where they can find information about sickness insurance, unemployment benefits and similar issues. The committee also wants the Commission to launch a pilot project introducing a European electronic social security card, specifically intended for European artists.
In order to facilitate the mobility of the artists, the report proposes that the Commission and the Member states introduce a database, in line with the Europass, an initiative launched in 2004 to make it easier to get qualifications recognised in other Member States. This would list the status of the artist as well as his or her previous contracts.
The report also stresses the importance of the teaching of artistic activities and calls on the member states to step up training of arts teachers, and to create specialised training structures for those working in the cultural sector.
Visas for visiting artists from third countries
The committee also raises the problems that third country artists face in terms of visas and work permits, when for instance Russian musicians or Brazilian dancers come to Europe. Therefore, they call on the Commission to reflect on regime applicable to artists and begin to draw up Community rules in this area which could lead to the introduction of a specific temporary visa for European and third country artists, as it already is the case in some Member States.

Budget
European Parliament's budget for 2008 - a budget for the EU tax-payer
2007-05-31 - 17:36
Ville ITÄLÄ (EPP-ED, FI) for the Budgets Committee will be presenting a report on the draft estimates of the European Parliament's revenue and expenditure (2008). The committee recalls that the 2008 budget should be a 'budget for the EU tax-payer', aimed at responsible budgetary behaviour on the part of all actors involved in the process, with decisions on financial resources based on solid reasoning. The committee proposes to set the budget at €1,427,400,000 representing an increase of 2.1% over the 2007 budget which is €64,000,000 lower than the draft estimates set by the Bureau.
The committee considers that until the projects are clearly defined, a precise amount cannot be entered against the corresponding budget lines. This is in particular the case for the new projects proposed by the Bureau such as the research department in the Library or the Museum of Europe and for WebTV. In that context, the committee proposes to leave a token entry (“pm”) in Chapter 10 4 (“reserve for information and communication policy”) and in Chapter 10.6 (“reserve for priority projects under development”)
Information policy
The Budgets Committee takes note of the proposals to allocate an overall budget of €41,800,000 to information policy, which will include €10,300,000 for an awareness campaign in view of the 2009 European elections, €9,000,000 for implementation of the Parliamentary Television Channel (WebTV), €15,700,000 for the Audiovisual Centre and €6,800,000 to complete the construction of the Visitors' Centre.
The committee considers that the development of a specific programme, similar to that for Visitors' groups, which focuses on small and local media would be of interest to Members as one of the most efficient means of raising Union citizens' awareness of the European Parliament's activities. The committee invites the Quaestors to examine the feasibility of providing each Member with proper means for inviting local journalists to come to the European Parliament.
Informatics
The committee notes that the increase in IT expenditure over the last four years has reached 28%; considers that the current strategy was useful in modernising the European Parliament's IT systems, enhancing the services provided to users and developing a new internet website.
The report also notes that the estimate for telecommunications charges is approximately the same as the estimate for 2005, whereas the actual costs have been falling annually since 2004 owing to the use of new technologies and general price reductions in the sector, and in 2006 were €2,100,000 below the estimates. The committee calls on the Secretary-General to report to the Committee on Budgets on the use of current VOIP technologies to reduce telephone costs.
Staff
MEPs in the Budgets Committee consider that efforts can be made to limit the number of staff missions to Strasbourg and, where possible, to make better use of new technologies such as video conferencing.
Finally, the committee is convinced of the need to reinforce the relationship between Members of the European Parliament and Members of EU national parliaments and democratically elected national parliaments of third countries; is willing to support the programme for information exchanges with national parliaments.

Agriculture
Fruit and vegetables: aid tailored to farmers' needs without bigger EU budget
2007-05-31 - 17:36
Parliament's Agriculture Committee believes it is possible to boost the competitiveness of the fruit and vegetables sector by providing flexible forms of aid tailored to the various products and situations in the Member States - and without a significant increase in the EU budget. This is the message of the report by Mabel Salinas (PES, ES) Falling consumption in the EU, rising imports and declining prices as a result of pressure from big distributors are the problems weighing on the European market in fruit and vegetables. The European Commission proposed in January to improve the competitiveness of this sector by giving producer bodies more influence, incorporating the various existing forms of aid into the single payment per hectare system (not linked to production volumes) introduced for other sectors in 2003, safeguarding the environment better and boosting consumption, especially among young people, while still remaining "budget neutral".
By proposing the consultation report by María Isabel SALINAS GARCÍA (PES, ES) with a few proposed amendments, the Agriculture Committee has given its go-ahead to the general thrust of the reform. However, it believes it is possible to provide more flexible aid, better tailored to producers' needs, especially in crisis periods, while meeting the challenge of remaining budget neutral.
Security fund to manage major crises
To enable producer organisations to manage major crises better (e.g. when prices fall), the Agriculture Committee puts forward once again the idea of a Security Fund, which was supported by the EP in an own-initiative report in May 2005. It argues that Member States should set up funds of this kind, to be financed two-thirds by the EU (with a possibility of using up to 0.5% of national reserves) and one-third by producer organisations (POs), which would fund measures for withdrawal from the market, green harvesting etc. These funds would also be open to producers who were not members of POs.
MEPs in the committee are also proposing to set up a body to monitor prices so as to anticipate crises better.
Strengthening producer organisations
To strengthen POs against the power of major distributors and to encourage more producers to join these bodies, the committee is asking for Community co-financing of operational funds to be increased from 50% to 60% in more cases (merging POs, integrated production, etc). It also recommends putting a ceiling on Community aid to these POs of 6% of the value of the production placed on the market.
According to MEPs, the POs should also be able, on a voluntary basis, to finance operations to promote the consumption of fruit and vegetables, e.g. through campaigns in schools.
Flexible support tailored to different producers
MEPs in the committee want more flexibility in the way aid is decoupled from production, with transitional periods to allow the sector time to adapt, especially the processed foods sector (tomatoes, citrus fruits, etc.).

Fisheries
Rebuilding cod stocks in the Baltic Sea
2007-05-31 - 17:36
The Fisheries Committee is proposing amendments to a Commission plan for cod stocks in the Baltic Sea, in a consultation report. Cod is the most important fish species in the Baltic, but its current mortality is between two and three times target levels. MEPs in the committee aim to maintain an appropriate balance between rebuilding stocks and maintaining the conditions for fishing communities to continue their activity. The two cod stocks in the Baltic Sea are suffering from unsustainable levels of exploitation. The Eastern cod stock has declined to levels outside safe biological limits according to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Approximately 35-45% of the cod landed in the Eastern Baltic Sea is caught illegally. The Western cod stock, although in a somewhat better state, is also exposed to very high levels of fishing.
The Commission proposes to lower quotas, reduce fishing effort and increase inspections. They say the package as a whole would gradually reduce the fishing effort by 50 to 75%. The total allowable catches (TACs) for cod in the Eastern Baltic would be reduced by 10% and the TACs in the Western Baltic by 6% compared to last year. If the proposal is not adopted before 30 June, a 15% reduction in the cod TACs will be applied in 2007. There would be a further 10% reduction in days at sea as compared to last year.
In its consultative report, the Fisheries Committee proposes to make the procedure for setting the size of the TACs more flexible, to bring the reduction in fishing days down from 10% to 8% and to increase the notification threshold of cod on board from 100 kg to 300 kg. Furthermore, following the line already agreed by fisheries ministers, MEPs in the committee increased the margin of tolerance in estimating quantities of fish subject to a TAC that are retained on board from 8% to 10% of the logbook figure.
The Fisheries Committee also wants to increase the minimum size of cod caught in the Baltic Sea to 40 cm, to give the fish more time to breed and thereby strengthen the stock.
A recovery plan for the Eastern cod stock
According to MEPs in the committee, it is important to keep the division of the Baltic Sea into a Western and an Eastern zone since "they are separate ecosystems with totally different properties". Therefore the quotas need to be set for each of the two parts. For the Eastern cod stock there should be a recovery plan.
Need to monitor the socio-economic impact of the fishing restrictions
The Commission’s proposal is expected to have far-reaching consequences for both Baltic cod stocks and the fishing industry. "We are talking about cod here – a fish on which many families' livelihoods depend" said the rapporteur Zdzisław Kazimierz CHMIELEWSKI (EPP-ED, PL). The committee approved an amendment requiring the Commission to monitor the socio-economic impact, particularly on employment and the economic situation of fishermen, shipowners and firms engaged in cod fishing and processing, and to report annually to Parliament on these issues from the second year onwards.

Transposition into EU law of control and technical measures adopted by North West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation
2007-05-31 - 17:36
The Fisheries Committee is proposing a report on a proposal which incorporates into Community law, by updating and bringing together in a single regulation, the technical conservation and enforcement measures adopted by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO). Those measures are binding on the EU as a contracting party to the NAFO Convention and should therefore be implemented. Founded in 1978, NAFO is an intergovernmental organisation which provides a framework for regional cooperation intended to promote rational management and the conservation of fisheries resources in the waters of the North-West Atlantic. The Community has been a NAFO contracting party since 1 January 1979.
Member States which operate fishing vessels in the area are Spain (36 vessels), Portugal (12), Estonia (9), Germany (1-5), Latvia and Lithuania (3), Denmark (1-2) and Poland (1).
The rapporteur, Luís CAPOULAS SANTOS (PES, PT), incorporates in the form of amendments any developments subsequent to the drawing up of the Commission text which for reasons of timing do not appear in the proposal, in particular the provisions contained in the most recent regulation on total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas (Regulation 41/2007 of 21 December 2006 fixing for 2007 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required).
The technical measures include provisions relating to minimum fish and mesh sizes, requirements relating to the collection of data and special provisions applicable to shrimp fishing.
The control measures include the establishment of a vessel-tracking satellite system and the requirement for vessels to carry impartial observers.
The supervision and inspection measures include the requirement for the contracting parties to accept a joint scheme for inspection at sea, including infringement procedures which they are required to implement.
The proposal also includes measures intended to ensure that vessels belonging to non-contracting parties which operate in NAFO waters and whose activities are regarded as illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities shall abide by the NAFO rules.
NAFO has 12 members, including the EU, France (representing St Pierre et Miquelon), the Russian Federation, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Canada, Cuba, Denmark (for the Faroe Islands and Greenland), Norway, Iceland, Ukraine and the USA.
