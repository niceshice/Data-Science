Budgets Committee MEPs were first to see Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski's draft budget for next year on Tuesday. Most welcomed a proposed increase in payments, but wanted more for youth programmes, the environment and aid to Palestine.
The 2011 budget theme is " The future beyond the crisis - laying the cornerstone for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth ". The Commission proposes €142.6 billion in commitments (up 2.2% on 2010) and €130.1 billion in payments (up 5.9%). The agriculture and environment heading (N° 2) would stay the same as in 2010, but all others would rise, with the biggest increases going to sustainable growth, i.e. 3.4% in commitments and 14.7% in payments.
No improvement for youth
The planned 5.9% increase in payment appropriations was welcomed by Sidonia Elżbieta Jędrzejewska (EPP, PL), Parliament's rapporteur for the main part of the 2011 budget. However, she contested the Commissioner's view that this would help to "prioritise" the youth of Europe.
"The most important programme for youth is the lifelong learning programme, which finances the Erasmus programme. This is the flagship for me, since it means less well-off students can also afford to go abroad. If I see the planned increase of 2.2% - this does not even cover the inflation rate - it is no improvement at all," said Ms Jędrzejewska.
Cuts for margins
Swedish Socialist Göran Färm wanted more details about proposed cuts to make larger margins in the budget. He criticised the Commissioner's plans to cut support to Palestine by €100 million, to €200 million in 2011. "This is more than the whole margin for heading four (external actions)", he noted. Mr Lewandowski replied that there would probably be amending budgets, adding more money, should it be needed.
Mr Färm also asked whether the Commissioner had found a solution to the problem that the use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund normally is financed from the European Social Fund. Mr Lewandowski assured Mr Färm that €50 million in payments had been budgeted, in order to avoid taking all globalisation adjustment payments from the European Social Fund.
Green wording
German green MEP Helga Trüpel welcomed the wording of the draft budget, but said it was still short on substance.
"I appreciate the green wording - sustainability, smart growth and inclusive growth - but where is the substance? When it comes to fisheries policies, you suggest an increase, but what does it mean to put more money there? Would it really make it more sustainable? And regarding the Life+ programme, your increase sounds very positive, but compared to the challenges we are facing, it is not enough", she said.
"I must admit, I am also not too happy. First of all I do wonder about the general increase of the budget in times like this" said Alexander Alvaro (ALDE, DE), commenting on the increases in commitments (2.2%) and payments (5.9%). The EU institutions should try to make more savings in the draft budget, he added, suggesting, in contrast to Salvador Garriga Polledo (EPP, ES) that funds not used for agriculture should be moved to other parts of the budget. Mr Lewandowski said he was "neutral" about moving unused agricultural funding elsewhere.
"Special spirit of co-operation" needed
Summing up, Mr Lewandowski said that this year's budget procedure would need a "special spirit of cooperation", since the institutions will only have 21 days after the first reading to agree on a final budget.
