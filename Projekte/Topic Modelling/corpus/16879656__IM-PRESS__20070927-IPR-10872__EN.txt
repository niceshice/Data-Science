The European Parliament adopted a written declaration on the need for a comprehensive strategy to control cancer which says "that if cancer is addressed by means of a comprehensive strategy it will soon no longer be the leading cause of death in Europe." The declaration has been signed by more than half of all MEPs, (419 so far) the required number for a declaration to be adopted.
The declaration calls on the Commission to:
- encourage research and innovation in the area of primary prevention and early detection of cancer
- promote relevant information campaigns for the general public and for all healthcare providers
- ensure that Community legislation contains incentives for industry and researchers alike in order to secure ongoing research and guarantee new generations of medicines and new treatments to combat and control cancer
- secure through networks the dissemination of best practices in order to ensure that citizens have access to the best available treatment.
MEPs call on the Council and Commission to formulate a comprehensive strategy addressing the four basic cancer control factors:
a. prevention
b. early detection
c. diagnosis, treatment and follow-up
d. palliative care;
Lastly, the declaration calls on the Commission to review the relevant Community legislation and measures, upgrading and modifying them in keeping with new scientific advances.
