Former Polish Premier Jerzy Buzek became Parliament's first President from Central and Eastern Europe in July 2009. Buzek greets people behind the dais in the Hemicycle Chamber as he opens the session. Monday, 18 January. The President chairs the 12 Parliamentary sessions in Strasbourg each year and those in Brussels. Ushering in a new political era: Buzek welcomes Spanish PM José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero as Spain's EU presidency begins. If MEPs speak over their allotted time his job is to bring down the gavel. Spanish PM Zapatero, President Buzek and EC President Barroso share a joke in Strasbourg on Wednesday. Press room #1: The President arrives for a press conference on the forced departure of the Bulgarian Commissioner. Press room #2: Interpretation for the press is available so nothing is "lost in translation". The last of the first round of hearings of Commissioners-designate and the withdrawal of Bulgaria's candidate provided a buzz at the start of the first plenary session of 2010 in Strasbourg. Other debates included the earthquake in Haiti, Spain's EU Presidency priorities, Iran and re-election of Greek Nikiforos Diamandouros as EU Ombudsman. Here is the Strasbourg week in 10 points.
Earthquake in Haiti: President Buzek opened the January session by expressing sorrow and sympathy for the people of Haiti. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Commissioner-designate Catherine Ashton briefed MEPs on the situation in Haiti and EU commitments for aid. MEPs pleaded for fast aid delivery and long-term reconstruction in one of the world's poorest countries.
Commissioner hearings : Four hearings of commissioners-designate took place in Strasbourg. News of Bulgarian candidate, Rumiana Jeleva's decision to drop out of the running came on Tuesday. "The democratic process is working," Jerzy Buzek said. An hearing for the new Bulgarian candidate is scheduled for 3 February.
Spanish Presidency : "The EU needs to bet on itself," Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero told MEPs. The economic crisis, energy common market and combating climate change were among the main priorities he mentioned for the Spanish presidency of the Council during the first half of 2010.
Situation in Iran: On Tuesday MEPs discussed the situation in Iran. The EU's new foreign affairs chief Lady Ashton said Iran's nuclear programme is in breach of its international obligations. MEPs were concerned about the effect of sanctions for its people and their discontentment about Iran's "use of violence against demonstrators and arbitrary arrests". MEPs also discussed Iraq ahead of parliamentary elections in March, the worrying news on Yemen being a potential training centre for Al-Qaida militants and the human rights situation in Tunisia following the landslide victory of President Ben Ali for a fifth consecutive term.
Copenhagen climate summit: MEPs expressed huge disappointment about the failure of the December Copenhagen climate change summit to reach an ambitious binding deal.
Human trafficking: "Slavery was abolished over 200 years ago in Europe but thousands of people are being sold today," Anna Hedh told us. She said the Swedish model of criminalising the purchase of sexual services could be an EU-wide solution. It's a sensitive issue, but Sweden has fewer problems with trafficking than the rest of the EU, the MEP added.
Ombudsman re-election : Parliament re-elected Greece's Nikiforos Diamandouros as the EU Ombudsman until 2014.
SWIFT: "Irritation," "a kamikaze action," "unacceptable" - how MEPs described the secretive process leading to an interim EU-US agreement on the transfer of SWIFT banking data to combat terrorism.
President Jerzy Buzek: To give you a peep behind the scenes in the EP, our photographer focused on the work of Mr Buzek this week, from the opening of the session with a speech on the dramatic situation Haiti and a meeting with Spanish PM Zapatero.
Twitter-Parliament: 140 characters are more than enough to get a feel for the hearings as political groups and MEPs tweeted their reactions. Also getting in on the action is Mr Buzek who launches his own twitter feed Thursday afternoon.
