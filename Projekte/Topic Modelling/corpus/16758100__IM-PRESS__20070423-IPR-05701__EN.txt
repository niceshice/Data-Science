Earlier this year, the European Parliament called on the EU Presidency to submit a resolution on a universal moratorium on the death penalty to the UN General Assembly. To no effect: to this day, no such text has been tabled. Today, therefore, the Parliament reiterated its request, urging the EU and its Member States to submit a moratorium resolution -- immediately.
In a text adopted by an overwhelming majority of members, the Parliament -- having noted that an earlier (2006) EU statement on the death penalty has by now gathered 88 signatures among UN member countries -- called on the Union to seize the momentum by taking "every possible opportunity" to foster "regional abolitionist coalitions" in the campaign for a universal moratorium.
Lastly, the Parliament called on the EU's institutions, together with the Council of Europe, "to support the World Day against the Death Penalty by declaring 10 October, as from 2007, a European Day against the Death Penalty."
