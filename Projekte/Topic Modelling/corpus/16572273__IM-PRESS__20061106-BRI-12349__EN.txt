Briefing - 13-16 November 2006 - Strasbourg
2006-11-10 - 16:58
The centrepiece of the Strasbourg November plenary is Parliament's second-reading of the Services Directive . Following the Council's decision to follow to a wide extent Parliament's position in first reading, MEPs are likely to approve the common position with little or no change.
Nevertheless, Parliament is expected to receive a written declaration from the Commission to provide answers to what the rapporteur Evelyne GEBHARDT (PES, DE) regards as key questions: the legal scope and nature of the guidelines to be presented by the Commission to the Member States, the possibility of future harmonisation of legislation governing the provision of services, the neutrality of the Services Directive vis-à-vis labour legislation and the influence of the directive on the provision of social services.
Other highlights include formal addresses by the President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia and by the Emir of Qatar - Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani .
The House will also debate the dangers of mercury . The Environment Committee will recommend at first reading that Parliament approve a draft directive outlawing the sale of certain measuring devices containing mercury. However, in its amendments, the committee calls for exemptions for traditional barometers and instruments held in museum collections or put up for sale in the antiques market.
MEPs will also debate and vote on a legislative report on the European Globalisation Fund . The fund will provide up to €500 million each year to help reintegrate into the labour market workers made redundant due to changes in global trade patterns.
Hubert WEBER , the President of the Court of Auditors, the independent EU institution which monitors EU spending, will present the Court's annual report for 2005 on the management of the EU budget to MEPs . This plenary debate comes after the publication of the annual report already presented to the Budgetary Control Committee.
The House will also debate the Commission's work programme for 2007 . The vote will take place in December.
Monday 13 November
The session starts off with the 2006 annual report on the euro area. This is the first report of its kind.
The House will also debate the European Globalisation Fund . The Employment Committee is giving general backing to the Commission's proposal to establish a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The fund will provide up to €500 million each year to help reintegrate into the labour market workers made redundant due to changes in global trade patterns. MEPs in the committee nevertheless propose several amendments, mainly to widen the scope and beneficiaries of the fund and to define eligible action in a more precise way.
Parliament will also debate changes to payment systems under the CAP . The Agriculture Committee, will be recommending that Parliament reject the Commission proposal on laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments, establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers.
Away from the plenary, the Culture and Media Committee will vote on the revision of the Television Without Frontiers Directive .
Tuesday 14 November
Tuesday starts off with Hubert WEBER, the President of the Court of Auditors, the independent EU institution which monitors EU spending, presenting the Court's annual report for 2005 to MEPs on the management of the EU budget. For the twelfth year running, the Budgetary Control Committee heard the Court of Auditors give a negative Statement of Assurance (DAS) for three quarters of Community budget spending in 2005.
MEPs will turn their attention to measuring devices containing mercury . The Environment Committee will recommend at first reading that Parliament approve a draft directive outlawing the sale of certain measuring devices containing mercury. However, MEPs want to introduce exemptions for antique instruments.
John PURVIS (EPP-ED, UK) will be putting forward a report on mortgage credit which reacts to the Commission Green Paper on opening up the mortgage markets. The report says that any EU level action should aim principally at directly improving the situation for the public, notably by widening access to mortgages, for example to people with fixed term contracts.
The House will also debate the issue of gambling and sports betting in the internal market. Arlene McCARTHY (PES, UK), Chair of the Internal Market Committee, will be asking the Commission questions on gambling and sports betting in the internal market. On 12 October, the Commission launched infringement procedures against Austria France Italy, following similar cases in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden.
At midday, and amid heightening tensions in the region, the House will hear from Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in a formal sitting.
Tuesday afternoon is dedicated to debating the Commission's work programme for 2007 with all Commissioners present. MEPs will vote on a resolution on the work programme during the December plenary.
Wednesday 15 November
The key debate of the week takes place on Wednesday morning with MEPs debating the Services Directive . Apart from a few details, the Council text reflects the one adopted by Parliament at first reading. However, the Commission is still expected to give further clarifications.

Services Directive - MEPs to push on with legislation
2006-11-10 - 16:58
The suspense may nearly be over: the European Parliament's final vote on the services directive will take place during the November plenary. Apart from a few details, the Council text reflects the one adopted by Parliament at first reading. By approving the Council's common position, the EP's Internal Market Committee paved the way for adoption of the text by the full Parliament.
Parliament's first reading position largely taken on by Council
The crucial "country of origin principle" has been dropped from the key article. In its place MEPs have put a clause with the title "freedom to provide services". Parliament also voted to limit the scope of the directive. It now covers fewer services than the original text. MEPs expanded the list of reasons allowing Member States to restrict the freedom of a service provider from another Member State to provide services on their territory. The text also now clearly says that the directive does not affect labour law in the Member States.
In the key article of the text adopted by Parliament, devoted to the freedom to provide services, neither the country of origin nor the host country are now specifically mentioned.
The rule of the freedom to provide services replaces the country of origin principle. It requires the Member States to respect the right of the service provider to supply services and to guarantee the provider "free access to and free exercise of a service activity within its territory". This guarantee is underpinned by a ban on a number of obstacles to the free movement of services. For example, in general it will no longer be possible to require a service provider to open an office in the country where he/she is temporarily providing a service nor to prevent him/her from setting up "certain infrastructure" in that country. The provider must not be forced to register with a professional body nor be banned from using his normal equipment at work. In addition, Member States must not apply "contractual arrangements between the provider and the recipient which prevent or restrict service provision by the self-employed".
Thus, on the one hand, the text bans the Member States from erecting obstacles to the free movement of services. But, at the same time, it stipulates grounds which would allow Member States to limit this freedom through national rules. These grounds are public policy, public security, environmental protection and public health.
Member States will also continue to apply their own rules on conditions of employment, including those laid down through collective bargaining agreements. Nevertheless the requirements imposed on cross-border service providers by the Member States using the above justifications must comply with the principles of the Treaty: non-discrimination (for example on grounds of nationality), necessity (public policy, public security or protection of health or the environment) and proportionality (the requirements must be appropriate for achieving the objective).
In certain provisions of the text adopted by Parliament, the reference is made to "overriding reasons relating to the public interest" which allow the Member State to limit, on its territory, the freedom to provide services both by the way of permanent or temporary establishment.
Lastly, the text adopted by the Parliament opens up the prospect of harmonisation of national legislation on the provision of services five years after the directive enters into force.
Services covered by the directive (not exclusive)
The services covered by this Directive concern a wide variety of ever-changing activities, including business services such as management consultancy, certification and testing; facilities management, including office maintenance; advertising; recruitment services; and the services of commercial agents. The services covered are also services provided both to businesses and to consumers, such as legal or fiscal advice; real estate services such as estate agencies; construction, including the services of architects; distributive trades; the organisation of trade fairs; car rental; and travel agencies. Consumer services are also covered, such as those in the field of tourism, including tour guides; leisure services, sports centres and amusement parks; and, to the extent that they are not excluded from the scope of application of the Directive, household support services, such as help for the elderly. Those activities may involve services requiring the proximity of provider and recipient, services requiring travel by the recipient or the provider and services which may be provided at a distance, including via the Internet.
Services not covered
The Directive does not apply to the following activities:
(a) non-economic services of general interest; (b) financial services, such as banking, credit, insurance and re-insurance, occupational or personal pensions, securities, investment funds, payment and investment advice, including the services listed in Annex I to Directive 2006/48/EC; (c) electronic communications services and networks, and associated facilities and services (d) services in the field of transport, including port services, falling within the scope of Title V of the Treaty; (e) services of temporary work agencies; (f) healthcare services whether or not they are provided via healthcare facilities, and regardless of the ways in which they are organised and financed at national level or whether they are public or private; (g) audiovisual services, including cinematographic services, whatever their mode of production, distribution and transmission, and radio broadcasting; (h) gambling activities which involve wagering a stake with pecuniary value in games of chance, including lotteries, gambling in casinos and betting transactions; (i) activities which are connected with the exercise of official authority as set out in Article 45 of the Treaty; (j) social services relating to social housing, childcare and support of families and persons permanently or temporarily in need which are provided by the State, by providers mandated by the State or by charities recognised as such by the State; (k) private security services; (l) services provided by notaries and bailiffs, who are appointed by an official act of government.
The directive does not apply to the field of taxation.
Labour law and social security unaffected
The Council common position says: "This Directive does not affect labour law, that is any legal or contractual provision concerning employment conditions, working conditions, including health and safety at work and the relationship between employers and workers, which Member States apply in accordance with national law which respects Community law. Equally, this Directive does not affect the social security legislation of the Member States."
Second reading by the Parliament
What happened in the Internal Market Committee does not happen every day: all the second-reading amendments to the draft services directive, including those tabled or supported by Evelyne Gebhardt (PES, DE), author of the Internal Market Committee's report, were rejected by the committee. Ms Gebhardt and some members of her political group nevertheless gave their backing to the overall text "as amended", which was thus approved by 26 votes to 4 with 6 abstentions.
This means that the committee finally supported the Council's common position without amending it. Those who voted in favour were seeking to preserve the delicate balance reached between the Member States as well as the compromise drafted by Parliament in February. But for the authors of the rejected amendments, including Evelyne Gebhardt, not everything is done and dusted.
Commission declaration
The European Commission has promised to deliver a written declaration to provide answers to what Ms Gebhardt regards as key questions: the legal scope and the nature of the guidelines to be presented by the Commission to the Member States, the possibility of future harmonisation of legislation governing the provision of services, the neutrality of the services directive vis-à-vis labour legislation and the influence of the directive on the provision of social services. The Commission will also include a reference to the impact of the directive on criminal law, regarded as important by the EPP-ED group and its British shadow rapporteur Malcolm HARBOUR (EPP-ED)
Evelyne Gebhardt heard the details of the Commission's planned declaration at an informal meeting ahead of the vote. While she welcomed it, she reserved the right to retable her amendments in plenary depending on the final text of the declaration, which must be submitted to her before then by Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, Charlie McCREEVY . The Finnish presidency representative, Nina Vaskunlahti , also backed the Commission's draft text but only in her own name. She still has to consult Coreper before the text can be supported by the Council at the plenary.
Entry into force and transposition by Member States
This Directive enters into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. Member States must bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive at the latest three years after the entry into force of this Directive. This would then result in the earliest possible implementation date of December 2009.
It is clear from the current text that there will be at least three major tasks:
Screening, which requires us to review all laws and practices and removing unjustified barriers to trade. Constructing the Point of Single Contact – a website through which service providers can complete all necessary formalities in order to access markets. Preparing for communication and cooperation between Member States, known as Mutual assistance.
Background
The directive on the provision of services in the single market is widely regarded as one the European Union's most important projects of the last ten years.
The European Commission sent the draft directive on services in the internal market to Parliament and the Council on 13 January 2004. This legislation was flagged up as one of the key reforms of the Lisbon strategy. The European treaties of 1957 envisaged the free movement of services as one of the four basic freedoms of the European Community (alongside the free movement of persons, goods and capital). However, this goal has not yet been achieved. The new directive thus aims to remove barriers to the right of service providers to set up shop wherever they wish in the EU and to the free movement of services between the Member States. A report by the Commission published in 2002 lists hundreds of administrative obstacles and disguised or discriminatory protectionist measures.
However, the draft directive has aroused great controversy, even to the point of influencing the results of the French and Dutch referendums on the EU constitution. According to its supporters, the free movement of services within the EU would benefit not only consumers (by giving greater access to a wider range of services) but also service providers (who would have easier access to markets, making small and medium-sized firms in particular more competitive). And there would be a boost to the European economy as the services market is a source of growth and jobs. But others, including some MEPs, Member States and trade union and business representatives, believe these goals could have contradictory effects. They fear, for example, that access to a wider range of services would come at the price of lower standards. They wonder how to protect workers' rights - which differ from one country to another - in an open market in services. Ultimately, they fear the result will be the creation of insecure jobs and "social dumping".

Gambling and sports betting in the internal market
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Arlene MCCARTHY (PES, UK), Chair of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, will be asking the Commission the following questions on gambling and sports betting in the internal market. On 12 October, the Commission launched infringement procedures against Austria, France and Italy, following similar cases in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. The IMCO Committee takes note of the European Commission’s decision of 4 April 2006 to launch infringement procedures concerning restrictions imposed on their sports betting markets which are deemed to be incompatible with article 49 TEC (freedom to provide services).
Furthermore, the IMCO Committee notes the EU Ombudsman's special report issued on 30 May 2006, criticizing the European Commission's handling of a gambling infringement case and emphasizing that the Commission is not entitled to delay in dealing with an infringement complaint on the grounds that it is unable to find a political consensus on how to proceed.
The IMCO committee also recalls the ruling of the European court of Justice in the case C243/01 "Gambelli and others" of November 2003
1) What is the progress on the infringement proceedings launched on 4 April 2006 and what are the next steps planned by the Commission?
2) Does the European Commission intend to restrict the infringement procedures only to the sports betting sector or does it envisage further actions in other gambling-related sectors where discriminatory practices are identified?
3) What initiatives does the Commission prepare to develop a legal framework for on-line gambling that will allow Member States to safeguard consumers and protect minors while allowing legitimate operations by reputable firms? Arlene MCCARTHY PES UK Oral question to the Commission

President of Georgia to address the House
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Amid heightening tensions between Russia and Georgia, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili will address the House in a formal sitting at midday on Tuesday 14 November. Biography
Mikheil Saakashvili became the democratically elected President of Georgia on 25 January 2004.
President Saakashvili was born in Tbilisi, Georgia on 21 December 1967, and is eldest son of three brothers. His mother, Professor Giuli Alasania, is an expert in Georgia's long history of peaceful multi-cultural and religious tolerance and she is still active in education and democracy-building efforts.
In 1984, Mikheil Saakashvili graduated with honours from Tbilisi Secondary School N51 and was accepted into the prestigious Kiev University Institute of International Relations. He graduated with honours. The close friendships formed in his three years in Kiev continue to this day.
President Saakashvili studied in the United States for years. He attended Columbia University in New York City as an Edmund S. Muskie Fellow and received a Master's Degree in Law in 1995. From 1995 to 1996, he studied law at the doctoral level at The George Washington University National Center of Law in Washington, D.C.
In August 1998, he became majority leader of Parliament when his party, "Citizen's Union", elected him leader of their parliamentary delegation. He was re-elected to Parliament in 1999 but this time elected directly by the constituents of the Vake district in central Tbilisi.
The Georgian Parliament elected him head of Georgia's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In January 2000 in Strasbourg, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe elected Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia as its Vice President.
On October 12, 2000, then-President Edward Shevardnadze appointed Mikheil Saakashvili to be Minister of Justice of Georgia. Seven out of eight parties in a deeply divided parliament voted in favour of his appointment.
At the Justice Ministry, Mikheil Saakashvili made it the priority to attack the culture of corruption that pervaded post-Soviet Georgia. He was fearless about starting with the highest levels, and launched tough investigations that quickly produced hard evidence of personal corruption by senior officials.
But, even when faced with the evidence, the government repeatedly refused to prosecute. In one storied moment, Minister Saakashvili brought incriminating photos to a televised meeting of the government, photos that were proof of corruption among his ministers who were at the table. When leaders including President Shevardnadze ignored the evidence, Minister Saakashvili went public and began to release the evidence. Despite threats of reprisal and personal danger, he relentlessly exposed the wrong-doing.
It was also during this period, in the summer of 2001, that journalist Giorgi Sanaya, an outspoken critic of the government, was found shot to death in his Tbilisi apartment. Fifty thousand Georgians marched on the Presidency demanding answers for Sanaya's death, the first large demonstration by Georgians against their government since 1989.
In September 2001, less than a year after his appointment, Mikheil Saakashvili resigned as Minister of Justice over the government's unwillingness to end corruption within itself. He also resigned from his "Citizens' Union Party", also the party of President Edward Shevardnadze.
Only weeks after that resignation and now running as an independent, he was overwhelmingly re-elected to Parliament in October 2001 by the constituents of Tbilisi's Vake District.
Before the end of 2001, he formed a new party, "The United National Movement", pledging to take the fight to the government over corruption. Political contemporaries and citizens flocked to sign up. It was also during this time that the government attempted to shut down independent television station, Rustavi 2, but thousands of Georgians surrounded the station to protect it and the attempt failed.
Mikheil Saakashvili resigned his seat in Parliament to be eligible to run locally for Tbilisi City Council (Sakrebulo). He won on the platform, "Tbilisi without Shevardnadze" and was elected Council Chair.
As Council Chair, 2002-2003, he put new energy into the neglected city and jumpstarted programs to create real city services. Pensions were increased, streets were paved, playgrounds were built and corrupt city officials found out: The party was over. He ended the widespread practice of illegal construction that fed itself on payoffs to corrupt city officials.
He established the "Heroes Memorial" on Heroes Square in Tbilisi to honour all those who died protecting the territorial integrity of Georgia. He also created the first memorial in the country honouring the 18 Georgians who died on the steps of Parliament, bludgeoned to death with shovels by uniformed Soviet troops on 9 April 1989 during what had been a peaceful demonstration for Georgian independence from the Soviet Union.
He became a candidate again for Parliament for the new "National Movement" party in what would become the historic Georgian national elections scheduled for November 2003. He ran on the platform, "Georgia without Shevardnadze".
When the government released election results placing President Shevardnadze's coalition, named "For New Georgia", first in the vote with Saakashvili's "National Movement" at number two, there was instant public outrage. Every international observer and scientific pollster had documented that "For New Georgia" went into the election with single digit public support and could not have come out with the numbers it claimed.
Mikheil Saakashvili and the late Zurab Zhvania, a Member of Parliament from the "United Democrats" party, united to reject the election results and called on the public to protest and to protest in public. Thus began the Rose Revolution.
Saakashvili was determined that the protests would be determinedly non-violent, lawful and constitutional. With Zhvania and the Speaker of Parliament, Nino Burjanadze, they strategized to plan peaceful demonstrations by the Georgians pouring into the streets.
For 19 days and nights, with the crowds growing larger every day, Saakashvili led the public rejection of the contrived election results. Whether roaring in unison under windows where ministers retreated in offices, or honking countless car horns in ear-splitting din at coordinated signals, the protests grew louder, larger and more intense. Mikheil Saakashvili left Tbilisi to tour the regions of Georgia and lead countless thousands more Georgians back into Tbilisi to join the throngs. Through those weeks, non-violence was the leadership's method and means and the people of Georgia were faithful to it.
Critical mass occurred on 22 November 2003 when President Shevardnadze and his allies gathered for the opening of Parliament for a session that would certify the fraudulent election results. At first there was no quorum as parliamentarians boycotted the session. Even the Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Ilia II, declined to attend the session to deliver his traditional blessing on opening day.
The session of Parliament had to be stopped to prevent constitutionally legitimate approval of the illegal election reports. Trying to bring the government to a halt, Mikheil Saakashvili and followers peacefully entered and occupied government offices of the Chancellery. That's where they were when they received word that Parliament had achieved a quorum: Parliamentarians of the "New Right" party reversed their earlier decision to boycott and had entered the Parliament to join President Shevardnadze and his allies.
It was Mikheil Saakashvili who made the historic decision that the protestors should enter the Parliament itself to stop the session. He led a selected group, including Zhvania and Burjanadze, through the throngs to the doors of the Parliament. He lifted his hands to show he was unarmed. In one hand, he held a red rose.
He pushed into the building, but was forcefully ejected and the furious crowds pushed their way at the building, lifting their roses. However, what could have turned violent, did not. The Georgian guards surrounding Parliament had become familiar with the protestors over the weeks, chatting with their fellow Georgians for days and nights; the protestors had even fed the young guards when the government had made no such provision. At the moment the crowds began to surge, the guards first resisted, but then, they began to disobey their shouting superiors. The young Georgian security guards stepped aside and led by Saakashvili, the people of Georgia entered their Parliament.
Most members of Parliament fled, fearing the crowd. President Shevardnadze was whisked out the back, physically carried aloft by his guards. Upon his desertion of the Parliamentary session, Speaker Burjanadze was declared acting President.
Mikheil Saakashvili and his fellow leaders went to the President's residence. After long hours of negotiations deep into the night, President Shevardnadze resigned in the early hours of 23 November 2003. In the special elections held on 4 January 2004 that were watched by the entire world, the people of Georgia overwhelmingly elected Mikheil Saakashvili as their President. President Saakashvili lives in a 3-room apartment in a private residential building in Tbilisi with his wife, Sandra, and their two sons.

Situation in Gaza
2006-11-10 - 16:58
On Wednesday at 3pm, MEPs will debate the situation in Gaza after hearing statements from the Commission and Council. MEPs will also vote on a resolution. On 8 November, 2006, the EU Presidency made the following statement on deaths of civilians in Israeli operation in Gaza. "The Presidency is appalled at the continuing killing of civilians due to the ongoing Israeli operation in Gaza. The Presidency calls on Israel to end its military action in Gaza and on the Palestinians to stop firing rockets onto the Israeli side. The spiral of violence will only have serious consequences for the security and political situation in the region.
The Presidency appeals for calm and restraint on both sides. The Presidency also urges the Palestinians to continue their efforts to form a government of national unity."

Baltic Sea Strategy for the Northern Dimension
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Alexander STUBB (EPP-ED, FI) for the Foreign Affairs Committee will be putting forward an own-initiative report on a Baltic Sea strategy for the Northern Dimension. The committee aspires, by means of this resolution, to make the most of the opportunities offered by the dynamic economies of the Baltic Sea region and systematically create a brand for the region as one of the most attractive and competitive areas in the world- The committee wants to help to improve the ecological status of the Baltic Sea, which is currently one of the most polluted sea areas in the world; reduce pollution andeutrophication and prevent further releases of oil and other toxic and harmful substances.
The report stresses the need to reduce the region's dependency on Russian energy and encourages the Member States in the region to examine the possibility of a common energy market. The Foreign Affairs Committee calls on the Commission, the Member States and the partners to promote joint projects on energy efficiency and renewable energy resources, in the light of the region's potential as a source of bio-energy, and to encourage the usage of biomass, solar, wind and hydro energy and support the work of the Baltic Sea Region Energy Co-operation.
The report also. suggests that the Trans-European Network Nordic Triangle be enlarged to cover the whole region and inclusion of the road and railway routes of the Barents Corridor and the Bothnian Corridor within the TEN system. The committee calls for the realisation of the Rail Baltica project which would mean a high-speed train connection linking up the whole region. The committee calls for the realisation of the Via Baltica highway by 2013 as a priority project linking the Baltic Sea region with Member States in central and western Europe and stresses the importance of European funding for the realisation of the project.
Kaliningrad
The committee notes the status of the Kaliningrad Oblast enclave surrounded by the European Union and calls for genuine cooperation between the regional authorities, the Russian Federation and the European Union. The report urges the Russian Federation and the European Union to examine the possibility of developing the Kaliningrad Oblast into a more open and less militarised pilot region with improved access to the internal market. The committee stresses the need for full implementation of freedom of navigation in the Baltic Sea, including the Vistula Lagoon and Kaliningradzkij Zaliv, and free passage through the Pilava Strait/Baltijskij Proliv.
The report points out that the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Wellbeing (NDPHS) should become more practical in combating major diseases as well as enhancing and promoting health and socially rewarding lifestyles. The committee calls on the Russian Federation and the EU to examine the possibilities of practically engaging the Kaliningrad Oblast in NDPHS activities.
The committee stresses that the Kaliningrad Oblast is still an enclave plagued with many social, economic and ecological problems, such as the significant ecological risk posed by the presence of the military bases and weapons in the region, the substantial health risk and the high levels of organised crime and drug addiction.
Eastern border
MEPs in the committee are concerned that the region's Eastern border is serving as a conduit for a significant level of organised crime, with trafficking in humans and drugs giving cause for particular concern. The committee urges a strengthened Europol involvement and reinforced cooperation at both EU and intergovernmental levels on these issues. Parliament stresses the need to redouble efforts to improve the efficiency of border controls on the Eastern border, in particular as regards upgrading the existing infrastructure and promoting legal border crossing, and calls for sufficient funds to be earmarked from the European External Borders Fund.

Mercury thermometers soon to be museum pieces?
2006-11-10 - 16:58
The Environment Committee will recommend at first reading that Parliament approve a draft directive outlawing the sale of certain measuring devices containing mercury. However, MEPs want to introduce exemptions for antique instruments. The directive would ban the sale of certain new non-electrical measuring devices containing mercury, as this metal poses a serious risk to health. Medical thermometers, barometers, manometers and sphygmomanometers (used for measuring blood pressure) would be affected by the ban.
The committee broadly backs the directive, and the author of its report, María SORNOSA MARTÍNEZ (PES, ES) is keen to see the legislation approved at first reading so it can enter into force and reduce industrial demand for mercury as quickly as possible.
However, in its amendments the committee calls for exemptions for traditional barometers and instruments held in museum collections or put up for sale on the antiques market . The amendment from the committee reads: "by way of derogation - (a) antique barometers and scientific instruments intended for sale or trade in the international antiques market; (b) the production of traditional barometers using small quantities of mercury in carefully controlled and licensed environments."
" Exemptions may be authorised in cases where alternative solutions are not yet available, as well as in the rare case of the maintenance of traditional barometers, museum collections and industrial heritage. "
The committee also asks the Commission to take short-term measures to ensure that all products containing mercury and currently circulating in society are collected separately and treated safely.
Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems and wildlife. Around 80-90% of all mercury used in measuring and control devices is used in medical (fever) thermometers and other thermometers for household use. Although use of mercury is declining, some 33 tonnes are used for measuring and control devices per year in the EU.
Mercury can change in the environment into methylmercury, which is its most toxic form. Methylmercury collects and concentrates in the aquatic food chain, making populations with a high intake of fish and seafood particularly vulnerable (e.g. in coastal areas of the Mediterranean). Direct exposure to mercury via the inhalation of vapour and absorption through the skin is also a health risk.

Framework for Community Action in the field of Marine Environmental Policy
2006-11-10 - 16:58
As part of a joint debate on marine strategy, Marie-Noëlle LIENEMANN (PES, FR) for the Environment Committee will be tabling legislative report on Framework for Community Action in the field of Marine Environmental Policy. The aim of the draft directive is to secure an ecologically sound marine environment is a key feature of EU environmental policy. Indeed, the EU’s 6th Environmental Framework Programme devotes a single Thematic Strategy to the protection and conservation of the marine environment. The European Council has stated its wish to see the outlines of an ambitious Marine Strategy in the course of 2005. In presenting this proposal, the Commission is fulfilling its obligation to establish just such a strategy.
The committee says the directive should:
(a) protect and preserve the marine environment or allow recovery of it or, where practicable, restore the function, processes and structure of marine biodiversity and marine ecosystems;
(b) prevent and phase out pollution in the marine environment so as to ensure that there are no significant impacts on or risks to marine biodiversity, marine ecosystems, human health or legitimate uses of the sea;
(c) limit activities in the marine environment to levels that are sustainable and that do not compromise uses and activities of future generations nor the capacity of marine ecosystems to respond to natural and human-induced changes.
This Directive is applicable to all European marine waters and, says the Environment Committee, take account of the need to ensure the quality of the marine environment of associated and applicant States. The committee also says that the following geographic marine areas should be covered:
(a) the Baltic Sea;
(b) the North East Atlantic Ocean;
(c) the Mediterranean Sea. and
(ca) the Black Sea. Rapporteur Marie-Noëlle LIENEMANN PES FR A6-0373/2006 Community action in the field of marine environmental policy Procedure : Codecision (1st reading)

Thematic strategy for the marine environment
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Aldis KUŠĶIS (EPP-ED, LV) for the Environment Committee will be tabling an own-initiative report on a thematic strategy for the marine environment. The committee calls for the inclusion in the Directive on the marine environment, a common EU-wide definition of good environmental status (GES), understood as the environmental status when all the marine ecosystems within a given Marine Region are managed in ways which allow them to function in a balanced, self-sustaining way in the face of environmental change, supporting both biodiversity and human activities. This provides for greater effectiveness in the implementation of the Marine Strategy Directive.
Synergies with EU policies
The Environment Committee welcomes the Green Paper "Towards a future Maritime Policy for the Union" which foresees a holistic approach to the sustainable development of the oceans, but warns against too great an emphasis on an economic approach and urges that a balance be struck between the economic and ecological angles. The committee expects the Marine Strategy Directive, its environmental pillar, to provide the legal framework for the preservation and integrity of the marine environment and thus the legal framework for the appropriate management units - the Marine Regions and Strategies - for marine planning and decisions.
Budgetary concerns
The committee expresses its concern over the lack of financial commitment for the implementation of the Marine Strategies. The report asks the Commission and the Member States to identify the measures that could be co-financed through Life+ due to their particular importance for the achievement of GES in the European marine waters.
In order to avoid a double bureaucratic burden on the effective delivery of the Marine Strategy Directive, MEPs in the committee ask the Commission and Member States to ensure either that the regional marine conventions have the relevant legal and administrative capacities or that mechanisms for joint implementation of the Strategy are developed between the different regional bodies operating within the same marine region. In either case this must include the widest possible cross-sectoral and stakeholder involvement.
The committee calls on the Commission to study the possibility of making the Baltic Sea into a pilot area, in view of the fact that it is an especially sensitive sea area and the Member States surrounding it are likely to agree on faster implementation of the plans and actions through the work within HELCOM and other bodies. The committee notes that the forthcoming Baltic Sea Action Plan from the Helsinki Convention (HELCOM) could act as a pilot programme to implement the Strategy objectives in the Baltic Sea Marine Region.
The own-initiative report recommends the inclusion of the Black Sea as one of the Marine Regions to be covered by the Marine Strategy Directive; this important marine region is bordered by Bulgaria and Romania, countries that will join the EU in 2007 and are already participating in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive - as part of the work led by the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River -, and by Turkey, with whom accession negotiations are underway.

Access to information and justice in environmental matters
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Eija-Riitta KORHOLA (EPP-ED, FI) for the Environment Committee will be tabling a non-binding report on a new agreement on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters. The committee recommends the adoption of the proposed agreement, as it is in line with the spirit of the Aarhus Convention, is consistent with the relevant EC law, and in the Second Meeting of the Parties, there were no difficulties in adopting the amendment proposal. It makes the provisions for public participation in decision-making on GMOs clearer, emphasizes the importance of transparency in decision-making procedures, and provides access to the relevant information. The amendment is also important, especially for those countries that are parties to the Convention, but who lacked national legislation on the topic. It is therefore proposed that this amendment to the Aarhus Convention is approved, and the Council Decision adopted.
The UN/ECE convention on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters (the Aarhus Convention), was signed by the Community, and its Member States, on 25 June 1998. The Convention entered into force on 30 October 2001, and was approved by the Community on 17 February 2005. The Convention aims at granting the public rights, and imposes on the Parties and public authorities, obligations on these three key areas, that are the pillars on which the Convention is formed.
At the first meeting of the Parties in October 2002, signatories to the Convention requested the further development of the application of the Convention, to cover the deliberate release of GMOs. The first Meeting of the Parties subsequently established a Working Group on GMOs, with a mandate to identify and develop potential options to strengthen the existing Aarhus provision on the topic.
The Second Meeting of the Parties, in May 2005, agreed on an amendment to the Aarhus convention. It especially aims at making the obligations placed on the parties more specific, with regard to public participation in the GMO decision-making process. A decision to amend the convention was, in fact, timely and pressing, due to the delicate nature of the issue and the lack of national legislation in some signatory countries. In the meeting, a compromise text was presented, deleting the original paragraph on GMOs in the Convention, and replacing it with the insertion of a new article and a new Annex on GMOs.
The amendment aims at being consistent with the existing Community legislation, namely Directive 2001/18/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, which incorporate provisions for public participation in decision-making on GMOs. This was the key priority for the European Community. The amendments to the Convention should not give rise to the need to amend the existing EU legislation but to address more, for instance, the concerns of the Central Asian and Eastern European countries.

Budgetary control
Community budget spending still prone to irregularities
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Hubert WEBER, President of the Court of Auditors, the independent EU institution which monitors EU spending, will present the Court's annual report for 2005 on the management of the EU budget to MEPs. This plenary debate comes after the publication of the annual report already presented to the Budgetary Control Committee. The report will inform Parliament's work in deciding whether to grant discharge to the various EU institutions for their budgetary management in the year in question.
For the twelfth year running, the Budgetary Control Committee heard the Court of Auditors give a negative Statement of Assurance (DAS) for three quarters of Community budget spending in 2005. MEPs responded by saying that the start of the budget discharge procedure already has "an air of déjà-vu".
Hubert Weber, President of the Court of Auditors, said in his statement to the committee that, thanks to control and surveillance systems, the risks were managed satisfactorily in 2005 for a number of areas: revenue, administrative expenditure and the pre-accession strategy, except the Sapard programme. The court was unable to give a positive DAS for other areas, namely the common agricultural policy (for expenditure not subject to the Integrated Administration and Control System, structural measures, internal policies and external action.
The court notes that payments are still prone to significant errors and that the Commission, the Member States and the beneficiary countries must step up their efforts to implement effective control and management systems.
The court also notes that bodies responsible for implementation in the countries of the 2004 enlargement and the candidate countries are still open to significant risks.
According to Salvador GARRIGA POLLEDO (EPP-ED, ES), the MEP who will draft Parliament's budget discharge report on the 2005 financial year, "the regulatory complexities" are a major problem. He therefore calls for payment procedures under the Community budget to be simplified, and for this to be part of the forthcoming negotiations on revision of the EU's Financial Regulation.
The general rapporteur on the 2007 budget, James ELLES (EPP-ED, UK), was surprised to find no trace of the idea supported by Parliament of having "national declarations" to establish a level of responsibility for expenditure jointly managed by the Commission and the Member States. Overall, however, MEPs in the committee displayed a noticeable scepticism: the broad impression of déjà-vu (voiced by Bart Staes, Greens/EFA, BE) among others, was accompanied by a note of realism regarding the lack of progress on the categories of expenditure for which the court cannot certify the legality of transactions.
Lastly, MEPs in the committee are unhappy that they had received the report at the last minute, whereas the Commission was already fully aware of its contents. Debate : 14.11.2006 Court of Auditors Annual report (2005)

Employment policy
European Globalisation Fund supported but scope broadened
2006-11-10 - 16:58
The Employment Committee is giving general backing to the Commission's proposal to establish a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The fund will provide up to €500 million each year to help reintegrate into the labour market workers made redundant due to changes in global trade patterns. MEPs in the committee nevertheless propose several amendments, mainly to widen the scope and beneficiaries of the fund and to define eligible action in a more precise way. In the report by Roselyne BACHELOT-NARQUIN (EPP-ED, FR) the committee stresses that, notwithstanding the positive effects of globalisation on growth and jobs, it can also have negative consequences for the most vulnerable and least qualified workers in some sectors. Assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should therefore provide solidarity and support for individual workers made redundant as a result of structural changes in world trade patterns. It should not finance the restructuring of companies or sectors - only active labour market measures shall be supported and not passive social protection measures, says the committee. The EGF should also have the aim of stimulating economic growth and creating more jobs in the European Union.
Who is eligible for funding from the EGF?
MEPs in the committee want to guarantee that more workers can be supported via the EGF. In general they agree with the Commission that assistance should be concentrated on workers made redundant in those areas most adversely affected by economic dislocation due to changes in world trade patterns, but they want to broaden the intervention criteria. An intervention should, they decided, not only be possible if the result of the economic disruption is that 1,000 workers lose their job in an company, but also, in small labour markets or in exceptional circumstances, when at least 500 workers are concerned and a there is a serious impact on the employment and the local economy, or when during a period of 12 months at least 1,000 workers lose their jobs in one or more companies in a particular region.
Where does the money come from?
No specific financial provision for the EGF has been made in the EU's financial framework for 2007-2013. The Commission proposal says a maximum amount of €500 million per year will be financed through funds that have been under-spent against the other budget ceilings. The Committee set out some detail on how this should operate.
When will the EGF be up and running?
The EGF can start as soon as the new regulation enters into force, at the end of the present codecision procedure. The Finnish Presidency would like to adopt a Common position on 1st December. Informal negotiations are going on between the rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs and the Council with the aim of finding an agreement in first reading to make the fund operational as soon as possible.

Employment policy
Social security and free movement of people
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Maria MATSOUKA (PES, UK) will be tabling a legislative report on the annual update of social security rules for employed persons moving within the Community. Since 1971 Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71(1) provided the foundations for granting social security benefits to citizens moving from one Member State to another. Every year essentially Regulation No 1408/71 and its implementing Regulation ( (EEC) No 547/72(2)) are amended in order to take into account developments in national social security schemes, to incorporate the changes which have taken place in national legislation and also to accommodate the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The regulation plays an important role in implementing one of the four fundamental freedoms of the European Union, namely freedom of movement of citizens. Freedom to live, work and move freely within the European Union - with the dismantling of economic and administrative barriers as far as possible - constitutes a tangible advantage which the EU provides to its citizens.
In short, the regulation continues to determine whether citizens retain the right to enjoy the special benefits provided by their Member State of origin - if so they may therefore be exported - or whether a corresponding benefit is available in the new Member State of residence of the party concerned.
The committee recalls that the Commission proposes that Regulation 1407/71 be updated, taking into account the amendments to national social security legislation, particularly in the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden. It also seeks to present technical amendments and improvements to the regulation. In other words, this is a technical and transitional Regulation given that the new Regulation 883/2004 and its provisions are about to be implemented.
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee welcomes the proposed amendments which seek to facilitate the coordination of social security scheme. The committee has tabled a number of amendments, also of a technical nature, aimed at simplifying the proposal, correcting errors and omissions and updating the annexes to Regulation 1408/71.

Agriculture
Reform of direct payments under the CAP - proposal to be rejected?
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Lutz GOEPEL (EPP-ED, DE), for the Agriculture Committee, will be recommending that Parliament reject the Commission proposal on laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments, establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers. The Commission proposal on the introduction of voluntary modulation goes back to a Council decision of December 2005. The background was the cuts in rural development funding which were agreed in the Council at the insistence of the 1% States, particularly Britain (around €69bn instead of €88bn), which were to be partially compensated by voluntary modulation. Parliament had immediately expressed strong reservations about this (see Declaration 9 on the Interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (IIA)).
The Council decision also provides for the EU's total expenditure, including that on agricultural policy, to be subjected to a 'health check'. The European Parliament is to participate fully in the preparation and implementation of the results (cf. Declaration 3 on the IIA).
The Commission proposal, which partially deviates from the Council decision, contains the following essential elements:
- Member States may cut up to 20% of all direct payments under voluntary modulation (the Council also wished to include market expenditure).
- Modulation is not subject to any conditions, except that small recipients (i.e. those receiving less than € 5000 in direct payments) are exempt from it.
- The funds may be used freely in accordance with the provisions of the EAFRD Regulation; the rules on minimum expenditure per axis must be complied with (this was not what the Council advocated).
- Co-financing is not compulsory.
- Member States must decide the rate of reduction for the whole financing period within two months.
No impact assessment has been performed.
Member States are strongly in favour of a further increase in flexibility, i.e. in particular the abandonment of the earmarking of funds for particular axes, an extension of the declaration period, the possibility of adjusting modulation rates during the financing period, greater regionalisation, etc.
Assessment
The committee cannot agree to the proposal because:
- it jeopardises the survival of many farms,
- it distorts competition and discriminates against farmers in individual Member States in a way which violates the Treaty,
- it entails the abandonment or renationalisation of the CAP and abandons the principle of solidarity enshrined in the CAP,
- it disregards Community objectives in rural areas,
- it is unbalanced and incoherent, and
- it violates the EP's rights of participation.
In the absence of an impact assessment or reliable figures, Parliament cannot consent to such a far-reaching paradigm shift.
The rapporteur observes that, in the Reimer BÖGE (EPP-ED, DE) report, Parliament proposed that the financing problems of the CAP be solved by means of compulsory national co-financing of first-pillar expenditure. That would have made it possible to honour the pledges which the Heads of State and Government gave to farmers in October 2002 without calling into question the common agricultural policy, i.e. a policy decided jointly at European level.
The Council decision restricts the debate on the structure of agricultural expenditure in connection with the health check to modulation issues, as the statement by the Commissioner on the expansion of compulsory modulation after 2008 shows. There will evidently not be any sincere consideration of the proposals made by Parliament in the Böge report.
Individual retrospective improvements are not sufficient: rather, a comprehensive examination of all possible alternatives is needed, on the basis of which coherent and consistent measures could then be worked out.

Milk quotas - is phasing out an option?
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Duarte Freitas, Carmen Fraga Estévez, Salvador Garriga Polledo, Esther Herranz García, Elisabeth Jeggle, Albert Maat, Mairead McGuinness, Francisco Millán Mon, James Nicholson, Neil Parish and Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the EPP-ED Group, will be asking the Commission the following questions on milk quotas: The European Commission intends to undertake a ‘health check’ of the CAP in 2008, which is likely to include a debate on the future of milk quotas. The existing regime of milk quotas, which has been in force since 1984 and is set to continue until 2015, has been questioned from certain quarters and was discussed at the informal meeting of the agriculture ministers in Oulu.
In view of these signs of a possible progressive dismantling of the quota system (phasing-out), it seems necessary now to have a proper debate so that producers and the industry have time to adapt to possible future changes.
Does the European Commission intend to maintain the system of milk quotas until 2015, which offers a certain protection for many producers, or does it intend to dismantle the quota system progressively or gradually from 2008 onwards? If phasing out is intended, what specific measures might be involved for milk producers? Oral question to the Commission
Debate : 13.11.2006 Commission press release - 3 October 2006 - Member States face levies of € 377 million for exceeding milk quotas

Agriculture
Support for rural development
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Jan MULDER (ALDE, NL), for the Agriculture Committee, will be putting forward a non-binding report on support for rural development recommending that Parliament's approves the Commission proposal. EAFRD - December 2005 Financing Agreement
All rural development payments from 2007 - 2013 will be made out of the EAFRD (European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) – the single fund which will replace the two current sources of rural development funding (the EAGGF Guarantee and Guidance funds).
The December 2005 European Council financing agreement did agree certain parameters for the overall Rural Development fund of €69.75 billion before modulation. At least €33.01 billion will be shared between the ten New Member States, plus Romania and Bulgaria, which are expected to join the EU on 1 January 2007. The remaining €36.74 billion will be divided up among the EU-25, with at least half (€18.91 billion) being guaranteed for the EU-15.
Within this total, some €4.07 billion will be allocated to national envelopes for certain countries - i.e. €1.35 billion to Austria, €460m to Finland, €500m to Ireland, 500m to Italy, €20m to Luxembourg, €111m to France, €820m to Sweden and €320m to Portugal. In Portugal’s case, the Council concluded that the money should not be subject to co-financing, making reference to the particular constraints that Portuguese agriculture faces, as described in Commission's report 10859/03.
The total amounts for rural development have been agreed on a considerably lower level compared to the initial Commission proposal for the Financial Perspectives.
European Commission's Proposal
The European Commission's proposal COM (2006) 237 proposes, in line with the December 2005 Financial Council Agreement, to exempt Portugal from the application of the co-financing requirement for the amount of EUR 320 million.
Commission proposal COM (2006) 237, amending Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, is necessary in order to bring the "capping provision" in line with the December 2005 European Council Agreement as well as with the relevant provision in the Community legislation governing the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2007–2013.
Capping means the maximum total spending of all structural and rural development funds in a particular Member State, as a percentage of its GDP. As the total amount of funds at a European level has been agreed by the Council on a much lower level, as compared to the initial Commission proposal, the capping provisions in the corresponding legislation have to be altered accordingly.
The committee proposes to exceptionally accept the proposal to exempt Portugal from the application of the co-financing requirement for the amount of EUR 320 million assuming that this concerns a once-off operation. The proposed changes to the capping provisions seem to be rather technical amendments.
The committee understands the need to realign rural development legislation with the December 2005 European Council Agreement. However, budgetary decisions should normally follow legislative decisions and not the other way around. Moreover, the practice by which individual Member States are being persuaded to vote in favour of an agreement, by including particular extra amounts or preferential treatment for them (the so called Christmas gifts) is highly undesirable. Also for reasons of transparency, unity and sound financial management the practice of this kind of horse treading should be prevented.

Economic and monetary affairs
Integration of EU mortgage market should benefit the public directly
2006-11-10 - 16:58
MEPs are to debate the mortgage market in the EU as they consider a report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which says a well-focused integration of the market would bring benefits to consumers. The report, drawn up by John Purvis (EPP-ED, UK), is Parliament’s response to a Commission discussion paper on the mortgage market.
The report says that any EU level action should aim principally at directly improving the situation for the public, notably by widening access to mortgages, for example to people with fixed term contracts. Stressing the need for extensive consultation in deciding on any EU action, MEPs say there are numerous obstacles to a single retail market in mortgages and call on the Commission to focus on targeted measures offering the greatest benefits, via market-led initiatives wherever possible.
The committee calls for harmonisation of provisions for pre-contractual information, noting that if lenders offer credit in a Member State other than their own, this information must be available in the language(s) of the consumer’s Member State. The Commission should consider making the existing Code of Conduct in this area mandatory, says the report. Lenders should make available information on all the costs involved, not just the interest rate.
MEPs in the committee stress the importance of a single, open and compatible funding market as a first priority, as a way to diversify risk, boost efficiency and reduce costs. They urge the Commission to examine the legal and technical barriers to such a development, and support action to abolish discriminatory tax obstacles, such as different fiscal treatment of local and foreign lenders. They support the Commission’s action to facilitate cross-border mergers in financial services, while noting that these in themselves will not promote integration of the retail market.
The committee recognises the important role of mortgage brokers and similar intermediaries and asks the Commission to consult on an appropriate regulatory environment for them and prepare a proposal.

Euro
MEPs to debate economic performance of the euro area
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Parliament will discuss the economic challenges facing the euro area, as MEPs examine a report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee on the issue. The report gives an overview of Parliament’s position on a wide range of economic issues. Drawn up by José Manuel Garcia-Margallo y Marfil (EPP-ED, ES), the non binding report is Parliament’s response to the first edition of what will be an annual report from the Commission on the situation of the euro area.
On macroeconomic policy, the committee calls for more transparency on the decision making process at the European Central Bank (ECB) and urges Member States to stick to a strict interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact, notably by pursuing an annual improvement in cyclically adjusted budget deficits of 0.5 per cent of GDP. MEPs in the committee repeat their call for better coordination of national fiscal calendars, with national budgetary projections based on similar criteria.
The report stresses the urgency of implementing the Lisbon Strategy on economic reform equally across all the areas concerned, and reiterates Parliament’s call for a league table to show which Member States are making most, and least, progress. The committee repeats is support for developing a common consolidated corporate tax base, if necessary via the enhanced cooperation mechanism which allows a group of Member States to go ahead with project between themselves, even if the whole EU does not want to take part.
Turning to the internal market, MEPs in the committee condemn the protectionist policies adopted by some Member States and stresses the need for more action to open up the fragmented retail financial services markets. They call on Member States to allocate more resources to research and development, and argue that labour markets should be made more flexible. The creation of an internal market for energy should be a high priority.
On the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union, the committee agrees that disparities in growth and inflation rates within the euro area are increasingly due to structural reasons. Welcoming Slovenia to the euro, MEPs in the committee ask the Commission and ECB to evaluate whether it is justified to use different price stability criteria for accession to the euro than those for setting interest rates.
The committee argues that greater efforts should be made to coordinate representation of the euro area countries in international financial institutions. It also calls for regular meetings between the European Parliament and national parliaments on economic issues, and for the Commission and the Eurogroup to establish a regular dialogue with Parliament on economic matters along the lines of that already existing with the ECB on monetary policy.

Commission Legislative and work programme for 2007
2006-11-10 - 16:58
MEPs will debate the Commission's Legislative and Work programme for 2007. All Commissioners are expected to be present for the three hour debate. MEPs will also vote on a resolution on the work programme during the December plenary. This Work Programme maps out what the Commission will do to meet its strategic objectives in 2007. To develop its programme for 2007, the Commission has had the benefit of the reactions from the European Parliament, the Council and the other institutions to the Annual Policy Strategy for 2007. The structured dialogue established under the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission and the "summary report" adopted by the Conference of Presidents have been particularly valuable and have illustrated how common goals can be worked into concrete actions and tangible results.
• As regards prosperity, the Commission will continue to promote the modernisation of the European economy through the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs, and a dynamic internal market, with an interlocking set of measures to foster knowledge, innovation and a sustainable environment for growth. This includes the creation of a European framework for economic migrants. The Commission will pursue the initiatives to promote external aspects of competitiveness set out in its 4th October 2006 Communication on "Global Europe, competing in the world". Energy will be a major focus, with the first European Strategic Energy Review heralding a new phase in European energy policy to help tackle climate change. The Commission will come forward with its views on the way forward for a new maritime policy.
• Solidarity, environmental protection, sustainable management and use of natural resources, and the health and wellbeing of citizens go hand in hand with growth and jobs. With 2007 being the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", Europeans will again be reminded of the social core at the heart of how Europe works. The Commission will take stock of the social situation in the EU, as requested by the European Council in June 2006, with a particular emphasis on questions of access and opportunity, and in view of building a new consensus on the social challenges facing Europe. Updating policies to match the needs of European society today is a key first step to making solidarity work effectively. It will also have to continue to drive forward its climate policy, with the aim of broadening international co-operation and achieving bigger emission reductions domestically.
Action at European level is needed to ensure a high level of security and justice, safety and protection of citizens Europe faces new risks. Environmental and health risks, communicable diseases and natural disasters, as well as threats from terrorist attacks require rapid and effective response capacity at EU level. Law enforcement and criminal investigation across the EU will be pursued in the fight against crime and violence. Border control will be a key area for action in 2007, together with the extension of the Schengen Area.
• Europe needs to cultivate a strong voice of its own in the world to pursue goals such as sustainable development, global environment, peace, neighbourhood, cooperation and external competitiveness. Scientific, technological and other knowledge-intensive forms of cooperation based on mutual interest and mutual benefits hold particular potential for furthering those objectives Europe needs to improve coherence and coordination of the Commission’s action with the work of the other European institutions and that of the Member States. Equally, Community external policies and the external aspects of internal policies must work together better. Debate : 14.11.2006 Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2007

Framework for European Regulatory Agencies
2006-11-10 - 16:58
MEPs will debate the framework for European Regulatory Agencies after hearing statements from both Commission and Council. A number of specialised and decentralised EU agencies have been established to support the EU Member States and their citizens. These agencies are an answer to a desire for geographical devolution and the need to cope with new tasks of a legal, technical and/or scientific nature. At present, the European Community agencies are:

Energy
Reaction to the recent shortcomings of the European electricity network
2006-11-10 - 16:58
The Commission will make a statement on the shortcomings of the European electricity network followed by a debate with MEPs. Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs reacted to the recent blackouts by saying: "A serious incident on the continental European electricity network on Saturday lead to blackouts over most of the system. The precise reasons why this happened are presently being examined by the Union for the Coordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE)
Commissioner Piebalgs stated that "whilst these blackouts lasted for relatively short periods of time, they are unacceptable. The EU needs an internal market based on the very highest levels of system security. These incidents show, once again, that events in one part of Europe impact on other parts and again confirm the need for a proper European energy policy. Energy security is better delivered through a common European approach rather than 27 different approaches."
I have written to UCTE as well as to the European Transmission System Operators (ETSO) requesting that they rapidly establish the precise cause of the blackout and establish the measures that will be taken to ensure that it does not reoccur. In addition, I have asked the European Regulators Group to meet as soon as possible to provide a report to the Commission on the lessons to be learned from this event.
However, this also demonstrates that the existing situation regarding network security in Europe needs to be strengthened. It must be a key part of the European Energy Policy to be announced by the Commission at the beginning of next year. In particular I intend to propose to the College (i) that a formal European grouping of Transmission System Operators be created at EU level which will have the task of putting forward common positions on issues identified by the Commission and in particularly network security standards, (ii) institute a mechanism to ensure that these standards are formally binding on network operators and (iii) propose a European Priority Interconnection Plan to make quicker progress on ensuring that essential new interconnectors are built."

Ombudsman
Ombudsman's 2005 annual report
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Andreas SCHWAB (EPP-ED, DE) for the Petitions Committee will be presenting an own-initiative report on the Ombudsman's 2005 annual report. It declares its satisfaction with the public profile of the Ombudsman, welcomes the generally constructive cooperation between the Ombudsman and the institutions and endorsed him in his role of "external control mechanism and, in addition, as a valuable source of ongoing improvement to European administration". MEPs in the committee express their appreciation of the Ombudsman's good cooperation with Parliament's Committee on Petitions, but stress the need for "a clear definition and demarcation" of his role vis-à-vis that committee and urge him to "continue to remain within his terms of reference" when seeking to assist citizens. They acknowledge, however, that when the Ombudsman and the Petitions Committee investigate overlapping issues, "they can achieve useful synergy through close cooperation".
The committee particularly welcomes the Ombudsman's special report on the openness of meetings of the Council when acting in its legislative capacity, and calls on the Council to act on the Ombudsman's - and Parliament's - recommendations and to ensure in future that all the meetings in which it acts in its legislative capacity are open and accessible to the public. As part of the efforts to boost transparency, the report also calls on future Council presidencies to do their best to provide Internet pages in all the official languages of the EU. Other proposals included establishing the entry portal http://europa.eu as the uniform entry page for all EU institutions to make life simpler for citizens and avoid unnecessary confusion from sites existing in parallel.
The report welcomes the introduction of new internal procedures at the Commission when it comes to answering inquiries from the Ombudsman, whereby individual Commissioners assume sponsorship for a specific case. It calls on the Commission to introduce this kind of procedure for the processing of petitions as well. The committee also welcomes the European Network of Ombudsmen and called for a further strengthening of exchanges of best practice.
Lastly, noting that nearly 70% of complaints still fall outside the European Ombudsman's terms of reference, the committee says that there is a need for a better communication strategy to ensure that the public was given more information about what the Ombudsman can and cannot do. It encourages the Ombudsman to "continue to place great emphasis himself on events involving citizens and, hence, potential complainants since clearly the demarcation of responsibilities and decision-making processes between the European, national and regional levels are still too hard to grasp for many citizens and businesses".

Culture
A new framework strategy for multilingualism
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Bernat JOAN I MARÍ (Greens/EFA, ES) will be putting forward an own-initiative report (Greens/ALE, ES) on the Commission's new framework strategy for multilingualism. According to a recent Eurobarometer survey, half of the EU's citizens say they can hold a conversation in a second language apart from their mother tongue. The Committee on Culture and Education therefore welcomes the Commission's action to promote languages in the Community. MEPs in the committee are calling for a clear, coherent EU language plan and EU language legislation.
Members say that, in doing so, linguistic diversities and language rights could be ensured. They also asked that the European institutions and bodies improve their communication with citizens in their own national language, regardless of whether the language has official status at Member State or EU level. This could also improve the rights of the 46 millions EU citizens who speak lesser used languages (like Gaelic, Welsh, Frisian, Catalan and Basque).
The committee also considers that there is a lack of detailed and reliable data and appropriate indicators related to the current situation of foreign language competence in the Member States and therefore welcomed the proposal for a European Indicator of Language Competence. This indicator should include all official EU languages and could be extended beyond the five widely-spoken languages to include the other EU languages, in order to gain a true picture of language competence.
Members also take the view that the widest opportunities should be provided for migrants to learn the language of host countries. They also welcome the greater use of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), where pupils learn a subject through the medium of a foreign language. Finally, the Committee supports a European Standard for Translation Services and believes that there should be a proactive policy for developing translation services for less widely used languages.
Use of English and support for smaller languages
The committee supports the proposals to develop language-related professions and industries; all European languages will need new technologies such as speech processing, voice recognition and so on, as well work on terminology, developing language teaching, certification and testing; otherwise lesser-used languages will be left behind with their linguistic social space taken over by the more widely spoken languages - especially English.

Culture
Improving communications and coverage of the EU
2006-11-10 - 16:58
The Committee on Culture and Education says that the European Commission should support the creation of a European public space dedicating sufficient coverage to European affairs. In its reaction to Commissioner's Wallström's proposals for changes in EU communication policy, it also calls for more information on EU affairs on public television throughout Europe, but rejects the idea of a code of conduct for all EU institutions on communication with citizens. Parliament will debate an own-initiative report on the Commission's White Paper on a European communication policy, but is likely to reject the Commission's proposal to submit all EU institutions to a code of conduct regulating their communication with EU citizens. Rapporteur Luis HERRERO-TEJEDOR (EPP-ED, ES) takes the view that laying down rules of conduct for the elected European Parliament could lead to adverse consequences, reducing the scope for independent opinion.
The White Paper is one of the Commission's initiatives aimed at improving the EU's interaction with its citizens following the 'no' votes in referendums on the proposed EU constitution in France and the Netherlands. MEPs in the committee say that to reach citizens it was important to communicate better and to show the relevance of EU decisions on their daily life.
Through cooperation with regional and local institutions, emphasis should be placed on communicating regularly with citizens about the relevant regional and local projects in which the EU had anticipated. National public television should be encouraged to properly inform citizens of what is happening at EU level. Finally, the Commission is asked to use pristine and concise language when communicating with the media and the citizens and to avoid the use of the EU jargon, which increased rather than closed the gap between institutions and citizens.

Security and defence
Foreign Affairs Committee favours a more robust security and defence policy
2006-11-10 - 16:58
"The EU is on the way to developing into a Defence and Security Union," says a report put forward by the Foreign Affairs Committee. It argues for a more active European Security and Defence Policy, extending the Union's competencies in the field. In the own-initiative report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy (ESS), drafted by the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, Karl VON WOGAU (EPP-ED, DE), the committee recognises the "excellent analysis of the threats to the modern world" of the ESS, but emphasised "the need to monitor its implementation on a regular basis, in order to be able to react to geopolitical developments." The report argues for including the "increasing worldwide competition for sources of water and energy, as well as natural disasters and the security of the Union's external borders" in the future development of the ESS, which it says necessitates a revision in 2008 at the latest.
Towards a Security and Defence Union
Although the report "emphasises that, in the event of an attack by the armed forces of a third country on the territory of the Union, NATO remains the guarantor of collective defence," it "points out that the EU is on the way to developing into a Defence and Security Union, as well." In this field, the report calls for the European Security and Defence Policy capabilities of the Union to be strengthened by the setting up of a common defence market, a common system of intelligence and communications standards and a European civil protection force
In addition, the report "stresses the importance of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe," especially the sections that would set up a solidarity clause in case of catastrophes, and a clause on mutual assistance, in case of an attack on one of the Member States. It favours the Constitution's plans to create a post of European Foreign Minister, as well as supporting the creation of a Deputy Foreign Minister in charge of security and defence policy. The Committee voted to ask for a European budget that would cover the military field as well. Finally, it suggests the "setting up of a European standing naval force in the Mediterranean Sea in order to demonstrate European presence and enhance the EU's crisis management potential in this region."
Preventive and non-military actions
Members of the committee also discussed preventive measures, emphasising that "the Union, in light of new threats, must be ready to act before crises break out and take early preventive action," although always in line with the United Nations Charter. They also stressed that "the EU's greatest contribution to preventing international terrorism will be its capacity to be effective in the building or rebuilding of democratic institutions, social and economic infrastructure, good governance and civil society, and successfully combating racism and xenophobia."

MEPs to debate the threat of biological weapons and cluster bombs
2006-11-10 - 16:58
The House will debate the dangers of biological weapons and cluster bombs after hearing statements from both the Commission and the Council. The Council of Ministers note entitled "Fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - EU strategy against proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction" of December 2003 states:
"Biological weapons proliferation: although effective deployment of biological weapons requires specialised scientific knowledge including the acquisition of agents for effective dissemination, the potential for the misuse of the dual-use technology and knowledge is increasing as a result of rapid developments in the life sciences. Biological weapons are particularly difficult to defend against (due to their lack of signature). Moreover, the consequence of the use may be difficult to contain depending on the agent used and whether humans, animals, or plants are the targets. They may have particular attractions for terrorists. Biological weapons, as well as chemical weapons, pose a special threat in this respect. Council and Commission statements

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Women in international politics
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Balanced participation by both sexes in decision-making is an essential condition for democracy, says the Women's Rights Committee who is putting forward a report focusing on the situation of women's participation in international and national politics and decision-making. The report drafted by Ana Maria GOMES (PES, PT) "deeply regrets that in spite of a large number of political statements and recommendations, programmes of actions adopted worldwide and specific legislation introduced at national level, inequality and gender discrimination and under representation of women in politics still persist in Europe and worldwide"
Numbers are not encouraging, of all parliaments worldwide (lower house and upper house combined) only 16,4 % are women (or 7,195 out of 43,961). In the European Parliament 30 % of 732 MEPs (222) are female. This marks "a fundamental democratic deficit both at European level and in the wider international context". The percentage of women elected to the EP ranges from 58 % (Sweden) to 0 % (Malta, Cyprus) depending on the Member State. This low participation "deprives Europe of a precious human potential", says the committee.
The low level of participation by women in centres of decision-making and governance is often linked to problems with combining work and family life, to the unequal distribution of family responsibilities and to discrimination at work and in occupational training, highlights the Committee who calls on the Member States to put in place measures aiming at the reconciliation of social, family and professional life in line with the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council and the Lisbon Strategy.
The report proposes a number of measures on national, European and international level to come to terms with this issue and promote parity in politics, for example educational programmes, a new World Conference on Women and calls on Member States to review their Constitution, legislation and practice with the aim of ensuring that gender equality be enshrined as a fundamental principle. The report also stresses the important role of political parties in each country, and encourages parties to favour women's participation and to set a bracket of a minimum of 40 % and a maximum of 60 % of representation of both sexes.
MEPs also stress the need to look beyond numbers, and actually focus on how women active in politics influence the shaping of governance and conflict resolution, and how they contribute towards ensuring that governance reforms, accountability and the rule of law are highly placed on the political agenda at national and international level.
Finally the committee emphasises that the future European Institute for Gender Equality will have an important role to promote women's representation in international politics. Rapporteur Ana Maria GOMES PES PT A6-0362/2006 Women in international politics Procedure : own-initiative

United National Convention against corruption
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Giusto CATANIA (GUE/NGL, IT) for the Civil Liberties Committee will be putting forward a non-binding report recommending that the EU accedes to the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).
The UN General Assembly decided in 2000 to establish an ad hoc committee to draw up an international legal instrument against corruption independent of the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC). The ad hoc committee negotiated the Convention between January 2002 and October 2003. The EC represented the European Community's interests and considers that the objectives set by the Council have been attained. The text of the UNCAC was adopted in October 2003. The Treaty entered into force in December, 2005, following the 30th ratification.
On 15 September 2005, the EC and the Council Presidency signed the Convention on behalf of the European Community. All the current EU member states and acceding states have signed the convention, with the exception of Slovenia and Estonia. Ratification has already been received from: Austria, Finland, France, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, UK, Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia.

Justice and home affairs
Taking action against trafficking in human beings
2006-11-10 - 16:58
The Parliament will debate and vote on an integrated approach and proposals for action plan on fighting trafficking in human beings. MEPs in the Civil Liberties Committee recommend that "human trafficking should be converted from a "low risk (high reward enterprise for organised crime") into a high risk (low reward one). Law enforcement must use all the resources and capacity available to enforce the prohibition of human trafficking to deprive it of any economic advantage. They also add that "the investigation of human trafficking should be afforded the same priority as other areas of organised crime in that specialist investigative techniques and disruption strategies should be employed".
As to judicial and police cooperation, the report recommends that "Member States should ensure the necessary organizational structures, specialised personnel and adequate financial resources for their law enforcement authorities to be able effectively to combat human trafficking". MEPs add that: "Member States should ensure that national law enforcement agencies regularly involve Europol in the exchange of information (etc...)".
MEPs recommend that "Member States and the Commission should strengthen political dialogue third countries bilaterally and multilaterally on the human rights dimensions of anti-trafficking policies and continue to raise the issue in relevant regional and multilateral forums". The EU "recognises the importance of taking forward a human rights and victims-centred approach. Member States should ensure that the human rights of victims of trafficking are protected fully at all stages (etc...)".
Finally, MEPs recommend that "regional solutions to prevent trafficking in human beings and to ensure the safe return and reintegration of victims are essential. Member States and the Commission should continue to promote regional initiatives that complement and inspire EU-wide cooperation".
Background information
The Trafficking in Persons Report by the US Department of State Office estimated 600 000 to 800 000 men, women and children are trafficked across international borders each year. Approximately 80% of those are women and girls of which up to 50% are minors. The majority of transnational victims are trafficked with the aim of commercial sexual exploitation.
As the decisive part of trafficking in human beings has an international character, it is necessary to strengthen the international cooperation in the field of investigation, exchange of information, identification of victims, law-enforcement and reintegration. In this cooperation Europol, Eurojust, Frontex and Police Chiefs Task Force have to play a more significant role.
International documents stress the human rights based approach, mainly focusing on victims protection. Since seriousness of human rights abuse is not always transposed into prosecution, some doubts might occur, mainly in labour exploitation as if trafficking is considered primarily as a human rights abuse, the prosecution will weaken.

Succession and wills
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Giuseppe GARGANI (EPP-ED, IT) for the Legal Affairs Committee will be tabling an own initiative report on succession and wills. The committee calls on the Commission, during 2007, to submit a legislative proposal to Parliament in order to deal with succession and wills. The committee calls for that proposal to be drawn up in the light of interinstitutional discussion and in keeping with the detailed recommendations set out at annex.
The Legal Affairs Committee wants the Commission, in the context of the current deliberations on the Civil Justice Funding Programme 2007-2013, to launch a call for proposals for an information campaign regarding cross-border wills and succession matters, targeted at legal practitioners in the field.
The committee calls on the Commission to identify as a priority, within the Civil Justice Funding Programme for 2007-2013, the establishment of a network of civil practitioners to develop mutual confidence and understanding between professionals in this field, share information and develop best practice. Finally, the committee considers that the requested proposal has no financial implications for the Community budget.

Industry
European Air Traffic Management
2006-11-10 - 16:58
Erna HENNICOT-SCHOEPGES (EPP-ED, LU), for the Industry Committee, will be putting forward a consultation report by on the Joint Undertaking for the European air traffic management system (SESAR). The aim of SESAR is to set up a joint undertaking to create a new-generation European air traffic management system. SESAR is the technological element of the European single sky. In a proposed non-binding amendment, MEPs in the committee clarify the foreseen timetable and the three separate phases in terms of time period and content. Further proposed amendments deal with issues like safeguards for financial participation by the private sector, intellectual property rights, potential conflicts of interest, the statutes of the joint undertaking and their review, the procedure for the accession of new members and voting rights on the administrative board, and finally, the involvement of the European Parliament.
The modernisation of air traffic management in Europe is necessary since projections for the development of air traffic in Europe show that it should more than double in the next 20 years, or even triple in some regions, particularly central Europe. The present air traffic control (ATC) systems are based on technologies that are 20 years old, if not older and are approaching its limits. The ATC infrastructure is fragmented and only interoperable in part, so it cannot meet the challenges of the coming years: greater safety, increased traffic, energy efficiency and environmental constraints. There is a pressing need for innovation.
The European Commission has accordingly launched the European plan for modernising air traffic control (SESAR), in cooperation with the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) and, in principle, with financial support from the private sector. This configuration forms a public-private partnership (PPP) with a tripartite financial structure.
The challenge is to develop technologies, methods of organisation and industrial components that are capable of ensuring the safety and fluidity of air transport in the next 20 years in Europe and in the world.
The project is organised in three stages:
The definition phase (2005-2007) sets out the ATM Master Plan, defining the technologies to be developed and methods of organisation. Funding of 60 million euros is provided by the European budget and Eurocontrol (50/50).
The development phase (2008-2013), in which systems will be designed and their critical components produced, is estimated at about 300 million euros a year (1/3 European budget, 1/3 Eurocontrol, 1/3 private sector).
The deployment phase (2014-2020) will, according to the Commission, be financed by the private sector and installed on a wide scale in Europe and the associated countries.

External/international trade
EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)
2006-11-10 - 16:58
The Commission will make a statement on the EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). Trade has proved to be one of the most effective tools to foster development. Increased trade with developing countries will enhance their export earnings, promote their industrialisation and encourage the diversification of their economies. The classical instrument for achieving these objectives is tariff preferences, that is to say that the goods we import from developing countries are not submitted to the normal customs duties. Tariff preferences provide an incentive to traders to import products from developing countries, and help them to compete on international markets.
In 1968, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) recommended the creation of a "Generalised System of Tariff Preferences" under which industrialised countries would grant trade preferences to all developing countries. This authorises developed countries to establish individual GSP schemes.
The European Community was the first to implement a GSP scheme in 1971. The EU's GSP grants products imported from GSP beneficiary countries either duty-free access or a tariff reduction, depending on which of the GSP arrangements a country enjoys. The EU's GSP is implemented following cycles of ten years, for which general guidelines are drawn up. Guidelines for the period 2006 - 2015 were adopted in 2004. In practice, the GSP is implemented by means of Council regulations, during the ten-year cycle. Based on the guidelines of 2004, a new GSP scheme was adopted on 27 June 2005, through Council Regulation (EC) No 980/2005. This regulation applies from 1.1.2006 to 31.12.2008, but the provisions concerning the special incentive scheme for sustainable development and good governance (the "GSP-plus" or "GSP+" incentive) applied already from 1.7.2005. The special arrangements to combat drug production and trafficking provided for by Regulation No. 2501/2001 are repealed from that same date. All texts may be found in the list of legislation on the relevant page of this website.
For the period 01.01.2006 - 31.12.2008, there are three types of arrangement in force for beneficiary countries, under the EU's GSP in Regulation (EC) No 980/2005:
All beneficiary countries enjoy the benefit of the general arrangement;
the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (the "GSP+") provides additional benefits for countries implementing certain international standards in human and labour rights, environmental protection, the fight against drugs, and good governance (see Commission Decision 2005/924/EC for the list of GSP+ beneficiary countries);
the special arrangement for the least-developed countries (LDCs), also known as the "Everything But Arms" (EBA) initiative, provides for the most favourable treatment of all, in the aim of granting the LDCs "duty-free and quota-free" access to the EU's market.
