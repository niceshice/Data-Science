The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, informed this Thursday the Conference of Presidents (political group chairs) of his contacts in connection with the situation in the Middle East and called for an immediate end to the violence, from which the civilian population is suffering most.
President Pöttering held talks yesterday with the Israeli President, Shimon Peres, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Salam Fayad, and the European Union's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, and today with the President of the Knesset, Dalia Itzik. A few days ago the Parliament President, who is also President of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, already had contacts with the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly, Abdel Hadi al-Majali (President of the Jordanian Parliament), Gianfranco Fini (President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies) and Mustapha Mansouri (President of the Moroccan Parliament).
President Pöttering made the following statement:
"The European Parliament strongly advocates an immediate end to the violence from which the civilian population is suffering most. The European Union must involve itself in the Middle East peace process diplomatically, politically and, under the auspices of the United Nations and together with other partners, with European security forces, too. The only workable basis for a lasting peace is and remains a two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine as sovereign States within secure borders. The European Parliament will continue its commitment in the region and support all efforts which may bring about peace on this basis."
