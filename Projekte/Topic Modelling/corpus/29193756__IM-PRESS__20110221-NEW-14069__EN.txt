Libya turmoil, Middle East peace process and UN Human Rights Council
2011-03-03 - 17:16
The latest developments in the EU's southern neighbourhood and in Libya in particular, including the latter's recent suspension from the UN Human Rights Council, as well as the state of play of the Middle East Peace process, will take centre stage on Wednesday afternoon when MEPs debate these issues with EU High Representative Catherine Ashton. Ahead of the extraordinary European Council of Friday 11 March, MEPs will discuss the EU's response to the rapidly changing situation in Libya, including possible additional sanctions, humanitarian aid, support for human rights and democracy and economic assistance for the whole North African region.
UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva
MEPs will also discuss the United Nations General Assembly's decision, reached "by consensus", to suspend Libya from the UN Human Rights Council, which is currently holding its 16th session in Geneva until 25 March.
Parliament will be represented at the Geneva session from 16 to 18 March by three MEPs: Human Rights Subcommittee chair Heidi Hautala (Greens/EFA, FI), vice-chair Laima Liucija Andrikienė (EPP, LT) and Jörg Leichtfried (S&D, AT).
Parliament's other priorities for the Geneva meeting are the human rights situations in North Korea and Burma/Myanmar, freedom of religion or belief, rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and reform of the Human Rights Council itself.
Middle East peace process
Catherine Ashton, the High Representative of the Union for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, will brief Members about the latest Quartet meeting (EU, the US, Russia, and the UN), held on 5 February. The Quartet condemned rocket fire from Gaza, and regretted the end of Israel's moratorium on settlement activity, underlining that the current break in negotiations is detrimental to peace and security prospects.
Following Wednesday's debates, Parliament will vote on Thursday on two resolutions: on the situation in Libya and on the UN Human Rights Council.
Procedure: Statement by EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs followed by debate (with resolution by political groups)

EU ambitions of Turkey and Montenegro under the spotlight
2011-03-03 - 17:16
Parliament will debate the progress of Turkey and Montenegro in their EU membership negotiations and then vote on resolutions drafted by the Foreign Affairs Committee. The resolutions express concern at the slowing progress on human rights in Turkey but welcome Montenegro's official candidate status despite concerns over corruption and organised crime. The Cyprus-Turkey deadlock, the lack of dialogue among Turkish political parties and the undermining of press freedom and other basic rights in Turkey are the key factors slowing down this country's EU accession talks, say Foreign Affairs Committee MEPs in their annual report.
As the result of a complex agreement between the EP's political groups, the draft resolution avoids mentioning the goal of full EU membership for Turkey. Instead it describes negotiations as a "long-lasting and open-ended process".
On Montenegro, MEPs endorse the decision by European governments to grant the country "candidate status", allowing formal negotiations to begin. MEPs would like talks about EU accession to start sometime after the Commission issues its annual progress report later this year. However, they also voice concerns, particularly about corruption, organised crime, discrimination and curbs on media freedom.

EU strategy for Roma: MEPs set out priorities
2011-03-03 - 17:16
Europe's 10-12 million Roma people need EU-wide measures to promote their social, cultural and economic integration, says a draft resolution by the EP Civil Liberties Committee, which seeks to influence the Commission's upcoming European strategy for Roma inclusion. Much of the Roma population in Europe is poor and marginalised, in both rural and urban areas. EU policy and financial tools to support Roma inclusion do exist but they could work more effectively with binding minimum standards and better monitoring at European level.
Equal access for Roma to employment, education and quality housing, the protection of fundamental rights, better use of EU funding and fighting against discrimination at all levels are among MEPs' main aims. This will require greater effort from local, national and EU authorities.
The Commission should present a roadmap with binding minimum standards at EU level and Member States should face penalties for non-compliance, says the draft resolution, drawn up for the Civil Liberties Committee by Lívia Járóka (EPP, HU).
The Commission is expected to present its proposal on an EU strategy for Roma inclusion in April, while the European Council is due to adopt the strategy at its meeting on 24 June. Roma inclusion is one of the Hungarian Presidency's priorities.

EP to debate Treaty change to allow eurozone stability mechanism
2011-03-03 - 17:16
MEPs will debate the proposal of the European Council to make a limited Treaty change to allow a permanent stability mechanism to be set up for the eurozone. The plenary vote is expected to take place at the session of 23-24 March. The EU Member States decided at their summit of 16-17 December 2010 on a limited Treaty change allowing the creation of a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the eurozone's stability. This "revision of Article 136" of the Treaty requires consultation of Parliament, Commission and the European Central Bank.
Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee is set to vote on a draft report on the issue on Monday 7 March. The aim is to have the opinion of Parliament before the European Council meeting on 24–25 March, where the Member States hope to adopt the Treaty change formally. Thereafter, it still needs to be ratified by all 27 Member States. The target date for the entry into force of the permanent stability mechanism is 1 January 2013.

100 years of women's rights - but inequality and poverty persist
2011-03-03 - 17:16
Parliament will mark the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day (Tuesday 8 March) with a debate and vote on two resolutions tabled by the Women's Rights Committee: one on gender equality and the other on female poverty. The debate will be opened at 11.30am on Tuesday by EP President Buzek, followed by Commission President Barroso, European affairs minister Enikő Győri for the Hungarian Presidency, the chair of the EP Women's Rights Committee and a round of political group speakers.
A press conference then takes place at 12 noon in the press conference room with Mr Buzek, Commissioner Viviane Reding and Women's Rights Committee chair Eva-Britt Svensson.
On Tuesday afternoon, a journalists' workshop with MEPs and outside experts will be held on how to increase the number of women in leadership positions, e.g. by means of quotas, and looking at past achievements and future measures. This starts at 2pm in Room WIC 200.
Tackling inequality
The need to narrow the gender pay gap, to get more women in decision-making positions and to raise the female employment rate are among key points in the draft resolution accompanying the 2010 annual report on equality between women and men in the EU, drafted by Mariya Nedelcheva (EPP, BG). The importance of better child care facilities and child-related leave is also highlighted.
If women’s employment, part-time employment and productivity rates were similar to men’s, GDP would increase by 30%, says the resolution.
Only 3% of major companies are chaired by a woman. Member States should therefore take effective measures, such as quotas, to ensure greater representation for women in major listed companies and on the management boards of companies in general, say MEPs, citing Norway as a positive example, followed by Spain and France.
MEPs also call for binding targets to ensure equal representation of women and men in politics, saying further efforts must be made at EU, national, regional and municipal levels.
Eliminating poverty
Nearly 85 million people in the EU were living below the poverty line in 2008, and 17% of all women in the EU were living in poverty, notes the second resolution - on the face of female poverty - drafted by Rovana Plumb (S&D, RO).
Economic recovery plans should promote female employment, while macroeconomic, social and labour-market policies should be reformed, to guarantee a minimum income as well as economic and social justice for women. All EU common policies should have a gender perspective, stresses the resolution.

Iran: new sanctions for human rights abuses?
2011-03-03 - 17:16
Future EU relations with Iran - including possible further sanctions - should focus not only on the nuclear dispute but also on human rights abuses since the 2009 presidential elections, argues a draft resolution by the Foreign Affairs Committee scheduled for a vote on Thursday. Iran's execution of Dutch-Iranian citizen Zahra Bahrami is firmly condemned by the committee. MEPs also believe the time has come for the EU to devise a new, broader, strategy towards Iran going beyond the nuclear issue and addressing Iran's human rights record and regional role.
The draft resolution calls upon EU foreign ministers to impose sanctions on Iranian officials responsible for serious human rights abuses since the disputed presidential election of June 2009, in line with similar measures taken by the USA in September 2010.
Strongly condemning the execution of Dutch Iranian citizen Zahra Bahrami in January this year, the committee also regrets that the number of executions in Iran in 2009 was the highest in the past ten years and calls on the government to impose a moratorium on such executions and to abolish the execution of minors.
Regarding Iran's continuing refusal to co-operate with the International Atomic Energy Agency, MEPs say "additional sanctions have become the logical consequence". However, they also want the EU Foreign Affairs High Representative to assess the impact and effectiveness of all EU restrictive measures. Sanctions are meant to hit blacklisted officials, not the Iran population as a whole, they warn.

Priorities for Parliament's 2012 budget
2011-03-03 - 17:16
MEPs will debate Parliament's budget for 2012 on Monday afternoon before voting on a resolution on Tuesday. Priorities are expected to include maintaining the standard of the EP's legislative work, reducing its environmental impact and keeping the budget increase within the inflation rate. The resolution, drafted by José Manuel Fernandes (EPP, PT), marks the first step of the EP's internal budget procedure. In April Parliament will adopt a more detailed proposal, including full figures, prepared by its Bureau (President and Vice-Presidents). The report on the main EU budget, managed by the Commission, will be adopted at a later stage, at another plenary session.

Economic governance debate with Commission President
2011-03-03 - 17:16
Parliament will convey its views and possibly warnings about the design of a new economic governance model, in a debate with Commission President Barroso on Tuesday. MEPs are expected to call for a break with previous models that are deemed to have failed due to a lack of involvement by all relevant players as well as faulty structures which allowed countries too much bargaining room.
They are also likely to warn of undesirable overlapping between the economic governance legislative package and plans being devised by some Member States to shore up competitiveness.
This debate comes three days before a summit of Eurozone heads of state, who are meeting in Brussels to discuss the creation of a permanent bailout fund and to coordinate their position on the next steps for economic governance.

Mauritania fisheries agreement: safeguarding sustainable development
2011-03-03 - 17:16
On Monday evening, Parliament will discuss the upcoming negotiations with Mauritania for the renewal of what is described as "the most important" of EU fisheries agreements with African countries. MEPs want the Commission to give an assessment of the current agreement, including the way EU funds are used, and to explain its plans for ensuring that fishing activities in that area are carried out sustainably.
Parliament's main concern is to preserve a balance between the economic development of Mauritania and the conservation of resources. However, MEPs will also ask the Commission how it intends to use the reform of the common fisheries policy to incorporate EU human rights clauses in the next fishing agreement with Mauritania.
The current agreement, due to expire on 1 August 2012, covers vessels from France, Germany, Greece Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherland, Poland, Portugal, Spain and United Kingdom. Negotiations on the new accord are scheduled to start in April this year. Once finalised, the agreement will need Parliament's consent to come into force.

Novel financing solutions to financial crisis and climate problems
2011-03-03 - 17:16
Parliament will on Monday discuss options for raising more revenue from the financial services sector and from higher taxation on CO2 emissions. Such measures should also deter speculation and cut pollution. A resolution will be put to the vote on Tuesday. A financial transactions tax could be devised to raise around €200 billion per year in the EU and make speculative trading less attractive, argues the draft resolution tabled by the Economics Committee. It also calls for more measures to reduce tax evasion and tax fraud as well as greater integration of the polluter-pays principle into taxation policy, focusing on CO2 emissions.

Trade agreements must not jeopardise EU agriculture
2011-03-03 - 17:16
No concessions that could undermine the EU farming sector should be made in negotiations on trade agreements, says a draft resolution by the Agriculture Committee. MEPs criticise the Commission's approach to trade negotiations for putting the interests of industry and services ahead of the needs of agriculture. They also want the MERCOSUR trade talks suspended to allow for a new mandate to be prepared that incorporates the views - neglected until now - of the newer EU Member States.

An industrial policy for the globalised era
2011-03-03 - 17:16
An eco-efficient and globally competitive knowledge industry could act as a launch pad for sustainable growth and employment in Europe, according to a draft resolution by the Industry Committee. Red tape should be cut, smaller companies promoted and competitiveness boosted by improving quality, says the resolution, drafted by Bernd Lange (S&D, DE).
It urges the EU to develop an ambitious, eco-efficient strategy to promote high-tech green manufacturing, which would create highly qualified and well-paid jobs.
MEPs insist that a combination of innovation, sustainability and decent work could be an all-round winner, stimulating the economy, reducing environmental degradation and improving the quality of life of Europe's citizens.

Economic crisis could widen health inequalities
2011-03-03 - 17:16
MEPs are warning that rising unemployment and economic austerity could worsen existing health inequalities. Parliament will vote on a resolution calling for better monitoring of ill health as well as preventive measures, with a special focus on minorities. To achieve optimum spending of health budgets, preventive and education measures must be improved, argues the draft resolution, tabled by the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee.
According to Eurostat, life expectancy across EU Member States varies by 14.2 years for men and 8.3 years for women (2007 and 2010 figures respectively). Within countries too, groups of different education levels and social situations have widely varying health prospects.

EU measures to secure supplies of rare earth elements
2011-03-03 - 17:16
Following China's decision to restrict exports of rare earth elements, MEPs will ask the Commission if the EU has a comprehensive strategy on these minerals and if it has assessed the security of supply for European industry. EU industry depends totally on China for imports of rare earth elements, which are critical for high-tech appliances and the development of green technologies.
Parliament wants to hear if there are concrete EU measures for securing future supplies, such as stockpiling, recycling and alternative sources. China controls 97% of world production of these minerals and 36% of the world’s known reserves. It has a competitive advantage in refining ores, producing alloys and end products, while EU industry lacks both the access to raw materials and the know-how for processing them.
Procedure: Oral question to Commission

A regional strategy for the Atlantic
2011-03-03 - 17:16
By June this year the Commission is due to present an EU strategy for the Atlantic, based on the findings of a public consultation concluded in October 2010. MEPs from the regions concerned wish to know the results, to hear the Commission's plans and to highlight their own priorities. The Atlantic strategy is expected to seek improved cross-border cooperation between coastal regions, particularly with regard to the environment, economy and maritime governance. Similar approaches have been devised for the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Arctic.

Swine flu: lessons to learn from "disproportionate" EU response
2011-03-03 - 17:16
With the new influenza season underway, the EU's "disproportionate" response to the outbreak of the H1N1 ("swine flu") virus in 2009-2010 is criticised in a draft resolution on the agenda for Tuesday. The resolution, by the EP's Public Health Committee, looks at the expense of vaccination programmes and the relative risks that were faced. It also recommends action for the future, including group purchasing of vaccines and more safeguards against conflicts of interest.
H1N1 had caused 2,900 deaths in Europe by April 2010, which compares with 40,000 for seasonal flu in a moderate year. EU Member States' responses ranged from wholesale vaccination programmes to none at all (in the case of Poland). Billions of euros were spent in total.

Safer consumer products for the European market
2011-03-03 - 17:16
Children and other vulnerable consumers need better protection from potentially dangerous products, says a draft resolution on product safety by the Internal Market Committee. Better surveillance of imports at customs checks and within the internal market is needed, along with faster withdrawal of dangerous products from the market, say MEPs.
The non-legislative resolution by Christel Schaldemose (S&D, DK), to be put to the vote on Tuesday, constitutes Parliament's input to the forthcoming update of EU product safety rules to be launched by the Commission later this year.

Tax self-sufficiency instead of foreign aid dependence
2011-03-03 - 17:16
Boosting tax revenues in developing countries by fighting tax evasion and harmful tax practices would not only reduce poverty but also generate a 'governance dividend', says a draft resolution by the Development Committee. MEPs want to see more tax-related assistance by the EU as well as a clampdown on tax havens. Developing countries should be able to reduce their reliance on foreign aid by putting in place viable tax systems, says the draft resolution.
According to recent studies, tax fraud in developing countries leads to an annual loss in tax revenue equivalent to ten times the amount of development aid from developed countries.
