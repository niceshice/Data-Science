We asked for your photos and we liked what you sent us Over a period of months we asked people to send us their photos based on a number of themes chosen by us. In this focus you can see some of those were picked. The entries by London-based photographer Mimi Mollica were the ones we liked best and he was invited to Strasbourg in eastern France to take photos of the first session of the European Parliament after the June elections.
You can see Mimi's work in the last section of this focus. Thanks again for all the photos you sent us - we liked them so much we created a special "flickr" account where you can have a look at all those sent in.

"En route to hope" is guest photograph
Dakar, Senegal; many migrants use this road on their attempts to enter Europe "Resolutions for 2009" was the topic we suggested for our first guest photographer project. We had an enthusiastic response with many thought-provoking and amusing photos. We eventually settled on "En route to hope" taken in Dakar, Senegal by Mimi Mollica. Thanks a lot to all those who took part!
Mimi Mollica is a Sicilian born photographer who has been living in London since 1996. His work focuses on social issues, human rights and troubled areas from countries like India, Pakistan, Africa, Cuba and Brazil.
"'En Route To Dakar' depicts a man walking along the motorway being built from Dakar centre to the rest of Senegal. For me it symbolises a journey towards a better life," Mr Mollica said.
"Every year hundreds of Senegalese die in the Atlantic Ocean trying to reach Europe by boat, a dangerous alternative to the far too costly visas to enter the EU. The resolution I suggest for 2009 is for the European Parliament to consider this tragedy and to make relevant changes to the immigration policies and to limit the price for the visas," he said.

Hard times...on camera
"Un giorno da leone" (A day as a Lion) by Maurizio Chelucci We asked people to send in photos on the theme of "hard times" and Rome based Maurizio Chelucci is the one we picked. The 47-year old Italian has been taking photos since a young age and he has entitled this effort as "A day as a Lion". Thanks to all entries which can be viewed on the Flickr account below.
When describing his photo, Maurizio quoted John Belushi in the film "Animal House". "When the going gets tough, the tough get going."
The author of the photo describes what is happening as an example of "a strategy of survival that is not likely to damage any one". He is an event manager and coordinator of exhibitions and has exhibited in Italy and abroad.
Maurizio Chelucci started taking photos when he was fifteen for travel reports in Europe and Africa. Nowadays his activity is more focused on contemporary photography.

"Love can be ambiguous, politics must be crystal-clear”
The photo is taken on the static historical part of the Paris of eastern Europe (Budapest). © Wouter Van Waeyenberg: "love can be ambiguous, politics must be crystalclear" "Love can be ambiguous, politics must be crystal-clear” is the title of the latest photo to be chosen from all those sent in over the last month. We asked people to send us their ideas on "the art of politics" and you can see some of the photos we received in a special flickr account. The photo chosen was taken by Wouter Van Waeyenberg.
Mr Van Waeyenberg is from Geraardsbergen in Belgium. In addition to being an amateur photographer he is studying graphic design in Ghent.
Regarding his photo he said: "The photo is taken on the static historical part of the Paris of eastern Europe (Budapest). It shows a view of the vibrant Pest where culture, religion and economy merge into one".
He told us about the bright future of love (using his personal life as a concrete example,) in contrast with the dark future of humanity. "We all must act now against pollution, but politicians first because they have the biggest impact on problem solving".

"Ploiesti Refineries" chosen as best photograph!
"Ploiesti Refineries" © Michail Moscholios www.michail.f2b.be Thanks to all of you who sent us your photos about the pressing issue of pollution. After much head scratching and deliberation we opted for the haunting "Ploiesti Refineries" by Brussels based photographer Michail Moscholios. The shot, taken in Romania, clearly shows the damage pollution can bring. All the photos sent to us can be found in the flickr site below.
Describing the way he takes photos Michail Moscholios says: "I use the camera in an intuitive manner, trying to capture impressions spontaneously rather than to impose a composition on them. My subjects are continually revisited and reinterpreted."
Influenced by Robert Frank
For "Ploiesti Refineries" he says that the colour of the sky and the "planting" of the girl symbolises ways in which pollution should be dealt with.
He says his inspiration has been the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson, Garry Winogrand, Robert Frank and other photographers of the American "school of street photography".
The photo shows, in the background, the beauty of a sunset and the dark silhouette of an industrial area and, in the foreground, an illuminated woman in white.

A matter of faith
"Una mera cuestión de fe/Just a matter of faith" is our monthly chosen photograph © Carlos Cazurro/ Una mera cuestión de fe / www.cazurro.com In the hamlet of Tiedra just outside Valladolid in Spain, a women hangs a "exvotos" to the Virgin Mary for helping her son pass his university exams. Captured by Carlos Cazzuro this is April's guest photograph. The theme was "multicultural Europe" and we found his portrait of this ancient rite of faith a worthy choice. "A matter of faith" is one of the many photos sent to us which can now be seen on our flickr page.
This Catholic tradition was caught on Polaroid by Carlos Cazzuro, a 33 year old living in Valladolid in north central Spain who has exhibited widely in his native land, Portugal and Brazil and whose twin passions are travelling and photography which complement one another.
"Exvotos" - deeply rooted in Spanish villages
Exvotos are a traditional way of paying homage to the Virgin Mary across Spain, they can be statues, pictures, paintings that symbolise what the person has prayed for.
Describing the photo Carlos explained: "Nowadays with the situation we are facing, lots of people are relying on Saints. The traditions of the exvotos - promises to the Virgin Mary or to another Saint which have been fulfilled - are still deeply rooted in Spanish villages. In the case of Tiedra the exvotos are photos that are hung on one of the chapel's walls."

Shifting generations
"The change of generations " by Daniel Andrei ©Daniel Andrei/www.andreidanielart.blogspot.com Concern about young people not voting and the need for parents to tell children the importance of voting lay behind this month's guest photograph. "The change of generations" by Romanian photographer Daniel Andrei from Constanta on the Black Sea was chosen from scores of entries on the theme "on the way to vote". Thanks to all of you who entered - a full gallery can be found on the flickr account below.
Speaking about the photo, Daniel, who is a student of law and public administration, said: "As parents we have the duty of teaching our children about the importance of voting. Do young people go to vote? Unfortunately, nowadays, youngsters do not have the spirit of voting."
He also said he was concerned about "low levels of participation in elections among younger members of the electorate".

Photo slideshow from Parliament's opening session by Mimi Mollica
As MEPs assemble on Tuesday, a Member surveys the Chamber. Mimi Mollica A selection of flags in front of the side wall of the hemicycle Chamber. Mimi Mollica The distinctive flower or "meadow" carpet on one of the coffee bars. Mimi Mollica The Parliament is set next to water. Mimi Mollica Drinking coffee to combat the long hours and frenetic activity is a common activity. Mimi Mollica People enter the courtyard of the 'Louise Weiss' part of the building in the Strasbourg Assembly. Mimi Mollica A new Parliament meant many MEPs were assigned new seats. Mimi Mollica For many newly elected MEPs, almost 50% of the total, arriving at the EP is a stage in their political walk. Mimi Mollica These trolleys are usually used for the boxes - or canteens - that contain the papers of MEPs. Mimi Mollica The weather in Strasbourg for the opening session was a combination of furnace like heat and then rain. Mimi Mollica A quiet moment of reflection. Mimi Mollica Many MEPs are contemplating their next political steps. Mimi Mollica Shown here is the red carpet and staircase at the VIP entrance. Swedish PM Ferderik Reinfedt took this route on Wednesday as have the likes of President Sarkozy, Abbas and many world leaders in the past. Mimi Mollica The 12 stars represent harmony - time will tell if political harmony among different political blocs will reign in the Plenary Chamber where this photo was taken. Mimi Mollica Covering the "unseen" part of the European Parliament's opening session was the declared ambition of Sicilian born photographer Mimi Mollica. As a participant in the "guest photographer" project he was invited to Strasbourg to cover the Parliament over 13-16 July. His work focuses on social issues, human rights and troubled areas of the world such as India, Pakistan, Africa, Cuba and Brazil.
Now based in London, Mimi told us of his feelings on coming to the Parliament's first session of its 2009-2014 term:
"Strasbourg is known to be the official headquarters of the European Parliament. Here the MEPs get to vote and speak to the press. As a Guest photographer I have been invited to take pictures during the first plenary session of the 2009-2014 legislation, which will have been largely covered by the European press, so I opted to offer a different angle of this reality.
My pictures present the "unseen"
He went on to say my pictures present the "unseen" by the public, a reality existing behind the facade of the political arena. The empty, in-between spaces offer the background to individual figures in resting moments or moving from a place to the other".
Elaborating on this theme he said: "The fine architecture of these buildings reflects the efforts to build an environment consonant with the duties of our deputies. To them, the MEPs, I wish the best for these coming five years in order to improve and work on legislation that is good for us, our future and the growing more pluralistic European society:" Guest photographer
