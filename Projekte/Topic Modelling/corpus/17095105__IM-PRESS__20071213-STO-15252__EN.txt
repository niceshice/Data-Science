As 2007 draws to a close we take a look at some of the most memorable stories of the last year on the European Parliament's website. We took a selection of issues, views and interviews that we have published in the EU's 22 official languages throughout the year. From international news to climate change and cigarette smuggling, we hope they reflect the diverse issues MEPs and the European Parliament dealt with during the year.
Backstage during President Sarkozy's day at the Parliament
When French President Nicolas Sarkozy stepped off a plane at Strasbourg airport at 0945 on Tuesday 11 November, two months of planning by the protocol service of the European Parliament and the Elysée Palace swung into action. The visit of a Head of State is always an important event for the EP and every last detail was worked out ahead of time to ensure it ran smoothly. We had a backstage look at the visit.
As Erasmus turns 20 some MEPs share their memories
Erasmus - the great 15th century theologian and humanist - has for the last two decades given his name to a programme that gives university students a chance to study abroad. So far 1.5 million students have taken part from 31 European countries. The most popular destinations are France and Spain. As Erasmus turns 20, we spoke to three MEPs who in earlier years took advantage of the scheme. With increased funding for 2007, we also ask whether the scheme is just for wealthier students. (Published July).
Climate change rapporteur: "strict but feasible" pollution targets needed
The EU needs to set "strict but feasible" targets on pollution as well as explaining clearly to other international polluters what it has done and is intending to do on climate change. These are the views of German Christian Democrat Karl-Heinz Florenz - Parliament's rapporteur for its new temporary committee on climate change. He predicts that Europe is on the verge of a industrial revolution with new technology. MEPs on the committee have been asked to formulate proposals on EU climate policy. (Interview 14 June).
Cigarette smuggling: MEPs assess EU deal with Marlboro maker Philip Morris
The anti-smuggling alliance between the EU and cigarette giant Phillip Morris has been hailed a success by a Parliamentary draft report adopted on 12 September. The unlikely alliance, concluded in 2004 after the Commission took legal action against the company, has been called a "gold standard" for future agreements by Parliament's rapporteur Bart Staes. Cigarette smuggling is huge; last year in the EU cigarettes worth €460 million in taxes were seized. The trade also fuels organised crime.
Milk reform on menu
Milk is the first food for humans and animals. Thus across cultures milk has come to symbolise life, fertility and health. Cleopatra famously bathed in asses' milk. More prosaically, EU production of this basic foodstuff is regulated under the Common Agricultural Policy. Such regulation has to keep up with trends in production and consumption. The EP will soon debate three reports related to milk reform and the European milk market by German Christian Democrat Elisabeth Jeggle.
"Do not lose hope!" says Bulgarian nurse freed from Libyan death sentence
MEPs stood and applauded yesterday (9 October) in tribute to a group of Bulgarian medics in the public gallery. The 5 Bulgarian medics and 1 Palestinian doctor had until recently been on death row in Libya falsely accused of infecting children with the AIDS virus in Benghazi hospital. The group had been jailed in Libya for over eight years prior to their release in July. One of the group - Kristiana Valcheva - has recently written a book "Head Up". She spoke to us about her imprisonment and liberation.
"Open skies" agreement: consumers vs the environment?
A new agreement opening up the lucrative transatlantic flight market came under scrutiny today (13 March) when Europe's Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot explained the deal to MEPs in Strasbourg. It allows EU airlines to fly from any city in Europe to one in the US while in turn airports in the EU are opened up to US companies. It could pave the way for cheaper fares and add an extra 26 million passengers to the route but the effect on the environment of more flights has been questioned by some MEPs.
We hope you stay with us for more in 2008!
