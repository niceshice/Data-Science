Britain's newest MEP takes up her seat
Glenis Willmott MEP took up her seat in the European Parliament on Wednesday 1st February 2006. Glenis has accepted the Labour seat for the East Midlands following the sudden death of Phillip Whitehead on New Year's Eve.
Phillip Whitehead was first on Labour's list of candidates for the East Midlands in the Euro elections in June 2004 when Labour won one of the six seats for the region. Glenis Willmott was second on Labour's list.
Glenis Willmott said: "Following Phillip Whitehead, who was so highly regarded across the East Midlands and across Europe, will not be easy. He was a class act.
"But I've worked hard for more than 20 years to make a real difference to people's lives. And I'm looking forward to working with colleagues to win the best deal from Europe for people across the East Midlands. "We must bring benefits for all, through a cleaner environment, and a fairer deal for all including consumers, women and disabled people."
