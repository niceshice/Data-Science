Bulgarian MEP Mariya Nedelcheva ©European Union Southern Sudan is expected to become independent 9 July Southern Sudan is composed of more than 200 ethnic groups The goodwill of both the north and south of Sudan are essential if Southern Sudan is to be able to function as the independent state of the Republic of South Sudan, from 9 July, according to Bulgarian MEP Mariya Nedelcheva. She led the European Parliament's election observation mission to monitor the referendum on independence for Southern Sudan 9–15 January. We asked her a few questions about the situation.
Southern Sudan is expected to become independent 9 July after many years of civil war. What are the chances for successful statehood building in the region?
Firstly we have to witness the declaration of independence on 9 July. A lot will depend on the goodwill of both countries to cooperate, as they are - and will be for the foreseeable future - still very much interconnected in economic and social terms. Many issues still have to be resolved in a friendly manner and therefore it is imperative that both countries continue to have good relations.
The most sensitive issue is the oil-rich border-region of Abyei, which still has to decide in a referendum about its fate and thus the definitive border. The essential question of who will manage the funds from oil exploration is still open.
Other issues are the emerging political diversity between North and South, institution building after independence and the question of the integration of migrants from the North who want to settle in the South and how the new state will treat them. There is hardly any infrastructure in the South and no jobs for the newcomers.
Southern Sudan is composed of more than 200 ethnic groups and is one of the most linguistically diverse regions of Africa. Can the EP contribute with its experience in multilingual democracy?
In the EP we can see that linguistic diversity is not an obstacle to the functioning of democracy, thus linguistic diversity is not a problem but enrichment and we have to encourage the country to approach it this way.
Your election observation mission was deployed in both northern and southern Sudan and the referendum appears to have been well-organised and peaceful. What was your main impression from a primarily human point of view?
It was one of the most passionate missions that I have ever witnessed. I do not think that I exaggerate when I say that we have seen a historic moment in Africa. We have seen the will of two countries to resolve such an issue in a peaceful manner. What the people over there expect of us right now, is that we do not come only for a referendum, but that we, the European Union, remain at their side as they strive for freedom and democracy.
