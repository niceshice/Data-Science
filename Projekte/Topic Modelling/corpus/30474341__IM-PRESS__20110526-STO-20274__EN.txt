"Good news for Serbia" Â© BELGA/AFP/P.GUYOT EP President Jerzy Buzek welcomed the arrest of Bosnian war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic in Serbia Thursday. "The arrest is good news for Serbia, for the stability of the region and gives new impetus to Serbia's EU accession process."
"His arrest is convincing proof of Serbia's efforts and cooperation with the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia)," Mr Buzek said.
Ratko Mladic will stand trial at the ICTY in The Hague, accused of a key role in the Srebrenica massacres and other crimes during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He had been on the run for almost 16 years.
