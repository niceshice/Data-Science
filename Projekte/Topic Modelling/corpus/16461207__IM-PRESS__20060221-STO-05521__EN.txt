Patras Lighthouse - Symbol of the city
It is the fourth largest city in Greece, a gateway to the West and at the centre of the archaeological triangle formed by Delphi, Epidaurus and Olympia and this year Patras is also the European Capital of Culture. The city's cultural roots stretch back to the Peloponnesian war, through several Roman emperors and it was a centre of cultural exchange and creation in the 19th century. In 2006 Patras aims to use culture to drive European integration forward.
The festivities have already kicked off with an exhibition about the original Renaissance man - Leonardo Da Vinci, a concert by Patras's symphony orchestra, and Patras's carnival, which has been the city's flagship event for 170 years. Introducing Patras's programme to the European Parliament's culture committee late last year, Giorgios Panagiotopoulos, Communications Director and spokesman for the project, said Patras "has an important role in the cultural convergence of member stares (and aims to show) every aspect of European cultural heritage."
While the majority of scheduled events fall under the "artistic" heading in the form of exhibitions, concerts and performances, the issue of Europe is centre-stage. Under the title: "What about Europe?" hundreds of politicians, Nobel prize winners, artists, journalists, scientists, publishers, businessmen and representatives of NGOs will gather to discuss the relationship of media, politics and science with culture. The main aim of the project is to question and provide a space to debate these topics, which are central to European culture as a whole.
Europe@Patras
When preparing the event, the organisers realized that for European integration to be a success and the European identity to become a reality we need to understand our differences and accept our cultural diversity. In this context, over the 15-day "Europe@Patras" programme, citizens from across the EU will have the chance to share their personal lifestyles with other people, ranging from what they eat to what music they listen to and how they dress..
The European Capital of Culture scheme was launched in 1985 to bring the citizens of Europe closer, in order to enhance cultural exchange and celebrate cultural diversity. Last year Cork was the cultural capital and in 2007 Luxembourg and Sibiu in Romania will carry the torch.
