MEPs call for free access to EU15 labour markets for new Member States

The Employment Committee is calling for an end to the transitional measures restricting access for workers from eight 'new' Member States to labour markets in several 'old' Member States. Countries with restrictions in place have until 1 May 2006 to decide on whether to lift them or to extend them until 2009.
In an own initiative report by Csaba Ã–ry (EPP-ED, HU), MEPs stress that the free movement of workers is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the EC Treaty, as well as an expression of solidarity between old and new Member States. They say that there are no signs of strain on the labour markets of those Member States which have opened their doors: fears of massive migration have proved groundless and there are beneficial effects for the economies concerned. The committee says the denial of opportunities for new Member State workers to work legally in most of the EU-15 has fuelled illegal work, the black economy and worker exploitation.
MEPs criticise the fact that some long-term residents from non-EU countries are in a more favourable position than citizens of the Member states which joined the EU in 2004. Member States should, they say, also abolish national rules which contradict the so-called 'status quo clause' which states that workers from the new Member States should not face greater restrictions than applied before the accession treaties were signed. They say labour law should be strictly enforced to guarantee all workers in the EU are treated equally.
The report was adopted by 37 votes in favour to 3 against and 4 abstentions.
Background:
In May 2004, labour market restrictions were imposed, as allowed by the accession treaties, on workers from the eight new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe by all the old (EU 15) Member States except Ireland, Sweden and the UK. These arrangements can continue for up to seven years, broken down into three periods (2+3+2 years). Several Member States (Finland, Spain, Portugal) have already announced that they will open up their labour markets to citizens of the new Member States. Others have announced that they will renew the restrictions (Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy and France).
