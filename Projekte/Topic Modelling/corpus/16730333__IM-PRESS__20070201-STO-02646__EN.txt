Bulgaria's President Parvanov asks for open borders
The second day of plenary saw Bulgaria's President Georgi Parvanov make a plea to MEPs to support him in persuading EU members to open their borders to Bulgaria's workers. The day also saw the adoption of reports on obesity and discrimination against young women and girls in education. The House passed a resolution supporting an international moratorium on the death penalty.
President Parvanov used his address to the House to say that "fears of migrant waves" had proved unfounded after the last EU enlargement in 2004. He told MEPs that the lifting of barriers would "bring benefits to Bulgaria and the EU".
On fears over the safety of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria, the President cited recent checks by international experts and restated his countries commitment to nuclear safety.
On the Bulgarian nurses sentences to death in Libya for allegedly infecting 400 children with the AIDS virus, he welcomed the "solidarity shown by the EU" on the issue.
Welcoming him to the Chamber Parliament's President Poettering congratulated Bulgaria on the reforms it had undertaken on the road to EU membership.
Reduce fat, salt to tackle obesity
With the levels of obesity rising dramatically across the European Union - a report passed by MEPs yesterday on the "prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases" was timely. It calls for obesity to be recognised as a chronic disease rather than something which is somehow "self inflicted". MEPs hope a reclassification of it will lead to less discrimination and stigmatisation.
The report suggests a school based approach - it calls on countries to ensure that schools have sufficient funding to provide healthy and nutritional schools meals (burgers and chips are usually cheaper than vegetables and fruit).
The report would also like to see better labelling of food - common labels across the EU would help raise nutritional standards.
The key to reducing obesity is reducing fat, sugar and salt levels in food. In this aim the report calls on EU governments, manufacturers, retailers and caterers to make this their first priority. The rapporteur for the issue was Belgian Liberal MEP Frédérique Ries.
Death to the death penalty
MEPs passed a resolution committing Parliament to support UN efforts for an international moratorium on the death penalty. In particular they called on all EU members to support a resolution on the death penalty in the UN's General Assembly. The resolution also condemned the recent execution of Saddam Hussein, the manner it was carried out and the media's exploitation of the event.
Young women need more educational support
In the EU women make less progress than men in the educational system. A report passed by MEPs yesterday calls on EU members to support young women and girls and put in place national educational policies that can help them achieve their potential.
In particular it identifies young women from religious and ethnic minorities and immigrants as particularly vulnerable.
The report identifies economic and social reasons why young females are not doing as well in education as young males. It also says that prejudice towards women plays a role. Věra Flasarová of the European United Left group acted as the rapporteur.
MEPs meet for their next plenary session on 12 February.
