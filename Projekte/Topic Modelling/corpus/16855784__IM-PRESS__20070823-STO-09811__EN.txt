EP set to focus on IGC, 2008 budget
MEPs look set for a busy autumn. Along with hot topics like the revision of the EU Treaties, there are plenty of bread and butter politics and legislation for MEPs to get their teeth into, including the 2008 budget and the reform of the EU's wine regime. Energy and global warming will be prominent on the EP agenda with the temporary climate change committee, established in April, looking for practical solutions to fight climate change.
In July, MEPs backed the convening of an intergovernmental conference (IGC) to draft a "reform treaty" replacing the draft constitution and nominated three MEPs to take part in the treaty revision.
EP President Hans-Gert Pöttering said the IGC and reform is the EU's central political concern in the coming months. "I am confident that a good text, corresponding to the mandate, will be worked out for the reform treaty under the Portuguese Presidency. It should then be swiftly ratified so that the EU will become more democratic and operational. The EP will be giving its input." Mr Pöttering also said the new
treaty will define our common values in the EU and will be a prerequisite for any future enlargement of the Union.
The IGC was formally opened by Portugal, the current holder of the 6-month rotating EU presidency, on July 23. "It is essential to improve the functioning of the EU through the reform of the Treaties in order to ensure better implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and more efficient external action. This is the way in which we can influence our position in a globalised world," the presidency said.
EU heads of state and government are expected to approve a new draft treaty in October. Member countries will then have to ratify the treaty, but it should be ready for the June 2009 EU elections.
Tough talks ahead on 2008 budget
The 2008 budget is likely to entail a lot of negotiation in the coming months. Since the budget often runs to over 1800 pages and 1500 budget lines, it requires a lot of work to get a timely agreement and those involved worked on it over the summer. The Budget committee has intense negotiations with the Commission and Council ahead and will also have to handle myriad amendments from other committees, political groups and MEPs.
Better regulation and milk on September agenda
MEPs will meet in Strasbourg for autumn's first plenary session from September 3-6. Better regulation - the EU's attempt to cut down red tape - and the revision of rules on milk are on the agenda. Other topics include the budget, the fight against terrorism, sustainable fisheries, the transport of dangerous goods, liquids on board airlines and the possession and purchase of weapons.
