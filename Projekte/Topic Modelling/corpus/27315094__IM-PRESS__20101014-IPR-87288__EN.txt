Tara O'Reilly (student) presenting the case of Aminatou Haidar At an event last week in Galway, Aminatou Haidar was chosen by students from the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland in Galway as their candidate to win this year's European Parliament Sakharov prize. Aminatou Haidar, who is a Sahrawi human rights defender and political activist for the independence of Western Sahara, is one of the nine European Parliament nominees for the 2010 prize.
At the initiative of the European Parliament Office in Ireland, the students from the Irish Centre for Human Rights 'adopted' each of the nine nominees in teams of two. The students then presented the case of 'their' nominee and argued why their chosen nominee should be awarded this year's Sakharov prize. An open debate followed the presentations and the audience on the night then voted in two rounds.
Following the first round of voting, three finalists were selected: Breaking the Silence (an Israeli NGO), Access (a citizen movement focusing on online communication and protection of the freedom to do so) and Aminatou Haidar.
Aminatou Haidar was chosen as the students' winner on the night. The final result was:
Aminatou Haidar - 30 votes
Breaking the Silence - 13 votes
Access - 13 votes
Speaking at the beginning of the event, the President of the National University of Ireland in Galway, Dr James Browne, reminded the students of the example set by Andrei Sakharov, for whom the prize is named. At the conclusion of the event, Dr Noam Lubell of the Irish Centre for Human Rights suggested that the event become an annual one.
The winner of this year's award, as selected by the MEPs, will be presented with the Sakharov Prize by the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek MEP, during the December Plenary Session in Strasbourg.
