Parliament has adopted a report on the EU’s competition policy in 2005, welcoming the Commission’s moves to modernise competition policy, in particular its reinforced stance on targeting cartels and unauthorised state aid, as well as the sectoral enquires launched by Commissioner Neelie Kroes.
The report, drawn up by Elisa Ferreira (PES, PT), welcomes the Commission’s economic rather than rules-based approach, and the efforts to improve the quality of enforcement of decisions. It calls for further progress in reducing differences of interpretation by national courts, and suggests setting up a network of judicial authorities, similar to that already linking competition authorities – the European Competition Network.
Among other points, the report:
repeats Parliament’s call for clarification of the application of competition rules to services of general economic interest;
asserts that certain taxation practices in some Swiss cantons could have the effect of distorting competition and calls on Member States to continue dialogue with Switzerland with a view to it participating in the Code of Conduct for Business Taxation;
expresses concern at the relative failure to achieve genuine competition in energy markets especially in a situation where markets open to new players might facilitate environmental progress; suggests that progress would be welcome in reviewing the “two-thirds rule” which governs whether national or European competition authorities deal with a particular case;
stresses the need to avoid competition and duplication between Member States’ state aid schemes;
notes that EC competition policy should focus on aid practices of third countries which might favour competitors to EU firms in globalised markets, while preferring a cooperative, mutual recognition approach rather than subsidy competition.
