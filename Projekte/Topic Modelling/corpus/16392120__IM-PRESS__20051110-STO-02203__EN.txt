Delegations
2005-11-18 - 14:07
Agriculture is one item on the agenda in Edinburgh
Natural disasters, the situation in West Africa and the role of national parliaments in overseeing development aid are on the agenda next week when Edinburgh plays host to parliamentarians from Europe, Africa, the Caribbean and countries of the Pacific. Better known under its acronym "ACP-EU", they are in the Scottish capital for a meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly that brings together representatives from countries that have signed the Cotonou Trade agreement.
What are they debating? Next week the Assembly will debate a report on ways of increasing the role of national parliaments in overseeing the use of development aid. They will also debate ways of making better use of agricultural and mining resources - particularly in the context of ongoing World Trade Organisation negotiations. The parliamentarians will also hear a report on the "causes and consequences of natural disasters" and debate the political situation in West Africa. They will also adopt resolutions on these subjects. Glenys Kinnock MEP, Co-President of the Assembly said ahead of the meeting that "the conference will be an opportunity for us as parliamentarians...to deliberate on the issues and priorities which we share. This includes...funding for development obligation set by the Millennium Development Goals."
Who are they? The Joint Parliamentary Assembly comprises 77 members of the European Parliament and 77 MPs from Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific countries. They meet twice a year (once in an EU country, once in an ACP country) to discuss issues related to the Cotonou accord. It is the only institution of its kind in the world. The institution is governed by common, democratic rules. The meeting in Edinburgh lasts from 19 to 24 November and is open to the general public.
Benin to Britain: The underlying aim of the Cotonou Agreement (named after the capital of Benin where the accord was singed in 2000) is to fight poverty - principally through increased trade and economic activity. It also covers political, cultural and social cooperation designed to foster "peace and security" between its signatories. Issues related to the agreement will be debated in Edinburgh. This type of relationship between the European Union and ACP states dates back to the 1963 Yaoundé convention and from 1975 to 2000 various Lomé conventions. The number of participants and scope of cooperation has progressively expanded.
