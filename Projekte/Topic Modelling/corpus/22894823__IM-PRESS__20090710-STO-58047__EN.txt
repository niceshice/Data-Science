Swedish PM Ferderik Reinfedt took this route on Wednesday as have the likes of President Sarkozy, Abbas and many world leaders in the past.

Mimi Mollica Covering the "unseen" part of the European Parliament's opening session was the declared ambition of Sicilian born photographer Mimi Mollica. As a participant in the "guest photographer" project he was invited to Strasbourg to cover the Parliament over 13-16 July. His work focuses on social issues, human rights and troubled areas of the world such as India, Pakistan, Africa, Cuba and Brazil.
Now based in London, Mimi told us of his feelings on coming to the Parliament's first session of its 2009-2014 term:
"Strasbourg is known to be the official headquarters of the European Parliament. Here the MEPs get to vote and speak to the press. As a Guest photographer I have been invited to take pictures during the first plenary session of the 2009-2014 legislation, which will have been largely covered by the European press, so I opted to offer a different angle of this reality.
My pictures present the "unseen"
He went on to say my pictures present the "unseen" by the public, a reality existing behind the facade of the political arena. The empty, in-between spaces offer the background to individual figures in resting moments or moving from a place to the other".
Elaborating on this theme he said: "The fine architecture of these buildings reflects the efforts to build an environment consonant with the duties of our deputies. To them, the MEPs, I wish the best for these coming five years in order to improve and work on legislation that is good for us, our future and the growing more pluralistic European society:"
