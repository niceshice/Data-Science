The economic crisis should not stand in the way of combating HIV, it says, noting that over 25,000 new infections were recorded in 2009 and that an estimated that 30% of people with HIV/AIDS are unaware that they carry the virus.
The resolution stresses also the need for affordable access to contraceptives, including access to emergency contraception.
Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek noted that on the 30th anniversary of the discovery of the disease, scientists had unfortunately so far been unable to stop its spread, and that morbidity was rising in countries affected by the economic crisis. He voiced Parliament's sympathy with those living with HIV, and noted that World AIDS day is an occasion to remember those who lost the fight against AIDS.
Midway through a 2009-2013 EU action plan to combat HIV/AIDS, the MEPs ask for country-specific HIV action plans in the EU and effective responses to HIV in neighbouring countries.
