In adopting a written declaration on on "dys"crimination and social exclusion affecting children with "dys"abilities, MEPs ask the Commission and Council to draw up a charter for "dys" children, and to encourage the recognition of "dys"-type problems as a handicap.
The written declaration was sponsored by Marie PANAYOTOPOULOS-CASSIOTOU (EPP-ED, EL) Richard HOWITT (PES, UK), Kathy SINNOTT (IND/DEM, IE), Roberta ANGELILLI (UEN, IT) and Anna ZÁBORSKÁ (EPP-ED, SK) and signed by over half of all MEPs (406 so far), the required number for it to become an official position of the European Parliament.
It is estimated annually that more than 10% of children are affected by one or other "dys"-type disability such as dysphasia, dyspraxia, dyslexia, dyscalculia or attention deficit disorder, etc., and whereas the statistics on these disorders need to be refined
MEP want to promote and encourage the creation of a European multidisciplinary network on specific learning difficulties, and by this means to collect and study information and promote the coordination of cross-border actions, as well as institutional dialogue.
The declaration calls for the sharing of best practice by:
– making information accessible,
– taking timely steps to spot, screen, systematically diagnose and treat these disorders at an early stage,
– designing effective pedagogical structures within both the ordinary and the specialist educational environment for young children, adolescents and young adults,
– adapting structures for integrating young people with these disabilities into the world of work.
The only way to prevent "dys"crimination, say MEP, against affected children is to give them special, early, intensive and multidisciplinary treatment in appropriate structures (either in the normal school environment with appropriate special care, or in a specialised establishment.
