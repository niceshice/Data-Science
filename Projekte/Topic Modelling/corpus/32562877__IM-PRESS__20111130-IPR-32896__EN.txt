The non-binding resolution drafted by Matteo Salvini (EFD, IT) for the Internal Market Committee constitutes Parliament's contribution to a recast of the "Modernised Customs Code" to be initiated by the Commission early next year.
Smart, smooth and simple
MEPs call on Member States to commit fully to the process of modernising customs procedures and especially to the uniform application of EU customs legislation. They urge the European Commission to take all necessary action to ensure a seamless and harmonised application of the EU customs legislation throughout the EU.
However, MEPs also recognise the need to postpone the current June 2013 deadline for the entry into effect of the Modernised Customs Code, due to difficulties with the information technology systems needed to support it. Appropriate funds should therefore be allocated for the development of more advanced systems, say MEPs, mentioning 2016 as a possible new deadline.
Target high-risk consignments
The resolution also stresses that customs controls should primarily target high-risk consignments whereas low-risk consignments should be speedily released for circulation. MEPs note that the current US legislative requirement to scan all containers arriving in the US is overly burdensome and excessively costly, while actual benefits are doubtful. MEPs are determined to pursue dialogue with the US in order to achieve the repeal or amendment of this legislation.
Combat illegal imports to ensure product safety and protect intellectual property rights
MEPs stress the need for strong cooperation among customs administrations, market surveillance authorities and businesses to intercept unsafe or non-compliant products and urge that the fight against smuggling, organised crime, corruption, terrorism and other criminal acts be stepped up.
The resolution underlines that customs are no longer primarily collectors of duties, but key elements in ensuring citizens' safety and EU firms' competitiveness by enforcing intellectual property rights and combating the illegal entry of goods and counterfeit products from third countries into the EU single market. It also notes the recent Commission proposal for a draft regulation concerning customs enforcement of intellectual property rights.
The resolution was adopted by a show of hands.
