A Hill to climb for the climate? MEPs meet US counterparts
MEPs used a three-day official visit to Washington to urge the US to prepare itself for the December 2009 UN summit in Copenhagen. With a new president due to take office in January there are concerns that the US and Europe will not be able to speak with one voice. During the 28-30 April visit, 10 members of the Climate Change Committee talked with members of Congress, members of the Bush Administration and NGO's.
In a statement released on their return, the delegation said: "We cannot expect much movement on climate change from the current White House". Urging the next US president "to do everything in his or her power to overcome every domestic obstacle standing in the way of an international agreement in Copenhagen", MEPs said it would be a major disappointment if the US brings nothing to the table by December 2009.
Hope in Obama, Clinton or McCain?
The delegation, led by Chairman Guido Sacconi (PES) and parliament's rapporteur on climate Karl Heinz Florenz (EPP-ED), said they "expect the next US administration to make climate change a priority – and to begin drafting the relevant domestic legislation – from day one".
"Countries, both developed and developing, will not sign up to an ambitious agreement without the US on board." MEPs asked the US to reflect on "what kind of leverage Europe and America will have over countries like China if we fail to speak with a single voice?"
Call for a workable EU-US carbon trading system
MEPs were pleased to see that Congress is discussing draft legislation on climate change and urged US partners to persist in their effort to establish a carbon trade system "one that, in the near future, could be linked with the EU Emission Trading Scheme", currently under review. Insisting on a link between internal and international climate efforts, they urged the US "to do its utmost to wrap up work on its domestic climate legislation by the December 2009 UN summit in Copenhagen."
Concluding that the meetings on the Hill were "a good start", the delegation called for "far greater, more sustained efforts to coordinate our approaches", adding that it is up to the legislative branch to lead by sending clear policy signals.
