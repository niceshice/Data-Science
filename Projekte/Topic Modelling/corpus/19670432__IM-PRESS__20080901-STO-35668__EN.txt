Parliament is gearing up to host African week Africa week at the European Parliament (8-12 September) will bring the politics and culture of Africa to Brussels. A series of seminars, parliamentary debates, workshops and exhibitions will bring issues that matter to Africans to the forefront of debate. MPs from Africa and around the world will join MEPs to discuss issues such as immigration, the brain drain and the food crisis. The event is being held as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Europe's relations with Africa discussed
The emphasis on African issues will be stressed by parliament's Committees whose agendas will reflect issues of relevance to Europe and Africa. There will also be a session of the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific-European Union (ACP-EU) Parliament Assembly.
The world food crisis will also be discussed this week with the Development Committee debating recent proposals by the European Commission to release an extra €1 billion euros from the Common Agriculture Policy to fund agriculture inputs like seeds and fertilizers. Jacques Diouf - head of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation - will also attend the event on Wednesday.
The same Committee will separately debate the influence that the African Diaspora has had and the role it continues to play in Europe.
The main event will be a joint meeting of Members of the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) and Members of the ACP-EU Joint-parliamentary Assembly, together with Nigerian winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature Wole Soyinka. This will bring the week to a close with parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering and PAP President Gertrude Mongella speaking to delegates.
Art, Elephants, Music
Contemporary Africa's art will be also presented through an array of visual and aural installations, photographs, sculptures, tapestry and videos. On the glass and metal facades of the Parliament projections of works by iconic Mali photographer Malick Sidibé will be displayed
In addition a huge elephant sculpture by the South African sculptor Andries Botha will be displayed at the entrance of the Paul Henri Spaak building during the week.
