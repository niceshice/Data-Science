Traffic that doesn't produce pollution
On Monday MEPs debated planned legislation on air quality and marine pollution aimed at improving quality of life and environmental protection. A proposal to ensure that population and housing data is better collected in the future was also considered by MEPs. Parliament's President Hans-Gert Pöttering welcomed 35 newly elected Romanian MEPs who took their seats after the election in November.
Romanian MEPs welcomed, ETA terrorism condemned
When opening the plenary session, Mr Pöttering condemned the recent murder in France of two Spanish civil guards by ETA. "Terrorism is an attack on freedom and democracy" he said.
As the new Romanian MEPs took their seats, the President welcomed them as "they will be the voice of the Romanian people" until elections in June 2009. Romania held its first European elections on November 25 after joining the EU in January.
"In 50 years there might be no more fish at all."
New laws to protect and conserve Europe's marine life, as part of the move to integrate environmental considerations into all relevant policy areas, were debated by MEPs. EU countries would have until 2020 to take necessary measures to achieve or maintain a good marine environmental status.
French Socialist Marie-Noëlle Lienemann, the parliament's rapporteur on the issue, stressed the importance of taking action to protect biodiversity in the seas and oceans. Otherwise "in 50 years there might be no more fish at all," she said. Ms Lienemann urged EU countries to work faster than the requirements laid down in the legislation so as "not to lose time because our seas can not wait."
Air quality - new limits and binding targets
Breathing difficulties and illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema may be affected by the amount of "particulate matter" (PM) in the air we breathe. In an agreement reached by Ministers and MEPs, binding targets to reduce the amount of dust in the air have been agreed.
