Parliament has adopted a package of compromise amendments to the report of Gyula HEGYi (ESP, HU) to avoid a second reading on film heritage and the competitiveness of related industrial activities. The recommendation aims at encouraging Member States to preserve European film heritage as an essential component of European cultural and art heritage as well as an element of competitiveness.
Appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that audiovisual heritage is systematically collected, catalogued (deposited), preserved and made accessible to the public.
The rapporteur was very happy with the debate as the Council has accepted his and the Parliament's main requirements. Thus the deposit of films will be mandatory by legal or contractual or other means (the Member States may choose between the two systems) so that a systematic collection is secured throughout Europe. In order to make common film heritage as comprehensive as possible it is stipulated that after a transitional period of two years every film should, when possible, be deposited and not only those that receive public funding. In order to know what collection each Member State has, the Parliament proposes a network of databases where already existing Council of Europe institutions such as the European Observatory in Strasbourg can play an important role.
Last but not least, the use of the film heritage as a way of strengthening the European dimension in education and promoting cultural diversity should also be stressed in the recommendation, as well as fostering and promoting visual education, film studies and media literacy in education at all levels, professional training programmes and European programmes. MEPs also insisted on the use of digital and new technologies in the collection, cataloguing, preservation, restoration of cinematographic works.
