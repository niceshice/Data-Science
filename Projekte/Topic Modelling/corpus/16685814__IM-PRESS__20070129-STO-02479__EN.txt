European football under the floodlights

Football - a game enjoyed on every continent on the world but whose wealthiest clubs are to be found in Europe. At all levels of the game there is a certain tension between the sporting and business aspects of the game. These tensions become more apparent the larger and more profitable the football club. This week in Parliament MEPs will consider two reports that deal with the legal regulation and security aspects of the game.
The infusion of huge amounts of money into clubs, players and agents has led inevitably to some public scandal and debate. Allegations of bribes and match fixing has brought some of the most famous clubs in the sport into disrepute.
TV revenue a key area
A key source of revenue is the TV rights, both nationally and internationally. How the large clubs divide the money and how much they receive is one of the most pressing questions football faces. The lucrative UEFA "Champions League" generates large TV, sponsorship and ticket revenue for clubs involved. In turn this increases their advantage over smaller domestic rivals.
For years the spectre of a break-away European "super-league" of the continents biggest clubs has been a real possibility. The existence of the "G14" - a lobby group of 18 large clubs has only added to speculation over their intentions.
The smaller football clubs feel that present arrangements suit the larger clubs but a report currently being considered by MEPs calls for "fairer distribution" of revenue.
"Football is a game before a product"
How the football calendar is decided and who holds the legal rights to the matches (clubs or national associations) are just some of the issues that the Parliament's rapporteur Ivo Belet would like to see clarified. His report on these and other aspects of the game is being considered by the Culture Committee this week. It will be voted on by the full Parliament in March in its Plenary session.
Also this week a report on "security in football" by Italian MEP Giusto Catania will be considered by Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee. A European Commission White Paper on sport is also expected out later this year.
The election of French football legend Michel Platini as President of UEFA - Europe's governing body - has brought these questions to a head. When elected he said that "football is a game before a product" and has pledged to defend it against overwhelming domination by business. He also called for "Europe's political authorities...to provide sport with a protective legal framework".
Platini would also like fairer distribution of Champions League places to allow teams from Eastern Europe greater access.
"Social significance of sport" recognised
In 1995 the famous "Bosman ruling" by the European Court of Justice made it much easier for foreign players to play around Europe. Two years after that the Treaty of Amsterdam recognised the "social significant of sport".
In any football dispute it is the referee who ultimately decides, British MEP and referee Christopher Heaton-Harris says that all levels of the game be considered: "it is absolutely essential that we, as politicians, do not only concentrate on the top level of football. Football is a social and cultural phenomenon, and remains a huge part of many local communities throughout Europe".
This is the first in a series of forthcoming articles looking at football in Europe - the economic impact of the sport, the distribution of TV rights and a look at young footballers.
