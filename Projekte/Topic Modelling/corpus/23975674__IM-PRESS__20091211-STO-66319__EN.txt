Financing microfinance: MEP Kinga Göncz explains
Economic and monetary union
2009-12-14 - 10:11
Kinga Göncz is hopeful that €500 million may be available to business from public and private means The European microfinance programme is meant to help vulnerable groups and unemployed people to start up their own business to help with the recovery from the crisis. If Parliament agrees, the money could start flowing early in 2010. The Employment Committee wants separate funding, unlike the Commission, which is proposing using money taken from another vital EU help scheme. We spoke to her Hungarian Socialist Kinga Göncz about her report which will be debated by Parliament (14 December).
What is the microfinance program and why it is so important now?
We hear that the economic crisis is over, but, according to most politicians and experts, the social consequences of the crisis are far from over and unemployment is growing all over Europe.
The microfinance facility is a new instrument to support vulnerable groups that are particularly hard hit by this crisis. These are people who are at risk of losing their jobs, or, if they are already unemployed, are likely to face difficulties in getting back into the labour market. On top of this, they are cut off from traditional credit because banks consider them too risky and cost intensive.
Helping them start up their own businesses is one way to help the recovery. It creates new opportunities and can help compensate them for the limited possibilities in the traditional employment market.
Beneficiaries will also receive training and assistance in developing viable and sustainable businesses. I hope the initial funding could as much as €500 million from public and private means.
What is the EP's line?
My report on the Microfinance facility (adopted by the Employment Committee in November) goes further than the original Commission proposal in terms of financing and in terms of assisting the target groups in getting mentoring and training courses.
The Commission proposed to reallocate €100 million from the Progress budget (this programme supports coordination of member state policies in the field of employment, non-discrimination and social inclusion). The Employment Committee wants a separate budget line. I'm convinced that reallocating all the money from Progress would give the wrong signal since it targets the most vulnerable groups. Moreover I'm convinced that €100 million for four years is the minimum amount to start with in order to be effective and attract other resources.
What do you expect from the debate on Monday?
I hope Parliament will adopt my report on the Microfinance Facility and provide the necessary financial means for the first year of programming. That would allow the programme to start in early 2010. Now the ball is in the Council's court.
