Swedish PM and EU presidency holder Fredrik Reinfeldt: "People say it's the most difficult presidency ever". Strasbourg, 15 July Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, who currently holds the EU presidency, spoke exclusively to us on Wednesday ahead of his speech to MEPs. The 43 year old leader of the Moderate Party will need all his renowned calm to coordinate the EU's response to the economic crisis and lead the way to a new global climate change deal by December. Since September 2006 he has headed Sweden's centre right government that continues to enjoy considerable popularity.
You have to deal with the economic crisis, the Irish referendum on the Lisbon treaty...and save the world from climate change catastrophe. Is this the most difficult EU Presidency ever?
People say it's the most difficult presidency ever, so our slogan is "taking on the challenge", notably of the economic recession and climate agreement needed in Copenhagen at the same time. And with the treaty discussions on top of that, there will be a lot to do.
But I think and hope we will be seen as well prepared. We also need good cooperation with the Parliament. Now that they have elected their group leaders and are getting down to work, we will cooperate well and succeed in the end.
About the new Parliament, the fact that 50% of the Members are new and there are many eurosceptical members, will it be difficult to work with them?
No I don't think so. My experience is that it's a Parliament that takes responsibilty and has always seen that the European interest is at the heart of European democracy. I've always a good understanding of the negotiations and discussions with the Parliament.
We've seen in national elections also that more and more Parliamentarians seem to rotate. Partly that could be seen as something good. New members come with fresh ideas and views that are hopefully very close to their voters - and I think that is for the best for European voters.
Can we ask about the Barroso issue (MEPs must vote on a new European Commission President), should the Parliament have voted on his nomination in your view or should the Parliament wait?
Well I have respect for the autonomous standing of the European Parliament - my interest is to see that we have a fully functioning leadership in Europe at this very tough time. That means a well prepared presidency, but I also know that I need a Commission President with a full mandate.
If we have leadership questions then Europe turns inwards looking. Once solved, we can take on leadership that is outward looking. But I am very pleased with the situation where EU-governments have now taken a formal position on the nomination and then it's up to the Parliament to say yes or no.
I hear signals that they might be able to do that in September, in that case I would welcome it and in that case we are up and running and that is best for Europeans.
A final and if I may a personal question, Swedish authors are very much in the news at the moment, people like Stieg Larsson . Who would be your favourite Swedish author?
Well I must say Astrid Lindgren. She has been a storyteller for many generations of Swedes. She's the storyteller I grew up with and she's the one I read to my children. I would say a lot of our images of Sweden going back in history come from her stories, so she is very influential in the way she tells her stories. She's probably the one I would turn to.
