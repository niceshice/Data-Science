Swedish Presidency/Conference of Presidents. The outgoing President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, will be joined by leaders of the political groups in Stockholm for a meeting with the Swedish government as Sweden takes on the presidency of the Council (Monday).
Preparing for the plenary. The political groups will finalise their preparations for the 14-16 July inaugural plenary session of the 7th directly elected European Parliament.
