Briefing - 15-18 January 2007 - Strasbourg
2007-01-11 - 09:07
Institutional change takes centre-stage at Parliament's first plenary session of 2007. President Josep Borrell is standing down at the end of his two-and-a-half-year term of office, so MEPs will be electing a new President , as well 14 Vice-Presidents . With the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU at the start of this year, the number of MEPs increases from 732 to 785 . A new political group is expected to be set up. Parliament will also have the chance to debate with German Chancellor Angela Merkel the work programme of her country's six-month presidency of the EU, which began on 1 January.
On the legislative front, the third rail package comes up for second reading and MEPs will also respond to the Commission's latest road safety proposals. In addition, Parliament will give its view on the operation of the EU's code of conduct on arms exports.
Monday 15 January
At the start of the session, outgoing President Josep Borrell will formally welcome the 35 new Members from Romania and the 18 from Bulgaria, who take up their seats following the accession of their countries on 1 January. The arrival of the new intake of MEPs is providing an opportunity for the set up of a new political group .
Mr Borrell will then give his farewell speech to the House as he completes his term of office, which began in July 2004 following the European elections of that year.
Tuesday 16 January
Nominations of candidates to replace Mr Borrell as President must be put forward by Monday evening. At the time of writing four candidates have been proposed. The election takes place on Tuesday and is followed by the election of the 14 Vice-Presidents and six Quaestors.
Wednesday 17 January
The House holds a keynote debate on Wednesday morning with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Commission President José Manuel Barroso on Germany's six-month presidency of the EU . The main issues are constitutional reform, the Lisbon economic agenda and the EU's area of freedom, security and justice.
On Wednesday afternoon, MEPs will discuss with Commission and Council the case of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff facing a death sentence in Libya , before adopting a resolution on the issue. They will then debate a report calling for tougher implementation of the EU's code of conduct on arms exports , before turning to the main legislative item on this week's agenda, the third rail package . This latest effort to inject more competition into Europe's rail networks focuses on passenger services but, given the sticking points between Parliament and Council, it looks as if conciliation will be needed.
Other reports on Wednesday look at the Commission's mid-term review of the EU's road safety action programme and the request for Parliament's assent to an updated partnership agreement with the developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific . Towards the end of the day proposed changes to the membership of Parliament's committees will be announced ( vote Thursday ). New chairs and vice-chairs of the committees will be elected at the committee meetings the following week.
Thursday 18 January
A report on equality between men and women in the work of the EP's committees is the first item on Thursday's agenda. Another report, on the law on non-contractual obligations , deals with a range of topics to do with disputes between EU citizens from different Member States, such as traffic accidents.

Welcome of Bulgarian and Romanian MEPs - Changes in composition of Parliament
2007-01-11 - 09:07
At 6pm on Monday 15 January, Parliament will formally welcome the new Members of the European Parliament from Bulgaria and Romania. The 35 Romanians and 18 Bulgarians who became MEPs on 1 January 2007 as their countries joined the European Union have been appointed by their respective national parliaments and will serve until elections to the European Parliament are held in the two countries later in 2007.
Since 26 September 2005, the same number of observers from each country had been sitting at the European Parliament. In many cases, the same people have been re-appointed as full Members. The full list of the new MEPs for each country is available via the links below.
The total number of Members of the European Parliament now rises from 732 to 785. With this increase, the figure needed for a qualified majority now becomes 393 votes (for the adoption of second-reading amendments in co-decision, for example).
After the next European elections in 2009, the figure of 785 will again fall, this time to 736, of which 33 will be from Romania and 17 from Bulgaria.
At the time of publication, a procedure for the creation of a new political group has been set in motion. It would be called Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty (ITS), would be led by Bruno Gollnisch (NA, FR) and have Members from France, Romania, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Austria, Italy and Bulgaria.
Parliament's Rules of Procedure state "a political group shall comprise Members elected in at least one-fifth of the Member States. The minimum number of Members required to form a political group shall be twenty." One fifth of the Member States in this case would mean MEPs from six different Member States. If all the requirements are fulfilled, the constitution of the new group will be announced at Monday's sitting. 6pm, 15.01.2005 List of MEPs from Romania List of MEPs from Bulgaria Rules of Procedure on the formation of political groups

Speech by outgoing President Borrell
2007-01-11 - 09:07
Following the formal welcome of the Romanian and Bulgarian MEPs, outgoing President Josep Borrell Fontelles will make his last speech as President of the European Parliament. Mr Borrell was elected in July 2004 for a two and a half year term. President Borrell said the biggest challenge during his mandate was: "The move from a Parliament of 15 members to a Parliament of 25, and now 27. Apart this "internal' challenge, the EP faced big legislative topics: the Services directive and the chemicals regulation REACH.
We also have worked a lot together with the national parliaments, and I believe we have overcome certain distrust. With the other two main European institutions Parliament has established better relations, in spite of the difficult start with the Commission. As for relations with the media he said: "I would like to be remembered for the breakthrough in communication. "I believe that the European Parliament has made a qualitative leap in its capacity to be heard and seen in the media. After the refusal to confirm Mr Butiglione as Commissioner, the services directive, the demonstrations in front of the Parliament when we were deciding on the port services directive…our work is starting to be known. The other institutions take us into account, but the public also knows that we are more than just the proverbial Tower of Babel." 6pm, 15.01.2007 President's homepage

Constituent session - election of new President, Vice Presidents and Quaestors
2007-01-11 - 09:07
On Tuesday 16 January, MEPs will elect a new President of Parliament, together with 14 Vice-Presidents. All of these officers will serve a two and a half year term up to the next European elections in June 2009. At the beginning of Tuesday’s sitting, the chair will be taken by the oldest member, in this case Giovanni Berlinguer (PES, IT), born on 9 July 1924, who will chair proceedings until a new President has been elected. Nomination of candidates for the presidency and election procedure
Candidates for the presidency may be proposed either by a political group or by a minimum of forty MEPs (Rule 12). All the duly nominated candidates will address MEPs before voting begins. The election is held by secret ballot. Unusually for a vote in the European Parliament, MEPs take part by marking their preferred candidate on a paper ballot and placing it in a ballot box. The process is overseen by eight tellers, chosen by lot from among the MEPs.
To be elected, a candidate must win an absolute majority of the valid votes cast, i.e. 50 per cent plus one (Rule 13). Blank or spoiled ballots do not count in calculating the majority required.
If no candidate is elected at the first ballot, the same or other candidates can be nominated for a second round of voting under the same conditions. This can be repeated at a third round if necessary, again with the same rules.
If no-one is elected at the third ballot, the two highest scoring candidates in that round proceed to a fourth ballot, where the one receiving the greater number of votes wins. (Should there be a tie at this stage, the older candidate is declared the winner).
The newly elected President then takes the chair and is entitled to make an opening address (though he or she can also choose to make just a few short remarks, with a more formal speech at a later date), before presiding over the election of the Vice-Presidents and Quaestors.
Role of President, Vice-Presidents
The role of the President is to direct all Parliament's activities in accordance with its Rules of Procedure. In his or her absence one of the Vice-Presidents takes over the duties. The President and the Vice-Presidents sit in the Bureau, which has broad duties relating to financial, organisational and administrative matters.
Candidates for the post of President announced so far are Jens-Peter Bonde (IND/DEM, DK), Monica Frassoni (Greens/EFA, IT), Hans-Gert Poettering (EPP-ED, DE) and Francis Wurtz (EUL/NGL, FR). Further candidates may be put forward up to Monday 6pm. All candidates will have the opportunity to make a five-minute speech to the House just before the first round of voting.
Short biographies of the four declared candidates for President (in alphabetical order by surname)
Jens-Peter Bonde of Denmark, an MEP since 1979, has been leader of the Independence/Democracy Group since its foundation in 2004, having previously led the Europe of Democracies and Diversities Group (1999-2004) and the EDN Group. A former chair of the EP Delegation for relations with Iceland (1992-94), Mr Bonde currently sits on the Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and the European Economic Area. He was a co-founder of the Danish People's Movement against the EC (1972) and the June Movement in 1992.
Monica Frassoni of Italy, has been co-chair of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance since 2002. After working for the Green Group in the EP, for the Young European Federalists and for the Europe Coordinating Bureau of youth NGOs, she was elected to the European Parliament in 1999 for the Belgian Greens (Ecolo) and then in 2004 for the Italian Greens. Ms Frassoni is currently a member of the EP Legal Affairs Committee and the Delegation for relations with Mercosur.
Hans-Gert Poettering of Germany, has been an MEP since 1979 and leader of the EPP-ED Group since 1999. He studied law, politics and history and is a former university lecturer. Mr Poettering has long been active in European affairs for the German CDU and has been on the party's Executive Committee since 1999. A former chair of the EP Subcommittee on Security and Defence (1992-1994) he now sits on the Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Delegation for relations with the countries of Southeast Asia and ASEAN.
Francis Wurtz of France has been chair of the EUL/NGL group since 1999, before which he was vice-chair of the EP Development Committee (1989-1999). A state school teacher from 1969 to 1973, he was from 1979 a member of the central committee of the French Communist Party, from 1990 a member of the national bureau and then head of the party's international department (1992-1999). Mr Wurtz is currently a member of the EP Foreign Affairs Committee and the Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
Election of Quaestors
The six Quaestors (increased from five previously) will be elected by secret ballot following the same election procedure as that for the Vice-Presidents. There will be a maximum of three ballots. The Quaestors look after the interests of MEPs and report to the Bureau and their term of office is two and a half years.

Council statement - programme of the German presidency
2007-01-11 - 09:07
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will appear before the House to outline the main goals of her country's six-month presidency of the European Union. Commission President José Manuel Barroso will also take part. For the first time an 18-month programme has been drafted for three successive presidencies (the German, Portuguese and Slovenian) covering the period January 2007 to June 2008, with the aim of improving continuity in the Council's work. The programme was drawn up in conjunction with the European Commission and was adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 December 2006.
The future of the EU's constitutional reforms, a fresh drive on the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs and further progress in the area of freedom, security and justice are the key topics on the agenda. There will also be more emphasis on cooperation on the EU's joint foreign-policy activities, such as foreign and security policy, trade relations and worldwide economic and development cooperation.
A highlight of the Germany presidency will be the commemoration in March 2007 at a ceremony in Berlin of the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome. At this ceremony the EU Heads of State or Government, the President of the Commission and the President of the European Parliament will issue a joint declaration reaffirming the EU's values and ambitions and confirming their commitment to dealing with the challenges facing Europe.

Law applicable to non-contractual obligations
2007-01-11 - 09:07
Diana WALLIS (ALDE, UK) for the Legal Affairs Committee will be tabling a legislative resolution on Rome II the law applicable to non-contractual obligations. MEPs in the committee are putting forward a number of amendments that reintroduce the provisions related to violations of privacy, including defamation, previously deleted in the Council's Common Position. The so-called "Rome II" Regulation aims to facilitate litigations between citizens from different European countries on matters such as traffic accidents, accidents caused by defective products and violation of the environment. As a general rule, the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of a tort is the law of the country in which the damage occurs, irrespective of the country in which the event giving rise to the damage took place. Traffic accidents represent the majority of cross-border disputes involving EU citizens.
MEPs in the committee simplify the Commission's proposal by extending the number of subjects regulated by the general rule. In fact, the committee proposes deleting the special provisions included in the Commission's proposal on unfair competition and environmental damage. Moreover, MEPs in the committee recommend that in case of personal injury, for instance caused by a car accident, the court should apply the law of the victim's country when evaluating the scale of the damage. This provision takes into account the fact that citizens are not aware of other countries' legislation.
At first reading, MEPs had approved a compromise amendment that regulated the violation of privacy by a printed or audiovisual media. The Council decided to delete this provision from its Common Position. The report reintroduces the same rules as adopted at the first reading. According to the proposed report, the law applicable, in case of defamation by media, should be the one of the country to which the publication or broadcasting service is principally directed or, if this is not apparent, the country in which editorial control is exercised.
Finally, MEPs in the committee ask the Commission to present a report on the application of the Regulation two years after the entry into force. This report should especially focus on traffic accidents and provide a study on the extent to which courts apply foreign law. Non-contractual obligations arising out of family relationships, matrimonial property regimes and succession are excluded from the Regulation's scope.

Call for tougher rules on arms trade
2007-01-11 - 09:07
The Foreign Affairs Committee will be asking the plenary to approve an own-initiative report calling for a more robust implementation of the EU's Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and demanding stronger EU support for an international Arms Trade Treaty. The EU Code of Conduct on Arms Export adopted in 1998 is a political agreement designed to set common standards across the EU for the export of military equipment. Under the code, all EU Member States have agreed to apply standard criteria to assess applications for export licences for military equipment. The implementation of the Code is assessed through an Annual Report, published in the autumn of each year.
The Foreign Affairs Committee's report, by Raül Romeva (Greens/EFA, ES), "welcomes the Council's Seventh and Eighth Annual Reports" but "finds it unacceptable that no steps have been taken to adopt the Code as a Common Position" (which would be legally binding).
Seeking to extend the scope of the Code, the report "calls for the EU to consider [...] steps to extend the 1998 EU Code of Conduct so that it covers private security companies," and "calls on the Council and the Commission to include in their further negotiations concerning developments in relation to the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements the question of adherence to all EU embargoes on trade in arms."
Vigilance needed regarding arms importing countries
It also urges Member States "to keep under constant review the human rights situation in arms importing countries," and to "agree on a list of countries involved in armed conflicts to which arms exports should be banned in principle."
Specifically, the committee "considers that the embargo imposed on China should not be lifted until there is a clear and lasting improvement in the situation regarding human rights and social and political freedoms." The report also expresses "deep concern at the blatant violation of the arms embargo by all parties to the Darfur conflict."
Finally, the committee conveys its support for more international legislation in this area, by calling "on the EU Presidency and Member States to match their declaratory diplomacy in favour of an international Arms Trade Treaty with assertive and determined action [...] to establish an effective, legally binding international Arms Trade Treaty laying down minimum global standards for arms transfers."

Third rail package: call for competition on domestic networks from 2017
2007-01-11 - 09:07
The House will vote at second reading on the "third rail package" - three reports which were adopted by the Transport Committee by overwhelming majorities in December. Given the EP's differences with the Council, this legislation is expected to go to conciliation. At its vote on the first report, on the development of the Community's railways, the Transport Committee declared strongly in favour of more competition on international and national railway networks. This report was drafted by Georg Jarzembowski (EPP-ED, DE) and adopted in committee by 30 votes to 10, with 5 abstentions.
In that vote, the committee called for international passenger services to be opened up to competition by 1 January 2010 and domestic passenger services by 2017. A derogation is envisaged for Member States which joined the EU on or after 1 May 2004. These would have the right to postpone competition in domestic services by up to five years.
Parliament's first reading position had called for international passenger services to be opened up by 2008 but the Transport Committee is now proposing that, for that category, Parliament accept the date of 2010 contained in the Council's common position. However, the Council is opposed to opening up the market for domestic rail services at all, so conciliation is likely to be needed on this point.
Minimum rights for all railway passengers
In a report by Dirk Sterckx (ALDE, BE) on minimum rights for rail passengers, the committee voted by 44 to 1, with no abstentions, to extend proposals on international passengers' rights and obligations to domestic rail traffic, arguing that "ordinary rail passengers should not be left out in the cold". This demand conflicts with the Council's position. Sterckx said that there was no point in drawing up a regulation which applied only to the 5% rail passengers who use international train services. European citizens should, in the event of problems, be entitled to certain minimum rights.
The matters regulated by this proposal include information for passengers, liability in the event of death or injury and assistance to persons with reduced mobility. The committee is also in favour of a system of compensation for delays: 25% of the fare for a delay of 60 minutes or more and 50% for a delay of 120 minutes or more, but only if the operator can be held responsible for the delay. Furthermore, rail operators must ensure that stations, platforms and means of transport are accessible, by eliminating all obstacles to boarding, disembarkation and remaining on board. And in future all trains should provide a specially designated area of the train for baby carriages, bicycles and sports equipment.
Towards a European licence for train drivers
A report on certification of train drivers, drafted by Gilles Savary (PES, FR), was adopted unanimously in committee. Whereas the Council wishes only train drivers to be covered by the directive, the Transport Committee feels that other crew members performing safety-related tasks should be in possession of a certificate attesting that they meet minimum requirements relating to medical fitness, basic education and general professional skills.

Road safety: more action needed
2007-01-11 - 09:07
In a report produced in response to the Commission's mid-term review of the EU Road Safety Action Programme, the Transport Committee is calling for "a higher level of political commitment" to road safety in all Member States and EU institutions. More than 40,000 deaths are caused by road traffic accidents in the European Union, the direct and indirect costs of which are estimated at €180 billion, or 2% of EU GDP. Moreover, the disparity between different Member States' road safety records is widening.
The Transport Committee's report, drawn up by Ewa Hedkvist Petersen (PES, SE), voices disappointment at the lack of progress in reaching the target of halving the number of road fatalities in the EU by 2010. It urges Member States to enforce existing legislation, which MEPs say would greatly improve road safety if it were fully observed by road users.
The committee makes a number of other recommendations:
- an EU-wide zero alcohol limit should be introduced for new drivers as well as for bus drivers and professional commercial drivers involved in the transport of hazardous goods;
- the Commission should conduct a study on harmonising road signs and rules in Europe to reduce unnecessary risks; at present, for example, differing priority rules at roundabouts can cause accidents;
- the Commission should consider creating a common minimum standard for driving instructors with test and certification;
- given the large number of accidents and deaths at road work zones, common guidelines should be devised for such areas;
- Member States should make hands-free mobile telephone systems compulsory for car, bus and commercial drivers;
- Member States should step up their efforts to increase the use of seat belts in all vehicles, especially buses;
- the Commission should launch a European-wide information campaign advocating breaks in driving every two hours to combat tiredness in drivers;
- the Commission should impose a general ban on overtaking for vehicles weighing more than 12 tonnes on one- and two-lane roads;
- more attention should be devoted to promoting technologies such as seat belt reminders and advanced restraint systems; Electronic Stability Control; speed limitation systems; alcohol interlocks; predictive safety systems and the eCall system, which could reduce accident response times considerably;
- legislation is needed on cross-border enforcement of penalties for driving offences (so that these are punished even if committed outside the offender's home country), daytime-running lights, the use of rear reflector strips to indicate the outlines of lorries and the use of installed and retro-fitted blind-spot mirrors;
- the Commission and Member States should promote "awareness of the single European emergency call number 112". Rapporteur Ewa HEDKVIST PETERSEN SE A6-0449/2006 European Road Safety Action Programme - Mid-Term Review Procedure : own initiative

2007-01-11 - 09:07
Pervenche BERÈS (PES, FR), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, will be asking the Commission the following questions on further convergence in supervisory practices at EU level: During the ECOFIN Council held in Helsinki in September, the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) reported back on the results of the simulated crisis management exercise which took place in April, on the basis of a memorandum of understanding adopted in May 2005. The outcome of this exercise has clearly indicated that better coordination is needed between the relevant supervisory institutions involved in order to guarantee proper management and hence financial stability. Another exercise of the same kind is already scheduled for 2009 but in the meantime, the EFC is required to draft a report by autumn 2007 about the question of sharing responsibilities between the authorities and the countries concerned. The European Parliament welcomes these initiatives and approves the overall approach.
In the context of the current dynamic changes in the market and in particular the increase of alternative investment vehicles, the stakeholders are loudly calling for stronger measures. The European Parliament is also very concerned about this urgent question and has always been calling for an increased convergence of national supervisory practices, for example in the Muscat report adopted in July 2006 where it proposed to set up a committee of wise persons, to start a reflection on the implications of the consolidation of markets and financial institutions, prudential supervision, financial stability and crisis management.
What is the Commission intending to undertake in this area in order to respond to the needs identified in the crisis-management exercise and to shape the future of European financial supervision? Is the Commission ready to respond to the appeals of the stakeholders and invite the EP and Council to discuss together further steps ? Pervenche BERÈS PES FR Oral question to the Commission

Development and cooperation
Assent to ACP-EU partnership agreement
2007-01-11 - 09:07
José RIBEIRO E CASTRO (EPP-ED, PT), for the Development Committee, will be recommending that Parliament gives its assent to conclusion of the agreement amending the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000. The revised Agreement provides for a more systematic and formal political dialogue under Article 8 when this relates to the three essential elements (human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law). Furthermore, this dialogue must now be held before the consultation procedure provided for by Article 96 can be launched. These provisions are complemented by a new annex setting out the detailed arrangements for this structured dialogue. In keeping with the preventive nature of the dialogue within the meaning of Article 8, a formal and structured dialogue should be held systematically with each country. If, at the end of this formal dialogue, one party considers that the other has failed to respect an essential obligation, it can invoke the consultation procedure and, if necessary, the appropriate measures provided for under Article 96. The timeframes for consultations under Articles 96 and 97 have been extended. The Joint Council may lay down a certain number of additional arrangements, relating, for instance, to the stages of the consultation process and types of benchmarks and targets.
In addition, under the revised Cotonou Agreement, the representatives of the ACP Group and the ACP-EU JPA may participate in the political dialogue provided for in Article 8. In practical terms, this means, for the ACP Group, the troika of the ACP Committee of Ambassadors and the chairperson of the ACP sub-committee on political, social, humanitarian and cultural affairs and, for the JPA, the co-presidents or their designated representatives.
Strengthening of the parliaments (Article 58(2))
For the first time, express reference is made to national parliaments as aid recipients. What is now provided for was already possible in the past, but is sure to encourage the governments of the ACP countries to involve parliaments more systematically in their negotiations on national strategy documents.
The reference to the International Criminal Court (Preamble and Article 6)
This is another completely new element in the Agreement. The partner states asserted their support for the ICC, but discussions on this issue were difficult. The ACP States were broadly in favour of the ICC, with some of them having been a driving force behind it. At the same time, pressure was exerted on them by the United States, which threatened retaliatory action against those countries who signed the Rome Statute. This issue was the subject of much debate at the discussions between the President of the ICC, Mr Philippe Kirsch, and the ACP-EU JPA in The Hague on 23 November 2004. President Kirsch's intervention was without doubt decisive, at a critical juncture in the negotiations, in winning the support of the ACP representatives.
Cooperation in countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) (Article 11b)
This is doubtless one of the most politically important amendments to the Agreement and was the subject of fierce negotiations. It provides for (1) a statement that additional financial and technical assistance will be granted for cooperation on the non-proliferation of WMD and that this will not be funded from resources intended for ACP-EU development cooperation; (2) a statement specifying that the timetable for such measures will be tailored to the specific circumstances in each country; and (3) a provision whereby compliance with non-proliferation measures must be assessed, in particular, on the basis of reports produced by the relevant multilateral institutions.
Countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction will henceforth be an essential element of the partnership, alongside human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.
The ACP countries were reluctant to include this point in the amended agreement as, in their view, this was what had triggered the war in Iraq even though, subsequently, the existence of weapons of mass destruction in that country had not been proved(1). Another problem, expressed less openly by the ACP countries, was that of the structural weakness of some ACP States and the fact they are unable to exercise de facto control over all their territory. Agreement was eventually reached on a wording satisfactory to both parties, not least because provision is made therein for additional support for technical assistance.

Women's rights/Equal opportunities
Equality between men and women in the work of committees
2007-01-11 - 09:07
Anna ZÁBORSKÁ (EPP-ED, SK), for the Women's Rights Committee, will be tabling an own-initiative report on equality between men and women in the committees' work. The committee stresses that the calls for gender equality must be translated into a practical approach which does not set women against men. The report also stresses that gender mainstreaming will lead to positive developments for both women and men; MEPs in the committee point out that gender mainstreaming involves the (re)organisation, improvement, development and evaluation of policy processes, so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated into all policies at all levels and at all stages by the actors normally involved in policy-making.
Future of the implementation of gender mainstreaming
The committee stresses the importance of employing specific terminology and definitions which comply with international standards when using terms relating to gender mainstreaming. The report also stresses the need for the parliamentary committees to be provided with appropriate tools to gain a sound understanding of gender mainstreaming, such as indicators, data and statistics broken down by gender, and the allocation of budgetary resources from a gender equality viewpoint, and to be encouraged to take advantage of in-house expertise (secretariat of the relevant committee, policy department, library, etc.) and external expertise in other local, regional, national and supranational institutions, be they public or private, in small, medium-sized and large companies and in universities working in the area of gender equality;
MEPs in the committee stress that the implementation of gender mainstreaming should take account of the specific features of each parliamentary committee. They call for the assessments to be carried out every two years under the auspices of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality including any shortcomings in the work of the committees and delegations as well as the progress made in implementing gender mainstreaming in each committee.
