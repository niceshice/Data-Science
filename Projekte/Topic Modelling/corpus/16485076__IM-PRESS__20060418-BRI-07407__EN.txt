Briefing : Brussels - 26-27 April 2006
2006-04-21 - 11:28
The Brussels mini-session starts at 2.30pm on Wednesday with a debate on " Twenty years after Chernobyl : Lessons for the future ". MEPs then turn their attention to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU. The European Commission has still to announce whether they consider that the two countries can join the EU on 1 January 2007 as scheduled. Parliament will debate and vote on the discharge of the EU budget for 2004. The Budgetary Control Committee is insisting on better management of Community funds where these are jointly managed by the Commission and the Member States but is nevertheless recommending that the Commission be granted the 2004 budget discharge . MEPs are nevertheless expected to grant discharge to all the EU institutions, organs and agencies.
The House then turns its attention to the issue of language learning with an own initiative report on how to improve and measure language learning in the EU. Parliament will also debate two own-initiative reports from the Economics Committee on asset management and on State aids for innovation.
The session starts at 8.30am on Thursday with a debate on new technology to improve road safety. Gary TITLEY (PES, UK) will be putting forward an own-initiative report on eCall technology . eCall promises to accelerate road-accident response time, reduce the severity of road accidents and therefore contribute "to the objective of reducing road deaths in the EU. It involves an eCall device fitted in road vehicles which is activated in the case of an accident, transmitting "an emergency call with data that goes directly to the nearest emergency call centre" thereby providing information on the location of the accident. "
The House will also debate the financing of trans-European transport networks . MEPs point out that the Council proposed an amount in the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 of only €6 billion – less than one third of the amount proposed by Parliament. MEPs in the Transport Committee say that the Council proposal is clearly not enough, even for the cross-border sections of key priority projects. At least €8.175 billion is required for these sections and related infrastructure. In addition, a further €4 billion is needed in the short term for other vital aspects of priority projects as they become more mature.

Twenty years after Chernobyl: Lessons for the future
2006-04-21 - 11:28
MEPs will have a debate on "Twenty years after Chernobyl: Lessons for the future". With the recent EU enlargement to several countries bordering the former Soviet Union, this will be the first time that Parliament has had the opportunity to debate this issue with the new Member States.
On 3 May 2001, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the problem of nuclear safety fifteen years after the Chernobyl accident, and its health consequences. Commission statement

New eCall technology could save 2,500 lives per year
2006-04-21 - 11:28
MEPs on the Committee on Transport and Tourism recommend that Parliament "supports and encourages" the European eCall initiative that "could save up to 2,500 lives a year and bring about a reduction of up to 15% in the gravity of injuries". This view comes in a non-binding own initiative report tabled by Gary TITLEY (PES, UK) on road safety and the introduction of the eCall system.
The report recommends that all European authorities include eCall information within their public road safety campaigns, and that " the large-scale-roll-out of eCall by 2009 is a priority of the eSafety initiative ".
What is eCall?
Welcomed as "the first building block of intelligent car initiative ", eCall promises to accelerate road-accident response time, reduce the severity of road accidents and therefore contribute " to the objective of reducing road deaths in the EU ". As part of the eSafety initiative, the eCall scheme consists of a harmonisation of in-vehicle emergency call, Europe-wide. The initiative involves an eCall device fitted in road vehicles which is activated in the case of an accident, transmitting " an emergency call with data that goes directly to the nearest emergency call centre " thereby providing information on the location of the accident. In so doing, " the nearest emergency centre (the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)) is notified immediately, and knows exactly where to go ", resulting in " a drastic reduction in the rescue time ".
Currently, some privately developed systems of emergency call exist; however, their penetration of the trans-national market has been very limited. By contrast, " eCall aims to be introduced in all vehicles in Europe, for all trades and types, and to work anywhere the vehicle will be in Europe, thus giving service to more than 100 million persons that can travel abroad annually each year ".
The likely benefits
The introduction of a European-wide eCall service " could save up to 2,500 lives a year and bring about a reduction of up to 15% in the gravity of injuries ". Moreover, through its introduction, the report suggests that the annual external costs of road traffic could be reduced by up to €26 billion and the response time: " by approximately 40% in urban areas and approximately 50% in rural areas ". The faster arrival of rescue teams enables a more efficient clearing of the accident therefore improving congestion levels. The report points out that even when " taking into account the necessary annual investments on the in-vehicle systems, to upgrade the PSAPs and to train the emergency services staff " a substantial cost-benefit savings should still accrue from the initiative.
The costs of the initiative
Nevertheless, the committee also points out the disparity which exists between the costs estimated by the Commission and those estimated by the industry. It therefore invites them " to pursue a deeper cost-efficiency analysis for every action to be undertaken to implement eCall ". Whilst encouraging a " gradual introduction and large-scale roll-out of eCall ", the committee is also aware that new technologies may prove costly and that consumers may be unwilling to pay for these, it thus " calls on all stakeholders to work together to define incentives to speed up the introduction of the eCall incentive ". The report notes the fact that the costs involved may be particularly prohibitive in areas where the service is needed most - in rural or isolated areas.
What needs to be done?
The eCall system is based on the use of 112 (as an emergency number) and E112 (location information requirements in public wireless networks for emergency calls), therefore the committee calls on Member States to complete their implementation as soon as possible. Correspondingly, the committee regrets that Member States have been slow in the adoption and promotion of 112 as an emergency number. Furthermore, the report " stresses the importance of all member states signing the Memorandum of Understanding " - a memorandum produced by the eCall Driving Group (" a group established to produce a framework architecture and a business model for eCall ") which aims to ensure the functioning of eCall in any EU State. It considers that, for any proper improvement to be realised, this memorandum should be " converted into a letter of intent, signed by all stake holders, as soon as possible ".

Financing Trans-European transport networks (TEN-T)
2006-04-21 - 11:28
Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, will be asking the Commission the following questions on financing trans-European transport networks (TEN-T): The completion of the TEN-T has a vital role in fulfilling the Lisbon targets. To increase its competitiveness, Europe needs a coherent network instead of a patchwork of disjointed projects. Should the promised transport network not be delivered, the European institutions would lose their credibility in the eyes of the European regions and citizens.
The Council proposed an amount in the FP 2007-2013 of only €6 billion – less than one third of the amount proposed by Parliament. The Council proposal is clearly not enough even for the cross-border sections of key priority projects. At least €8.175 billion is required for these sections and related infrastructure. In addition a further €4 billion is needed in the short term for other vital aspects of priority projects as they become more mature.
What measures does the Commission intend to take in order to ensure a sufficient amount in the TEN-T budget for co-financing at least the key priority projects in the forthcoming seven years and supporting at least the more vital aspects of other priority projects?
What measures does the Commission intend to take in order that the new financial instruments – initiated by the Council – are made available before the end of 2006 in order to become effective in the period 2007-2013?
How will the Commission ensure at least the amount of €1 billion for the European loan guarantee instrument? Rapporteur Paolo COSTA ALDE IT Oral question to the Commission

Enlargement
Accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania
2006-04-21 - 11:28
Elmar BROK (EPP-ED, DE), Pierre Pierre MOSCOVICI (PES, FR) and Geoffrey Geoffrey VAN ORDEN (EPP-ED, UK), on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee, will be asking the Commission the following questions on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU:
Article 39 of the Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union provides that in the event of a serious risk of a state being manifestly unprepared to meet the requirements of membership by 1 January 2007, the Council may postpone the date of accession by one year. It is for the Commission to propose such a step for consideration by the Council.
In the plenary debate on 12 April 2005, preceding Parliament's assent to the Treaty of Accession, the Council Presidency confirmed that full account will be taken of Parliament’s position on the possible invoking of safeguard measures.
President Barroso confirmed to President Borrell in his letter of 7 April 2005 that 'the Commission would seriously consider the views of the Parliament on the possible use of the postponement clause before issuing any recommendation in this regard, in order to fully associate the European Parliament to any possible decision to postpone accession'.
In view of the progress made by Bulgaria and Romania towards fulfilling the commitments required by the Treaty of Accession, can the Commission confirm that the overall content, direction, and rhythm of reform in the two countries is such that they will be ready for accession by 31 December 2006, notwithstanding some particular areas of concern which may require special measures?
Would the Commission agree that, in particular, the reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption and organised crime are areas of concern needing more decisive efforts and results from Bulgaria and Romania?
Can the Commission provide a clarification of the possibilities in regard to safeguard clauses and other possible measures and what they mean in practical terms, especially in the area of justice and home affairs?
Would the Commission consider introducing a 'close monitoring system' throughout the first three years after accession during which safeguard clauses could be invoked?
Could the Commission indicate the pros and cons for making a recommendation respectively in May or in the Autumn?
a) in regard to the timing of accession by Bulgaria and Romania and
b) in regard to safeguard clauses and any other measures that might possibly be necessary? Oral question to the Commission

Budgetary control
2004 budget discharge: Member States criticised for management of EU funds
2006-04-21 - 11:28
MEPs are prepared to sign off the Commission's 2004 budget but they still want to keep up the pressure on EU governments. The Budgetary Control Committee is insisting on better management of Community funds where these are jointly managed by the Commission and the Member States but is nevertheless recommending that the Commission be granted the 2004 budget discharge.
Rapporteur Jan MULDER (ALDE, NL) has constantly stressed the principle of accountability. " It is not enough to say an action has been carried out; it must be shown how it has been implemented and who is accountable for this implementation ", he says. For this purpose the Budgetary Control Committee is suggesting the introduction of "national management declarations", to be signed by the relevant bodies of the Member States. The latter are responsible for joint management of the Community budget with the Commission and would, therefore, have to take their share of responsibility if errors occur.
The Council did not take up the central proposal of the 2003 discharge, i.e. a similar national declaration but at a higher level: MEPs wanted finance ministers to sign these declarations and thereby become accountable in cases where the EU budget is jointly managed. This idea got a cool reception from the Council in November 2005, with Member States claiming that existing control systems were adequate. In the 2004 discharge, MEPs are now proposing a slightly modified approach: a series of sectoral declarations signed by bodies selected by the Member States themselves.
It should be pointed out that the Court of Auditors, for the eleventh consecutive year, has been unable to establish that " underlying transactions " (all the operations underlying the implementation of the Community budget) are free of irregularities. Under the EU Treaty, the Commission and the Member States are required to ensure "sound financial management" (Article 274), something which cannot be verified completely with the existing control systems.
Mr Mulder believes the Commission should not have to pick up the tab for a problem which originates primarily in the Member States. He stressed " I think the Council must be more responsible and more transparent. Refusing the discharge to the Commission is a nuclear weapon and would mean that the Commission would have to resign. It would not be fair to make the current Commission accountable for the policies of its predecessor. This Commission is cooperating well with the European Parliament to improve the EU's financial management, whereas the Council is resisting ".
Review of Commission's internal control systems needed
The other main plank of the 2004 discharge relates to the accountability of the Commission under the same Article 274, which requires it to manage the Community budget properly. The current system, which is the fruit of the administrative reforms carried out by former Commissioner Neil Kinnock, requires the directors-general to report on their activities, by department and for the whole of the Commission. MEPs believe this system has shortcomings, as the quality of information contained in the reports is not checked and no one is accountable for it.
MEPs therefore urge other senior officials to accept accountability, namely the secretary-general of the Commission, the director-general for the budget and the internal auditor.
Discharge for the other institutions and the EU agencies
Turning to the other EU institutions, which are covered in the reports by Nils LUNDGREN (IND/DEM, SE), the committee decided by a large majority to propose that discharge be granted to the Committee of the Regions.
As to the EU agencies, apart from the " explicit " reservations expressed by the Court of Auditors regarding the European Reconstruction Agency for 2004, MEPs in the committee note that, following enlargement of the EU in 2004, the structures and operating methods of this agency have been affected. They want the Commission to analyse the actual or presumed problems and to propose adjustments to the rules.
In addition to calling on the agencies to make good and proper use of the resources available to them, MEPs in the committee urge them to avoid duplication as far as possible and to detail measures for improving the application of the transparency principle in communication with the public and in recruitment.

MEPs: immunity and statute
Modification of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of MEPs
2006-04-21 - 11:28
Giuseppe GARGANI (EPP-ED, IT), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, will be asking the Council the following questions on the modification of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities.
- Having regard to its resolution of 23 June 2005 (P6_TA(2005)0245) on the amendment of the decision of 4 June 2003 on the adoption of the Statute for the Members of the European Parliament (2005/2124/INI),
- Having regard to the Declaration of 3 June 2005 by Representatives of the Member States, meeting within Council, in which they agreed that 'when an instrument laying down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of duties of Members of the European Parliament is adopted pursuant to the terms of Article 190(5) of the Treaty, they will examine the request of Parliament to revise the relevant provisions of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities of 1965 insofar as it concerns the Members of the European Parliament with a view to reach a conclusion as soon as possible',
- Whereas its resolution of 23 June 2005 considered that the Declaration of 3 June was an essential element for a compromise with the Council on the Statute,
- Whereas its resolution of 23 June 2005 insisted 'that the overall compromise on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament should consist of :
a) a separate and independent examination of that part of the Statute which falls under secondary law and of that part which falls under primary law, and approval of both parts in accordance with the institutional provisions applicable to each of them,
b) with regard to that part which falls under primary law, the Member States are called upon to review the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities of 8 April 1965 in respect of the provisions relating to Members of the European Parliament, taking the Statute approved on 3 and 4 June 2003 as a model',
1. When does the Council intend to convene an Intergovernmental Conference in order to modify the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities in respect of the provisions relating to Members of the European Parliament?
2. Would the Council confirm the agreement that the basis for the IGC will be the Statute approved by the European Parliament on 3 and 4 June 2003?
3. How does the Council intend to involve the European Parliament in that IGC? Rapporteur Giuseppe GARGANI EPP-ED IT Oral question to Council

Education
MEPs support the creation of a European indicator of language competence
2006-04-21 - 11:28
Emmanouil MAVROMMATIS (EPP-ED, EL), for the Education and Culture Committee, will be putting forward an own-initiative report on the promotion of multilingualism and language learning in the European Union and the creation of a "European Indicator of Language Competence."
To encourage mobility in the enlarged EU, the committee says it is important for European citizens to possess knowledge of several languages. The purpose of the European Indicator of Language Competence is to measure overall foreign language competencies in four areas: reading, comprehension, speaking and writing in each Member State. In line with other similar international indicators, data should be gathered at regular intervals, e.g. cycles of three years. The Indicator should record the proficiency of the sample at each of the six levels on the scales of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages of the Council of Europe. This reference framework has gained wide acceptance and is already used in many of the Member States.
During an initial phase, the linguistic proficiency will be tested in the five most widely taught languages in the European Union (English, French, German, Spanish and Italian), but the Committee wants to make sure further languages would be added at a subsequent stage. According to a recent research, 38% of the Europeans speak English as a foreign language while the rates for the other four languages are 14% for German, 14% for French, 6% for Spanish and 3% for Italian.
The Indicator should offer a valuable technical instrument that could help the European Commission obtain reliable information concerning the linguistic proficiency of European citizens, in particular young people. It will also enable comparisons to be made between Member State policies in this area, and will facilitate consultation regarding best practice, thereby giving fresh impetus to language teaching.
The committee believes that Member States should be fully involved in development and implementation of the Indicator. As regards the central coordination of the process and the central analysis of the material provided, this will be carried out by the Commission with external support provided through a contract tendered under normal procedures.

Economic and monetary affairs
State aid for innovation should be an exception, but has its place
2006-04-21 - 11:28
The use of state aid to promote innovation should remain the exception rather than the rule according to own initiative report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which will now be debated by the plenary session. The report, drawn up by Sophia In’t Veld (ALDE, NL), says state aid should be an instrument to correct imbalances that cannot be addressed by regular policy instruments. It highlights some areas where this might be the case.
MEPs in the committee, who are responding to a specific Commission consultation paper following on from the reform proposals for the whole range of state aid policy, say state aid for innovation should be complementary to the relevant EU policies and should have a clear measurable added value for the immediate beneficiaries as well as a secondary impact on the broader local, regional and national economy. Lessons need to be learned from past failures and successes in using aid to foster innovation. The new EU framework should avoid very restrictive definitions and arrangements, while providing for an interim review once the system is up and running.
The report welcomes the idea of transparent, non-discriminatory, practicable ex ante rules which would provide for legal certainty. §8 It says subsidies should be conditional on the characteristics of the economic sector, the market structure and the market power of the company concerned, among other factors.
Ms In’t Veld’s report also insists that state aid for innovation should be temporary, granted according to rational criteria, proportionate, strictly and effectively controlled and subject to periodic impact assessments. It notes that innovative processes as such do not merit state aid, which should only be granted for innovations which cannot be financed by normal commercial means.
MEPs in the committee also stress that SMEs should be allocated a larger share of the aid available. They call for financial support to be given by means of risk capital for seed and start-up phases, and for such support also to be available in the post-seed phase, though this is not an optimal option and should be for the short term only.
Calling for greater clarity on how state aid rules apply to universities and research establishments engaged in economic activities, the committee also calls for them to take part in regional public-private partnerships as ‘ innovation intermediaries .’ Rapporteur Sophia IN 'T VELD ALDE NL A6-0073/2006 Sectoral aspects of the State Aid Action Plan: aid for innovation Procedure : Own-initiative

Asset management: refinements needed to EU rules
2006-04-21 - 11:28
Parliament is to debate a call for clarification and consolidation of the EU’s legislative framework for the asset management industry. This comes in an own-initiative report from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee drawn up by Wolf Klinz (ALDE, DE).
The report says the interaction between the UCITS (undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities) directive, the MiFID (markets in financial instruments directive) and its level 2 measures and the E-commerce directive leaves undesirable scope for interpretation. It calls on the Commission and the other EU bodies involved (CESR and CEIOPS) to ensure a high level of transparency and management of conflicts of interests, notification requirements and thus equal treatment between UCITS and competing products.
The report makes recommendations on a range of issues: investor information and protection, risk management, European passports, management company and depository passports, fund processing standardisation, cross-border consolidation, distribution structures, investment policy, non-UCITS investments, supervision issues and the Lamfalussy process.

External relations
Enhancing relations between the EU and Latin America
2006-04-21 - 11:28
In anticipation of the fourth EU-Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) Summit that is due to take place in Vienna on 12 and 13 May 2006, for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, José Ignacio José Ignacio SALAFRANCA SÁNCHEZ-NEYRA (EPP-ED, ES) has tabled a non-legislative report that aims to help "make a real success" of the Summit.
The report describes the Summit as a " key and particularly propitious moment for strengthening relations between the European Union and Latin America ", and recommends that " an overall strategic vision for the partnership must be preserved at all costs ".
In Rio de Janeiro, June 1999, the Heads of State and Government of Latin America and the Caribbean and the European Union, with the participation of the President of the European Commission, convened in order to enhance the bi-regional strategic partnership between the two regions. The declaration made " has yet to find expression in substantial practical achievements in the political, economic, trade and social spheres ". However the Commission has now put forward a strategy communication " which should help to make it possible to understand the causes, reverse the trend, and finally accord EU-LAC relations the place that they deserve ". In its report, the Committee on Foreign Affairs makes an analysis of the Commission's communication and makes suggestions of its own.
Currently, " the EU is the biggest development cooperation and humanitarian aid donor in Latin America ", with the Latin America economies experiencing a 4.3% increase in their gross domestic product in 2005. Per capita, the GDP in Latin America " varies in the region of EUR 2800 ". Nevertheless, it still remains that 45% of the Latin American population is " still living in poverty and are afflicted by blatant social inequality, discrimination and neglect ". Correspondingly, the report notes that " the Union is emerging as a partner with a key role to play in Latin America's economic, industrial, scientific, and technological development ".
Within the political sphere, the report makes a number of suggestions as to how to further the establishment of a " genuine political and security partnership ". It recommends that, in addition to the Euro-Latin American charter for peace and security, a " stronger political and security partnership must be built...to enable practical expression to be given, under the terms of the United Nations Charter, to policy, strategy, and security proposals of interest to the two regions ". It also promotes the Commission's idea of setting up a bi-regional conflict prevention centre, with a view to placing " political dialogue on conflict prevention and crisis management on the new political agenda ". The report recommends the undergoing of " systematic attempts to seek a Euro-Latin American consensus in the various international organisations and negotiations ", notably in the WTO and the UN. Furthermore, concerning the institutional framework of the partnership, the committee suggests that " regional integration would benefit from two highly necessary material improvements to be made at Vienna ", these being a Euro-Latin American Permanent Secretariat and a Euro-Latin American Transatlantic Assembly. The report advises that the Assembly should become " the keystone of the EU-LAC parliamentary political dialogue, operating alongside an updated ministerial-level dialogue and the role to be played by civil society ".
On economic policy - through a re-submission of a previous proposal - the report suggests creating a Euro-Latin America Free-Trade Area by 2010. Rapporteur José Ignacio SALAFRANCA SÁNCHEZ-NEYRA EPP-ED ES A6-0047/2006 A stronger partnership between the EU and Latin America Procedure : Own-initiative
