The European Parliament has adopted a written declaration calling on the Romanian authorities to take due account of Parliament's opinion and to consequently resume without delay consideration of pending cases of international adoptions, in the best interests of the children, and to authorise international adoption where appropriate.
The European Parliament adopted the resolution on 10 July. So far, 408 MEPs have signed the declaration.
In June 2001 the Romanian authorities imposed a moratorium on international adoption, which was replaced on 1 January 2005 by a law on the protection of children. This moratorium was retroactive to 1 December 2000 and consequently abruptly interrupted consideration of several thousands of applications for adoption. The children whom these applications concerned had already, over a long period, established contacts with their future adoptive families, and whereas this moratorium has therefore placed them for a second time in the situation of being abandoned.
In paragraph 23 of its resolution on the extent of Romania's readiness for accession to the European Union, adopted on 15 December 2005, Parliament urged the Romanian Government 'to settle the cases of applications for international adoption made during the moratorium of June 2001. MEPs say that the Romanian Government has to date not responded to this call.
A written declaration is a text of a maximum of 200 words on a matter falling within the European Unionâ€™s sphere of activities. A group of up to five MEPs can submit a written declaration by presenting a text to be signed by their colleagues. If the declaration is signed by a more than half of all 732 MEPs, it is forwarded to the President who announces adopted in plenary.
