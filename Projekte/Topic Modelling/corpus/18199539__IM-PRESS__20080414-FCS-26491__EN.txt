The Sputnik Space Craft fell from its orbit and Charles De Gaulle came out of retirement to lead France. These were two news events from 1958 which also saw the official formation of what would later become the European Parliament. Videos assembled here mark some of the most iconic moments from the parliament's history.
This feature is dedicated to remembering the first 50 years of debate in the European Parliament after 142 delegates first met on 19th March 1958. When they assembled in Strasbourg in post-war France it was known as the European Parliamentary Assembly.
Some of the videos you can see in this feature include:
1958: The first meeting of the European Assembly
1985: US President Ronald Reagan gets a mixed reaction from MEPs
1985: Pope John Paul II addresses the European Parliament
1992: Queen Elisabeth II visits the European Parliament in Strasbourg
1997: Renault workers interrupt the Plenary
The European Parliament (as it became in 1962) now looks very different from the original Assembly. In terms of size, the current European Parliament has 785 members from 27 countries. This is a stark comparison with the 142 original members from just 6 countries.
From Assembly to Parliament It has also grown into a modern legislature with powers over key aspects of European lawmaking. The co-decision procedure has given the Parliament equal power with the Council of Ministers in areas including, transport, the environment and consumer protection. Along with the Council, Parliament is also the EUâ€™s budgetary authority, deciding each year on expenditure. It also plays a supervisory role over other EU institutions. It began as a Common Assembly for the European Coal and Steel Community, which came into force in 1952. After the signature of the Treaty of Rome in 1957 founded the European Economic Community and Euratom, a Common Parliamentary Assembly was created for all three communities. The first meeting of the combined body was held in Strasbourg in March 1958. In 1962 it changed its named to the European Parliament, a name that was officially designated by the Single European Act of 1986

There's a first time for everything...
The first direct Europe-wide elections, the first debates in Plenary...These are just some of the "firsts" that the European Parliament has had in the course of its history. Take a glance at some notable first moments in the history of the Parliament.
Elections and the European Parliament
Before direct elections were held in 1979, MEPs were appointed by and from the national Parliaments of the Members of the Community (as it then was). In 1979 the first direct elections were held and voters in 9 countries elected 410 MEPs to represent them. In 2004, people in 25 countries of the EU elected representatives to the European Parliament. They were later joined by Members from Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in 2007.
From 6 to 27 members
The new states are welcomed in 2004 The original six countries became 9, then 10, then 12 and so on until they reached 27 last year. Thus far there have been five enlargements of the Union. It took the largest jump in size in 2004 when it went from 15 to 25 members with almost 500 million people. This section records the key moments in the enlargement of the EU. 2004 - 10 new countries join the EU
Young people and the European Parliament
How can young people get involved in the European Parliament? There are various programmes and activities that are organised throughout the Parliamentary term to appeal and involve young people. You can get a flavour by watching this section and seeing young people involved in the Parliament's activities.
Freedom of speech and expression: in favour or against?
Freedom of speech and expression, especially concerning political and other public issues is the very essence of democracy. Demonstrations and various organised events are frequently used to try and influence the thinking of legislators. The European Parliament is no exception. In this section see some examples inside and around the Parliament.
MEPs make themselves heard
With so many nationalities and political parties represented in the Parliament, MEPs are always looking for new and eye-catching ways to get over their views and opinions. Be it bikes, football or even chocolate, MEPs have generally found a way to express themselves. 2004 - Ukraine election
