Lorry drivers' hours: back to square one
Employment policy
2009-09-29 - 19:42
A plan to subject all EU lorry drivers to the same working time rules was unexpectedly rejected by the Employment Committee on Tuesday. The legislative text, which would have called on the Commission to apply these rules to self-employed drivers, as well as those employed by haulage firms, was rejected by 25 votes to 24, because political groups could not agree to include the self-employed.
The rejected text would have required the Commission to withdraw its proposal, which exempts self-employed drivers, and to take steps with Parliament to draft new rules to include them.
The Committee must now draft a new report on Commission proposals to amend the working hours legislation.
In May 2009, MEPs rejected the Commission's plans at the first reading because they would have extended the rules only to "false self-employed" drivers, i.e. those who have no employment contract but are in practice prevented by their sole employer from working for other customers.
MEPs argued then that all drivers, employed or self-employed, should come under the same rules, to protect them and other road users from the health and road safety hazards created by excessive working hours.
