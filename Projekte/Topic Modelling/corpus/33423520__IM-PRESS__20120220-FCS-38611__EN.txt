ACTA logo The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) has proved to be controversial ever since it was first proposed. The agreement is aimed at more effectively enforcing intellectual property rights on an international level. Many developed countries worry that their economies suffer great damage due to counterfeiting and piracy. However, opponents are concerned that it will favour large companies' interests at the expense of citizens' rights.
Its fate now lies in the hands of the European Parliament as without its consent ACTA will not be able to enter into force in the European Union. The European Commission announced on 22 February 2012 that it will refer ACTA to the European Court of Justice for a ruling on the agreement. Parliament will wait for the Court's ruling before drawing any conclusions. However, in the meantime it will continue its own scrutiny of the agreement. Here you will find everything you need to know about ACTA and how the Parliament will come to a decision. It will contain the latest updates, details on how and when to follow committee meetings covering ACTA on the Parliamentary website, as well as useful links to relevant documents.

What you should know about ACTA
Map showing which countries have signed ACTA ACTA, a controversial agreement about counterfeiting and online copyright infringements, has been signed so far by 30 countries. In coming months Parliament will be able to decide its fate in the EU by either approving or rejecting it. But what is this all about? What does ACTA seek to achieve? Why has it provoked protests from groups across the world? How will the Parliament come to a decision and how will you be able to follow the process? Find out more in this briefing.
What is ACTA about? The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is aimed at more effectively enforcing intellectual property rights on an international level. Many countries are worried that their economies suffer great damage due to counterfeiting and piracy. OECD estimated in 2005 that international trade in counterfeit and pirated products amounted to $200 billion, excluding digital products. What will be covered by it? Anything from counterfeit goods to copyright infringements on the internet. Who takes part in ACTA? ACTA was negotiated between the EU and its member states, the US, Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland. Once the agreement is in force, then any member of the World Trade Organisation can apply to join. Why is it controversial? Critics worry the agreement would favour the interests of large companies at the expense of citizens' rights and see its possible application in the online sphere as a threat to people's privacy and human rights. In addition the negotiations have been denounced for a perceived lack of transparency as civil society groups and developing countries have not been involved. Which countries have already signed it? In the EU it has already been signed by all member states except Cyprus, Estonia, Slovakia, Germany and the Netherlands. Outside the EU it has already been signed by Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the US. Why is the role of the European Parliament crucial? The Parliament has to give its consent before ACTA can enter into force in the EU. Since the Lisbon Treaty, the Parliament has the right to veto most of the international agreements concluded by the EU. What options are available to the European Parliament? The Parliament is not able to make any changes to it, being formally empowered to either approve or reject it. Since there is no legal deadline for a response, it is theoretically possible that the Parliament could let the matter pend indefinitely, an option which would in effect prevent ACTA entering into force in the EU, as its explicit consent is required for it to do so. The European Commission announced on 22 February 2012 that it will refer ACTA to the European Court of Justice for a ruling on the agreement. Parliament will wait for the Court's ruling before drawing any conclusions. However, in the meantime it will continue its own scrutiny of the agreement. How will the European Parliament come to a decision? The European Parliament is committed to doing everything in the open and actively encourages people to engage in the process, consult its documents or follow the meetings, which are mainly broadcast live on its website. The preparatory work will be done by the parliamentary committees. The committee on international trade will be in charge and as such will come up with a recommendation for the Parliament to either approve or reject ACTA. British MEP David Martin, a member of the S&D group, has been chosen by the committee to draft the position of the Parliament. However, there will be four other committees which will deliver their opinions on ACTA: the committee on industry, research and energy; the committee on legal affairs; the committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs; and the committee on development. They will spend several months talking to as many stakeholders and interested parties as possible in order to draw on their knowledge and expertise and come to an informed decision. Many, if not all, of their meetings will be broadcast live on the Parliament's website. Once the recommendation to MEPs is available, it will be made publicly accessible. The Parliament will then vote on ACTA during a plenary session, which people will be able to follow live on the website. What has the European Parliament said so far about ACTA? So far there have been three resolutions to call on the Commission to make ACTA documents public and increase the Parliament's role in negotiating the content: a resolution on 11 March 2009 called on the Commission to "immediately make all documents related to the ongoing international negotiations on the ACTA publicly available" a resolution on 10 March 2010 rejected the secrecy around ACTA ("deplores the calculated choice of the parties not to negotiate through well-established international bodies, such as WIPO and WTO") ("expresses its concern over the lack of a transparent process in the conduct of the ACTA negotiations, a state of affairs at odds with the letter and spirit of the TFEU") a resolution on 24 November 2010 welcomes ACTA as a step in the right direction and calls on the Commission to confirm that it will have no impact on basic freedoms and existing legislation What happens if the European Parliament votes in favour? Cyprus, Estonia, Slovakia, Germany and the Netherlands would still have to sign the agreement and all member states would still have to ratify it before it can enter into force in the EU. What happens if the European Parliament rejects it? ACTA will not be able to enter into force in the EU. No agreement would be possible without the consent of the Parliament. However, if six countries outside the EU still ratify it then the agreement will enter into force there. How will I be able to find out the latest developments on this in the European Parliament? On Friday 24 February a feature page dedicated to ACTA will be created, which will then be regularly updated. Live broadcast of meetings will be announced and there will be links to documents that have been released. There will also be regular announcements through the Parliament's Facebook page and Twitter accounts (in 22 different languages).

Vital Moreira on ACTA: "what was allowed will be allowed"
Vital Moreira In the wake of last week's signature of the ACTA Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement by 22 EU countries and EU representatives, public interest has turned to the role of the European Parliament. The EP cannot change the text of the agreement, Chair of the International Trade Committe Vital Moreira explains, it can say yes or no, withhold agreement it or ask the Court of Justice to check it.
What is ACTA? It’s an agreement meant to enforce the means and mechanisms to protect intellectual property rights such as copyrights, patents, geographic indications, brands, industrial design rights - it is not aimed at redefining the scope of that protection. There is a World Trade Organisation (WTO) convention called TRIPS (Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) that the EU and all its member states have signed up to establishing the scope and content of those rights, which foresees enforcement rules. ACTA simply involves an update of the means, mechanisms and remedies to protect intellectual property rights. That’s also the purpose of the existing EU directive, comprising a minimum set of means to protect intellectual property rights. ACTA is a multilateral agreement between some developed economies including the EU, the US and Japan, but also less-developed economies such as Mexico and Morocco, aimed at reinforcing, between those states, the enforcement of intellectual property rights. It does not change the content, everything that was allowed continues to be allowed, everything that was forbidden keeps on being forbidden. It is about being more effective when it comes to infringements of intellectual property rights. Why is it so controversial? The sensitiveness of the issue concerns a small part of the agreement, regarding copyright on the internet, the download of music, literature, theatre and music shows, as well as other works protected by copyright. Many of the arguments used are not foreseen in ACTA. For example, download for private use was not forbidden and is not forbidden, what is forbidden is the infringement of copyright for commercial purposes. Can the EP change the content of ACTA? This is an international agreement and so the consent of the EP is necessary, but it cannot change the text of the agreement, it can only say "yes" or "no" to it. As this agreement has raised legal problems, the EP can ask the EU's Court of Justice to decide on its compatibility with EU law if a committee votes to do so. A political group or number of MEP's can also make that request. If it is referred to the Court, the parliamentary procedure will be suspended until the Court rules. Other committees will also have a say, including the Civil Liberties, Legal Affairs, Development and Industry committees. What happens if the agreement is rejected? If we say yes, the Council is authorised to conclude the agreement and make it binding between the EU and the other member countries. If we say no, the process is over and the treaty is dead. It can be renegotiated, but this one is dead. For a new agreement it would be necessary to start a new procedure, from the Commission proposal to the mandate of the Council, negotiations, signature, etc. In the past the Parliament said no to two agreements: SWIFT and the fisheries agreement with Morocco. How can citizens express their opinion on the agreement? The proposal for the text is already available on our website and an assessment on ACTA prepared for the parliament is also online. Our debates are streamed and can be followed live online. On 1 March, there will be a workshop in which everyone can take part. Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht will be there. Some of the political groups, particularly those against ACTA, are promoting debates on their websites. Citizens have already started flooding MEPs with hundreds if not thousands of emails. All the problems raised concerning the agreement will be debated, not only in the trade committee but also in plenary.

Parliament has received 2.4 million petition signatures against ACTA
Picture of protest against ACTA The EP received on Tuesday a petition signed by more than 2.4 million internet users against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). They fear that the agreement will pose a threat to a free and open internet. The EP's petitions committee will look at the petition before deciding what action to take. Its options vary from asking the European Commission to launch a preliminary investigation to preparing a full report for the Parliament to vote on during a plenary session.
The petition has been organised by Avaaz, an organisation which uses internet to campaign on various issues. Once the petition has been received, the committee will decide whether it is admissible or not. This normally takes one to two months. In special cases an "urgency procedure" can be used to speed up this process. A petition could be declared inadmissible if it does not fall with the EU's area of activity. In this case, no further action will be taken. If a petition is declared admissible, the committee will then decide what type of action should be taken.
Italian Christian-Democrat Erminia Mazzoni, chair of the petitions committee, said: "The ratification procedure of ACTA in the European Parliament has only just started. It will need to be examined carefully, taking into consideration all concerns, through a reasoned assessment of the facts and trying to combine the freedom of the Internet on the one hand and the fight against counterfeiting on the other. The follow-up of the petition will be decided in the coming weeks by the members of the committee on petitions."
The petitions committee works to resolve infringements of citizens' rights through cooperation with local, regional and national authorities on the application of EU law on a range of issues. It is an investigative committee and has no legal power, but tries to find non-judicial remedies for citizens whose claims are substantiated. It can organise fact-finding visits and report to plenary.
ACTA is aimed at more effectively enforcing intellectual property rights on an international level. It has proved controversial because critics worry the agreement would favour the interests of large companies at the expense of citizens' rights and see its possible application in the online sphere as a threat to people's privacy and human rights. It cannot enter into force in the EU unless the Parliament gives its consent and all member states ratify it.
Text of the petition: "To all Members of the EU Parliament: As concerned global citizens, we call on you to stand for a free and open Internet and reject the ratification of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), which would destroy it. The Internet is a crucial tool for people around the world to exchange ideas and promote democracy. We urge you to show true global leadership and protect our rights."

ACTA: MEPs want clarity before taking a decision
David Martin , ACTA rapporteur, pictured during the discussion on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement In the International Trade Committee with MEPs and Commissioner Karel De Gucht. International Trade Committee MEPs from all political groups want to know more about how the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) would be enforced before advising Parliament as a whole on whether or not to approve it, it emerged from the committee's first debate on it on Thursday. David Martin (S&D, UK), who will draft the committee's recommendation, asked it to back his plan to refer ACTA to the European Court of Justice, for a ruling on questions to be prepared by Parliament.
Mr Martin suggested that while the Court of Justice referral is being prepared, the time set aside for Parliament's assent to ACTA should instead be used to prepare an interim report setting out questions to the European Commission and EU Member States on how it is to be enforced. He stressed that Parliament should prepare its own questions, rather than simply associating itself with the European Commission's parallel referral of ACTA to the court. Examples could include questions about how border control agencies would be expected to deal with counterfeit imports, or whether internet service providers would have to enforce ACTA against users, and if so what legislation would require them to do so. Protecting intellectual property rights "We have critical interest in defending EU intellectual property and we need to act in this regard", said Mr Martin, stressing that "it is not the intentions of ACTA that raise concerns but its possible unintentional consequences. ACTA lacks detail. The main concern is how the text might be read". For example, "There is no 'three strikes' rule in ACTA, but we do not know how internet service providers will interpret the tasks given to them and if they will feel that they have the duty to cut people off the internet". "What I plan to do is bring about clarity on ACTA in the next year, to provide the facts for this Parliament to vote", Mr Martin declared, adding that in the coming weeks he planned to meet as many civil society representatives as possible to discuss citizens' concerns while drafting his interim report. Not just a trade deal The EPP group's shadow rapporteur on ACTA , Christofer Fjellner (SE) agreed that Parliament must now scrutinize the ACTA text in detail. "It's not the trade deal that changes citizens' everyday lives but the legislation that enforces it", he told Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht, adding "I've heard from the Commission and Member States that there will not be a big change in legislation. I will not take your word for it. We need to scrutinize it". Mr Martin's position was also welcomed also by Parliament's former rapporteur on ACTA, Kader Arif , who had resigned accusing Parliament of orchestrating a "masquerade" on the ACTA case. "Today I am very happy to see my colleagues thinking differently, Parliament's transparency, openness to public and the direction the ACTA case is taking in Parliament", he said. Robert Sturdy (ECR, UK) backed the European Commission's decision to refer ACTA to the European Court of Justice. ACTA lacks transparency Mr Martin and other speakers objected to the "lack of transparency" in the ACTA negotiations to date and reiterated Parliament's many requests to be more closely involved, and not merely left with the option of accepting or rejecting the existing text. French Green Yannick Jadot complained that "procedural excuses" had been used to avoid involving Parliament, and noted that MEPs had learned of the Commission decision to refer ACTA to the Court of Justice from the press. "I'm not sure that this is in line with our inter-institutional agreement with the Commission", he said. Swedish Green Carl Schlyter complained that emerging economies were not involved in ACTA negotiations, noting that 95% of all counterfeiting takes place in countries that will not be affected by ACTA. He also observed that if the aim now was to spread ACTA via bilateral agreements with countries not yet party to it, this would not be a democratic way to influence other countries. Helmut Scholz (GUE/NGL, DE), also noted that the countries where most piracy takes place are outside ACTA and insisted that it should be tackled through existing international structures instead. "Gobalization raises different challenges and ACTA is the wrong way to handle things", he said. Civil society protests Several MEPs said the Commission must accept its share of responsibility for civil society protests against ACT, since it had not kept people properly informed of the progress of negotiations. "The lack of transparency has created a lot of mistrust. This might be a lesson to the future. We need to change things", said Mr Fjellner. Metin Kazak (ALDE, BG), said that in many Member States, these protests had prompted governments to "give up". "Both in the ACTA text and also in communication about it there are many cumbersome words and phrases - that something will perhaps happen or may happen. In such circumstances you have to expect citizens to be afraid from the possible consequences", he said. Inese Vaidere (EPP, LV), said the Commission had done too little to explain ACTA's benefits, even though there was much to be explained, such as the definitions of terms "counterfeiting" or "commercial scale". "Now it may already be too late. I fear that we don't have much chance of reviving ACTA. The Commission has not done its job", she said. Committee chair Vital Moreira (S&D, PT), defended ACTA on the grounds that intellectual property rights are vital to Europe's ability to innovate and compete. He was sure that properly interpreted, ACTA would not threaten fundamental freedoms. No ACTA enforcement without Parliament's consent Commissioner De Gucht replied that any substantive laws passed to enforce ACTA would be the responsibility of Parliament and Member States. "ACTA cannot be changed into substantive law without Parliament's consent. You are also responsible for that" he said, suggesting that Parliament should pay more attention to Member States' laws that threaten fundamental freedoms. "The so called 'three strikes' rule is effective in French law and that is a law that was passed to implement EU directives. On the contrary, ACTA explicitly states that you can not impose anything similar to three-strikes rule on the international level", he said. Commissioner De Gucht reiterated his view that referring ACTA to the European Court of Justice would be the right decision, as "our responsibility as politicians is to establish the facts and not follow the crowd" and the "Court will provide much needed clarity on our concerns".

ACTA: experts reveal how it could affect civil liberties and access to generic medicine
ACTA workshop at the EP. Speakers in top left photo are Karel De Gucht, EU trade commissioner; Prof. Christophe Geiger, University of Strasbourg; and Dr Michael Geist, University of Ottawa. Does ACTA pose a threat to civil liberties and developing countries' access to generic medicine? Many people oppose the controversial anti-counterfeiting agreement because of concerns over these two issues. MEPs, who will be crucial to deciding the treaty's fate in the EU, staged a special workshop on 1 March to grill experts about their insights into ACTA. Find out how they think the treaty will affect civil liberties and access to generic medicine.
Civil rights Dr Olivier Vrins, of Altius Lawyers, said ACTA states that its provisions should be transposed with respect to fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and freedom to have a fair trial. "Fundamental rights of European citizens are not in serious danger because of ACTA. The idea of proportionality is particularly important because it is applied as well by the European Court of Human Rights when balancing out various fundamental rights which might be in conflict, here the right on property on the one hand and on the other the right of protection of private life, freedom of speech and freedom of access to information. This preservation of fundamental rights means that not only that people would be able to say that certain acts do not infringe intellectual property, but parties must foresee certain exceptions and limits to intellectual property." Rupert Schlegelmilch, of the European Commission's directorate-general for trade, said that the Commission took concerns over civil rights extremely seriously, but there was no real reason to be worried. "Intellectual property is property but it's not property only. Privacy and access to the net are just as important. We believe the treaty strikes a fair balance in that respect. ACTA does not impose a new standard. What will be imposed is what we have. Nothing new will be enforced. What is legal is legal, what is illegal is illegal. ACTA is just about making sure that people do something about it." Generic medicine Dr Meir Pugatch, of the University of Haifa, argued that ACTA will not have an impact on access to generic medicine, as the agreement does not cover patents. "I think that we already have the necessary safeguards today to ensure access to generic medicines, and therefore I don't think ACTA poses any serious concern, nor does it create a serious contribution to the issue. The problem is counterfeited medicines and substandard medicines. If you end up using counterfeited medicine or substandard medicine, it could seriously damage your health. Those who suffer the most from substandard medicines and counterfeited medicines are poor populations." Commission representative Mr Schlegelmilch later added: "Developing countries will be able to continue to buy the generic medicines that they need just as before." However, the British Social Democrat David Martin, who is responsible for steering ACTA through Parliament, said many questions still remained about how the treaty could affect access to generic medicine. "What we don't know is how border agencies will be asked to define counterfeit medicine as opposed to generic medicine, especially when many of these medicines that arrive at the frontier are packaged and labelled similarly to the original medicine. How will this operate?" Mr Martin said the workshop showed there was a need for more information, which is why it would be good for the European Court of Justice to give a ruling on questions to be prepared by Parliament. "There is an English expression where we say the devil is in the detail. The problem with ACTA is that the devil is in the lack of details. We don't have enough information on many of the areas where in the end we will have to make a judgment on." ACTA feature ACTA text External study on ACTA
