EU wide steps to open up the gas and electricity market were debated by MEPs Tuesday ©BELGA At the opening of the April session MEPs held a minute's silence for the victims of the recent Italian earthquake which killed 295 people killed and left about 40.000 homeless. Later, the House debated electricity and gas liberalisation and its potential benefits for consumers. A new regulation on capping roaming charges for mobile phones and the EU budget for 2007 were also debated.
Opening the session in Strasbourg Parliament's President Hans - Gert Pöttering said "we deeply sympathize with Italian victims and homeless. Our thoughts are with the injured and all those affected by this disaster". A moment of silence was then observed. On Wednesday the House will debate what lessons can be learned. A debate will be held on the Abruzzo earthquake on Wednesday .
Better consumer protection with electricity and gas liberalisation
Tuesday saw the House debate on the so-called "third energy package" concerning the liberalisation of Europe's electricity and gas markets. In essence the measure aims to separate generation from supply. MEPs stressed that the consumer would have more choice about which energy company to use as well as clearer and more comparable prices.
The House will decide whether to back the agreement deal reached between EU government Ministers and the EP committee handling this legislation in a vote on Wednesday.
Cheaper calling, texting and mobile internet surfing as of 1 July 2009
MEPs supported on Tuesday new cuts in charges for calls, texts and internet surfing when abroad. A maximum price of €0.43 per minute for calls made abroad and €0.11 for text messages will apply as of 1 July 2009.
Vote will take place on Wednesday on the first reading of this proposed EU-wide regulation.
Debates on 2007 budget management and illegal timber
Regarding the EU budget for 2007, MEPs overall gave it a clean bill of health by granting "discharge" to the responsible bodies. A separate debate will however be held on expenditure by Council on Wednesday.
MEPs also criticised errors made in some areas of spending and stressed the need for simpler procedures and better cooperation between the member states in checking EU spending and recovering incorrectly spent funds.
Turing to illegal logging MEPs stressed the need to make the rules on timber sold in the EU stricter with financial penalties for those who transgress. Currently 20 to 40% of global industrial wood production is from illegal sources which cause severe environmental and economic damage.
